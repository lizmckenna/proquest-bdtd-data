In this period the Peruvian social and economic had underwent extensive changes. After the War of the Pacific, by the stimulus of global economic system, an oligarchic group consisted mainly of agro-exporters and miners had dominated the state. But with the economic modernization, various conflicts in the oligarchic groups sharpened and the traditional parties gradually declined, the oligarchic regime had been challenged. Meanwhile in the northern coastal area that most modernized, the social structure had changed too. In the cane plantations in La Libertad and Lambayeque a new rural proletariats emerged. While in Lima and other big cities, with the development of modern industries an urban proletariat began to write their history. They organized and struggled to defend their legal rights under the influence of European socialism. The Great Depression worsened the lives of those lower groups and aggravated the conflicts between the masses and the oligarchic group. With the decline of traditional oligarchic regime and the rise of the masses, Haya de la Torre outstood as a leader in the Eight-hour Work Day Movement and May 23 Demonstration. He gradually won the support of the masses. During the ouster life overseas he developed the ideology of Aprismo and founded the Peruvian Aprista Party in 1930 eventually. From then on APRA officially entered the Peruvian history and grew to be one of the most important parties in Peru. Its debatable role in the national integration had begun. So this paper is focused on the relationship between the origin of APRA and the Peruvian social transition. In dealing with the problem it is hoped to reveal the changes of different social classes, the difficulties of the transition from an oligarchic regime to a modern regime in the early stage of modernization and the role of a populist party in the national integration. Moreover this case research is committed to offer a deeper understanding of the modernization process in Latin America.",1026779639, 秘鲁社会变动与阿普拉党的兴起：1883-1932,Dissertations & Theses," Xie, Wei XuXieXuWeiXie, Wei Xu谢徐玮",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2713961411 , 70437002 , 189128 , H313770 , H313770", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, Chinese, Chinese, 秘鲁社会变动与阿普拉党的兴起：1883-1932,2006,PQDT - Global,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026779639?accountid=14496, 0506 World History, 0506 World History, 0506 World History,, 0506 World History, World History," (UMI)AAIH313770 , Social sciences , #8226 , APRA , Haya de la Torre , Peru , origin , social change , 兴起 , 德拉托雷 , 社会变动 , 秘鲁 , 阿亚&amp , 阿普拉党",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Social+Change+in+Peru+and+the+Origin+of+APRA&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Xie%2C+Wei+Xu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Preliminary Study on Theory and History of Western Modern Landscape Design,"The Preliminary Study on Theory and History of Western Modern Landscape Design In 1990s, as China's economic prosperity and environmental awareness has increased, the landscape industry in China was an unprecedented rapid development of its content and form are covered traditional Chinese garden with its complex origins, but also because of its colorful design concepts and design language highlights the rapid development of social energy.

In Ecuador, the shrimp farming industry has grown exponentially since its introduction in 1969 and is now the main producing country of cultured shrimp in Latin America. But its rapid and uncontrolled expansion has led to a 57% reduction of mangrove forest in the country, and has had considerable impacts on the poor afro- Ecuadorian coastal communities decreasing the area available to them for obtaining their livelihoods. In turn this has generated a breakdown in the traditional resource allocation and management strategies, further adding to the social exclusion of already marginalised groups who are mainly Afro-Ecuadorians. This thesis explores the complexities of social, political and economic changes that have arisen in mangrove communities since the introduction of shrimp farming in the Mangrove Ecological Reserve (REMACAM). Located in the north of the Esmeraldas Province this is the last pristine mangrove ecosystem in Ecuador, harbouring some 6,000 traditional inhabitants. The research focuses on how the affected populations have responded to these changes, and how they have engaged with national neo-liberal reforms in order to be able to defend and manage the ecosystem. Research focuses on the dichotomous way in which mangroves are perceived in Ecuador today. Outsider perceptions see mangroves as mosquito ridden wastelands. This representation has made possible the development and expansion of the shrimp farming industry at the expense of the mangrove ecosystem. On the other hand, insider perspectives see mangroves as a multiple use ecosystem and a livelihoods provider. These understandings have been successfully used by the mangrove defence movement (CCONDEM) to create a strong movement against the shrimp farming industry. Using an insider perspective the mangrove defence movement has engaged with the country's neoliberal reforms, created national and international alliances and has also created a new political space of resistance. This space includes challenging, and changing national legislation, and proposing new legislation and management strategies to defend the mangroves and the traditional communities whose livelihoods depend on the ecosystem",1773283541,,Dissertations & Theses," Ocampo-Thomason, PatriciaOcampo-ThomasonPatriciaOcampo-Thomason, Patricia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3984737361 , 45126111 , 101309 , U210794 , U210794 , http://hdl.handle.net/10443/1584", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1773283541?accountid=14496, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0503 Agricultural economics, Agricultural economics," http://hdl.handle.net/10443/1584 , DXN098102 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+use+of+local+knowledge+for+the+defence+and+sustainable+management+of+mangrove+ecosystems%3A+the+case+of+ecuador&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ocampo-Thomason%2C+Patricia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Dynamics of internal labour migration in Malawi,"A report by the Global Commission for International Migration submitted to the United Nations in October, 2005, brought the issue of migration onto the international agenda.  As an issue for both developing and developed countries, the migration debate is concerned with balancing the economic benefits with the social and political implications.  World Bank (2005) considers migration as a growing challenge for policy makers in view of the rising number of migrants in the world today, which is estimated at 200 million. Malawi as a developing country faces similar challenges with respect to migration. The pattern of labour movements in Malawi involves three main areas: the rural, the agricultural estates and the urban centres.  This thesis explores in detail these labour movements focusing on the rural-estates (rural) and rural-urban migration flows. A review of economic theories and empirical evidence available in the current body of literature is conducted.  Following this review, a modified version of the Harris-Todaro model is applied to original Malawian data to analyse determinants of migration. Results show that the Harris-Todaro model performs reasonably well in explaining migration in Malawi. Overall the results suggest that urban migrants move in response to expected incomes.  However this is not the case with estate migrants who appear to move due to push factors.",301654798,,Dissertations & Theses," Phiri, M.

The study highlights the contradictory trends of diversity and convergence at the workplace; the segmented nature of living spaces; a weakening of state-institutional linkages; and a dominant drift towards a de-politicised, enterprise-centric unionism: all reflexive of the marketing trends of globalisation.  At the same time, the thesis challenges the argument of uniform responses to globalisation and 'race to the bottom' in developing economies, specifically in production processes and management practices, as well as a uniformity in the impact on workers and responses or trade unions, specifically the decline of traditional trade unionism and the proposition that social movement unionism strengthens the trade union movement. The key findings indicate that there are significant differences in the labour management strategies and practices of the firms studied.  Differential practices lead to differential outcomes for the firms and workers.  Just as all firms do not respond in the same way to the pressures of global competition, workers and trade union responses vary too with varied outcomes for trade unions.  There is evidence of capacity of workers to exercise agency even in a constrained environment and significant differences in the forms and structures of trade unions.  Likewise, the responses towards and prospects for social movements vary that may be contextually determined with different, even opposing outcomes.",301675334,,Dissertations & Theses," Trivedi, AnitaTrivediAnitaTrivedi, Anita",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760726411 , 45122731 , 101309 , U218806 , U218806", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301675334?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0454 Management, Management," DXN101262 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Glbal+factory%2C+indian+worker&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Trivedi%2C+Anita&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A history of bulgaria's environmental movement,"This work seeks to address the history of Bulgaria's environmental movement.  The work's main aim is to examine which actors have had the greatest positive impact on the reform and improvement of Bulgaria's environmental condition, legislation and institutions. The environmental movement itself will be dealt with in two separate branches, both of them viewed through the lens of new social movement theory.  The first of these is the more well-known and popular political branch that first developed in response to the environmental crisis in the town of Ruse in the 198s.  The Ruse Committee laid the groundwork for the rise of dissident intelligentsia organizations in Sofia, including the two most famous political environmental organizations - Ekoglasnost and the Green Party.  The paper will examine their history, how the communist regime dealt with the environment organizations, and their actions, achievements and eventual downfall during the democratic transition. The second branch is comprised of the environmental non-governmental organizations.  These groups have a rich and deserving history that has hitherto gone unmentioned in works dealing with Bulgaria's post-communist history.  This work will not only illuminate a section of Bulgarian history left totally in the dark, but offer an enlightening contrast to the more popular political movement. The work also looks at the other two main actors that have influenced Bulgaria's environmental sector - domestic politicians and international institutions.  The history of their involvement in the environment and relations with the two branches of the movement is important because it completes the historical picture of the environmental movement and also informs the current state and future prospects of the movement and the environment.",301681786,,Dissertations & Theses," Tejada, Matthew StevenTejadaStevenMatthewTejada, Matthew Steven",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760703431 , 44154571 , 101309 , U219713 , U219713", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301681786?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," DN102395 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+history+of+bulgaria%27s+environmental+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tejada%2C+Matthew+Steven&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Gender, social change and spiritual power: a study of charismatic christianity in accra, ghana","In Ghana, the 'new' charismatic churches dominate the religious scene, especially in urban centres such as Accra, the capital.  This thesis is based on research conducted in three of Accra's new churches.  Against a backdrop of debate concerning the role of Pentecostalism as a mediator of 'modernity', the thesis examines the interaction between charismatic Christianity, social change and gender in contemporary Ghana. Ghanaian gender politics are characterised by the concept of 'gender complementarity', which is reproduced in the discourses of the charismatic churches.  The new churches also introduce an element of 'individualism' to discourses on women, which creates tension between women's social roles and their individual trajectories.  In charismatic Christianity, however, individualism is complicated by the power and authority of pastors.  This thesis examines the leadership roles of female pastors and pastors' wives.  It illustrates how the 'big women' of Ghana's charismatic movement both produce new forms of gendered authority and re-legitimise established norms. The thesis also considers charismatic discourses on men, marriage and family life.  Constructions of family life in the new churches correspond with a broader cultural shift towards the individuated nuclear family system.  This is illustrated, in particular, by the churches' focus on the importance of romance, intimacy and conjugal love.  The gender discourses of the charismatic churches are also 'spiritualised'.  The thesis considers the role of spiritual power in interpreting gendered social change.  It argues that the religious practices of the new churches provide believers with access to spiritual power, which sometimes they use to mediate their gendered relationships. The thesis concludes that charismatic Christianity represents an instance of 'hybridity' in which local and global gender discourses intersect.  As a global phenomenon, charismatic Christianity is a source of counter-cultural critique.  Its spiritualised discourses, however, remain firmly rooted in Africa's religious imagination.",301688852,,Dissertations & Theses," Clifford, Jane ElizabethCliffordElizabethJaneClifford, Jane Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

Following the introduction (Chapter 1), the theoretical framework (Chapter 2), and methodology (Chapter 3), the thesis turns to the Shuar case study itself.  Specifically, Chapter 4 presents an overview of indigenous struggles and oil politics in Ecuador that sets the scene for the empirical analysis of Chapters 5, 6, and 7.  Thus, in Chapter 5 the aim is to examine the way in which the Shuar struggle has been partly about the articulation of Shuar cultural identity and its deployment in political battles with both the Ecuadorian State and transnational oil companies.  In contrast, Chapter 6 considers how that struggle has itself come to be defined in terms of particular geographical notions of Shuar territoriality and sense of place.  Here, the effort by the Shuar movement to advance indigenous interests through the interweaving of ancestral and ecological claims is explored.  Then, in Chapter 7 the ways in which the Shuar struggle involves a complex politics of land and resource access is investigated.  Finally, Chapter 8 summarises the findings of the thesis and distils a possible future research agenda from those findings.",301720479,,Dissertations & Theses," Bjureby, ErikaBjurebyErikaBjureby, Erika",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1760784801 , 45134121 , 101309 , U215403 , U215403 , https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-political-ecology-of-indigenous-movements--a-case-study-of-the-shuar-peoples-struggles-against-the-oil-industry-in-the-ecuadorian-amazon(591ee49c-fbe2-4632-b3f0-1266e4e215fd).html", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301720479?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-political-ecology-of-indigenous-movements--a-case-study-of-the-shuar-peoples-struggles-against-the-oil-industry-in-the-ecuadorian-amazon(591ee49c-fbe2-4632-b3f0-1266e4e215fd).html , DXN101033 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+political+ecology+of+indigenous+movements%3A+a+case+study+of+the+shuar+people%27s+struggles+against+the+oil+industry+in+the+ecuadorian+amazon&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bjureby%2C+Erika&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Human recognition of basic emotions from posed and animated dynamic facial expressions,"Facial expressions are crucial for social communication, especially because they make it possible to express and perceive unspoken emotional and mental states. For example, neurodevelopmental disorders with social communication deficits, such as Asperger Syndrome (AS), often involve difficulties in interpreting emotional states from the facial expressions of others. Rather little is known of the role of dynamics in recognizing emotions from faces. Better recognition of dynamic rather than static facial expressions of six basic emotions has been reported with animated faces; however, this result hasn't been confirmed reliably with real human faces. This thesis evaluates the role of dynamics in recognizing basic expressions from animated and human faces. With human faces, the further interaction between dynamics and the effect of removing fine details by low-pass filtering (blurring) is studied in adult individuals with and without AS. The results confirmed that dynamics facilitates the recognition of emotional facial expressions. This effect, however, was apparent only with the facial animation stimuli lacking detailed static facial features and other emotional cues and with blurred human faces. Some dynamic emotional animations were recognized drastically better than static ones. With basic expressions posed by human actors, the advantage of dynamic vs. static displays increased as a function of the blur level. Participants with and without AS performed similarly in recognizing basic emotions from original non-filtered and from dynamic vs. static facial expressions, suggesting that AS involves intact recognition of simple emotional states and movement from faces. Participants with AS were affected more by the removal of fine details than participants without AS. This result supports a ""weak central coherence"" account suggesting that AS and other autistic spectrum disorders are characterized by general perceptual difficulties in processing global vs. local level features.",304905833,,Dissertations & Theses," Katsyri, Jari ViljamiKatsyriViljamiJariKatsyri, Jari Viljami",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1448178521 , 38667161 , 66569 , 9789512285372 , C829633 , C829633", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9789512285372, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304905833?accountid=14496," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0984 Computer science"," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0984 Computer science"," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0984 Computer science",," 0384 Behavioral psychology , 0984 Computer science"," Behavioral psychology , Computer science"," Psychology , Applied sciences , Asperger syndrome , Emotions , Facial expressions , Movement perception , Recognition , Social cognition",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Human+recognition+of+basic+emotions+from+posed+and+animated+dynamic+facial+expressions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Katsyri%2C+Jari+Viljami&amp;isbn=9789512285372&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Putting corporate codes of conduct regarding labor standards in a global -national -local context: A case study of Reebok's athletic footwear supplier factory in China,"This thesis examines the dynamics, possibilities and limitations of corporate codes of conduct---one kind of private regulation tool regarding labor practices flourishing in the past decade's escalating anti-sweatshop campaigns and corporate social responsibility movement---in improving China's labor standards under global-national-local context. Concentrating on athletic footwear industry, this thesis explores the emergence, development and implementation of labor-related codes of conduct through a case study of CSR discourses and practices of Reebok---a leading branded company enjoying a high-profiled image for its human rights achievement---in a large Taiwanese-invested footwear factory (anonymously referred as FS) which is located in Fuzhou city, Fujian province, China and produces for Reebok. I found the implementation of Reebok labor-related codes at workplace of FS had paradoxical effects on improving labor standards---although codes implementation resulted in a ""race to ethical and legal minimum"" when the most inhumane and obviously illegal sweatshop labor abuses were curbed, Chinese workers of FS were forced to work harder, faster but earn less payment and the employee-elected trade union installed in FS worked more like a ""company union"" rather than an autonomous workers' organization representing worker' interests. Furthermore, to explain the limited effectiveness of codes in improving labor standards, especially on issues of living wage and workers' rights to freedom of association and collective bargaining, I found the result was determined by both interconnected structural prohibiting forces embedded in industrial, international, national and local contexts and negotiated agencies of international labor right advocacy groups, consumers, Reebok, FS management, and local branches of Chinese official trade union.",304911763,,Dissertations & Theses," Yu, XiaominYuXiaominYu, Xiaomin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1276405981 , 35906451 , 66569 , 3250560 , 3250560", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304911763?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations,, 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," Social sciences , Athletic footwear , China , Codes of conduct , Corporate , Factory , Globalization , Labor standards , Reebok",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Putting+corporate+codes+of+conduct+regarding+labor+standards+in+a+global+-national+-local+context%3A+A+case+study+of+Reebok%27s+athletic+footwear+supplier+factory+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yu%2C+Xiaomin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Twentieth-century mission theology: Conciliar and evangelical streams in conversation,"This dissertation is the result of four years of intentional research, and many years of unintentional cultivation of a great passion for the work of missions. It would be virtually impossible for me to cover all that happened in the area of theology of mission during the last century. Therefore, I limited its focus and content to a few key meetings of the Protestant Movement that really represented breakthroughs in the understanding of mission in the last century. The meetings I covered can be divided in four major groups: (a) the International Missionary Council meetings in Edinburgh (1910), Jerusalem (1928), Tambaram or Madras (1938), Whitby (1947), Willingen (1952); (b) the World Council of Churches assemblies of New Delhi (1961), Upsala (1968), and Nairobi (1975), (c) the Commission on World Mission and Evangelism of the WCC gatherings in Mexico (1963), Bangkok (1972), Melbourne (1980), San Antonio (1989), and Salvador 1996; and (d) the Evangelical gatherings in Wheaton and Berlin (1966), Lausanne (1974), Manila (1989), and Pattaya (2004). By focusing only in a few key gatherings among of the hundreds of mission oriented meetings that took place around the world during the period of time covered by our studies, I hope to have captured the dynamics of the Protestant understanding of mission mostly in two major areas, evangelism and social work.

This work examines the confluence of factors leading to the group's emergence, peak, and ultimate decline in the late 1990s. Ubiquitous accounts of Islamist violence are often reductive in nature, prompting fruitless debates about the nature of Islam itself. This dissertation is based upon the premise that religion, while crucially important, performs a largely mobilizing function in contexts where other methods of mobilization are precluded. Islam provides a deeply resonant idiom for processing and ultimately challenging the sociopolitical realities of the contemporary world. One need only consider the Islamist's appropriation of intellectually and emotionally charged concepts like jahiliyya and jihad to appreciate religio n's enormous potential for mobilization. Violent Islamist movements represent a fractional percentage of the Islamist tendency. An attempt has been made here to understand what conspires to cause individuals---often young, educated ones---to take up arms against their co-religionists and their government. To do so requires a historical understanding of Islamism as a quintessentially 20 th century phenomenon, rooted in the upheavals of colonialism and nationalism, disintegrative processes of modernization, and global Western economic and cultural dominance, among others. The breakdown of traditional structures occasioned by these crosscutting processes left a void that Islamism---in its varied manifestations---would attempt to fill. This dissertation investigates the contextual background of Islamism in Egypt, charting its emergence from the formation of the Ikhwan al-Muslimiin in 1928 through its eventual fragmentation into violent factions. From this fragmentation al-Jama'a al-Islamiyya would arise. Subsequent chapters scrutinize the political and economic contexts that fostered violence. Authoritarian politics coupled with social fissures between rich and poor, north and south, and traditional and Western-oriented social strata created an environment fertile to the rise of a violent challenger to the status quo. Structures and practices of the organization are examined, as is the government's multifaceted response to the Islamic Group's challenge to its legitimacy. The concluding segment assesses the conflict and makes predictions for future unrest in Egypt.",304918024,,Dissertations & Theses," Davidson, Charles RobertDavidsonRobertCharlesDavidson, Charles Robert",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1059998171 , 32406421 , 66569 , 9780542490798 , 054249079X , 3203487 , 3203487", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542490798 , 054249079X", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304918024?accountid=14496," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science"," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science",," 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0615 Political science"," International law , International relations , Political science"," Social sciences , Egypt , Insurgency , Islamist , Political violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+violence+in+Egypt%3A+A+case+study+of+the+Islamist+insurgency%2C%0A1992%E2%80%931997&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Davidson%2C+Charles+Robert&amp;isbn=9780542490798&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Controlling narratives, controlling histories: Political discourses of anticolonial nationalism","This dissertation spawned from interlocking historical-theoretical themes, which together constitute a coherent whole. First, it argues that opting out of empire either violently or through 'democratic gradualism' was not without its acrimonious fight over the control of the historical narrative between the anticolonial movements and the British Empire. The third postulates that although decolonisation and national liberation constitutes a central experience for Africa and Asia, on no other continents (with the exception of Latin America) since the Nineteenth Century, has the need to construct a counter historical narrative in defense of its epistemological and ontological modern historical consciousness against a Hegelian World-Order of History been so palpable. Thus the implications for the construction of counter historical narratives or alternative discourses to decolonisation and national liberation are far-reaching to say the least. This dissertation then, has sought to explore and locate how the struggle over the control of the historical narrative of decolonisation or national liberation expressed itself both as a psycho-historical and psycho-cultural process among differing actors. It is thus a world-historical sociology of knowledge, which investigates how contending social and historical actors construct historical narratives to justify and manage their historical-political positions as in the case of Great Britain and her colonies after World War II. It is also additionally concerned with how Great Britain, the anticolonial intelligentsia and the critical mass interpret the process of decolonisation and national liberation. It therefore concludes that global-local interaction of events speaks to the way in which decolonisation and national liberation are necessarily world systemic processes and not simply local contingencies. However, since decolonisation and national liberation has indeed engaged politicians, scholars and activists alike, my inquiry also raise and engage the scholarship on nationalism by analyzing the production of discourses in relation to the ""critical mass struggles""---those historical actors whose history almost by definition appear to be episodic. I argue that continuous mass resistance in fact, presents a different long-term temporal trajectory that goes beyond the simple distinction between ""proto"" versus ""nationalism proper"" and ""social"" versus ""national liberation"" movements and makes problematic the moment of nationalism and its historical agents.",304928920,,Dissertations & Theses," Yidana, Richard J.

It does so by drawing on the case of the mainstreaming of a market-centred grassroots banking program called microfinance. Based on a bi-national comparative research on the mainstreaming of the microfinance sector in Nepal and Vietnam, the three papers investigate the broader political-economic restructurings of the 1990s that frame the widespread expansion of microfinance. Additionally, informed by case studies of four microfinance projects (two in each country), the papers examine the social and planning implications of the ascendance of grassroots programs like microfinance. Paper I engages in a historical investigation of the global microfinance movement in order to (1) highlight how the foundational policies of microfinance were borne out of a strongly anti-welfarist stream of grassroots politics; and (2) show how the mainstreaming of microfinance serves to entrench this anti-welfarist grassroots politics, in line with neoliberalization processes. Paper II discusses the political implications of the subtle everyday tactics that microfinance clients engage in to subvert the key processes of microfinance projects. By bringing these subversive tactics to the fore, I highlight how the dominant policies in microfinance are out of sync with the complex borrowing patterns and the real needs of marginalized communities. Paper III investigates why some leading microfinance implementers of Nepal and Vietnam are facing major institutional crisis from 2000 onwards, and are scaling back their involvement in microfinance. The key argument of this dissertation is that the widespread proliferation of market-centered grassroots programs like microfinance does not reflect the potential of such programs to promote social welfare; rather, this trend is indicative and constitutive of the emergence of a new strain of neoliberalism---which I term ""grassroots neoliberalism"". Drawing on the microfinance case, the three papers attempt to understand the hegemonic expressions of grassroots neoliberalism. At the same time, the papers reveal the contradictions and limitations of grassroots neoliberalism and document cases that foreground its imminent decline from 2000 onwards.",304931116,,Dissertations & Theses," Shakya, Yogendra BahadurShakyaBahadurYogendraShakya, Yogendra Bahadur",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1184159271 , 34160041 , 66569 , 9780494158128 , NR15812 , NR15812", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494158128, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304931116?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," Social sciences , Grassroots , Microfinance sector , Neoliberalism , Nepal , Nineteen 90s , Vietnam",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Grassroots+neoliberalism+and+the+reconstitution+of+development+in+the+1990s%3A+The+case+of+the+mainstreaming+of+the+microfinance+sector+in+Nepal+and+Vietnam&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shakya%2C+Yogendra+Bahadur&amp;isbn=9780494158128&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Making New Brunswickers modern: Natural and human resource development in Mactaquac Regional Development Plan: 1965–1975,"This study examines the Mactaquac Regional Development Plan, one of the largest and most comprehensive schemes undertaken by the Canadian federal and provincial governments in the 1960s and 1970s to address economic and social underdevelopment. It is a case study in the larger history of regional development initiatives and efforts to ""modernize"" economically disadvantaged regions in Canada and elsewhere during this period. It approaches regional development from the perspective of both the planners and counselors administering lofty and expansive plans and the people that were most affected by the changes that took place in the area. Informed by a broader international movement, Canadian regional development policy began increasing its scope beyond industrial infrastructure in the 1960s. In the end, the Mactaquac scheme raised expectations that it failed to meet. The residents of the Mactaquac area dramatically altered their existence in the name of progress and modernity but were not the principal beneficiaries of the economic development that was created as a result of the plan.",304935056,,Dissertations & Theses," Dickison, Joshua JohnDickisonJohnJoshuaDickison, Joshua John",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1682724611 , 40898821 , 66569 , 9780494466599 , MR46659 , MR46659", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494466599, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304935056?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0999 Urban planning"," 0334 Canadian history , 0999 Urban planning"," 0334 Canadian history , 0999 Urban planning",," 0334 Canadian history , 0999 Urban planning"," Canadian history , Urban planning", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+New+Brunswickers+modern%3A++Natural+and+human+resource+development+in+Mactaquac+Regional+Development+Plan%3A++1965%E2%80%931975&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dickison%2C+Joshua+John&amp;isbn=9780494466599&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Crossing the border with divine assistance: &lt;i&gt;Ex-voto &lt;/i&gt; paintings of Mexican immigrants to the United States,"This thesis examines the ex-voto paintings of Mexican immigrants to the U.S. to construct a picture of the daily experiences of immigrants. The production and reception of ex-votos testify to the role of art in transnational social processes. Ex-votos are products of popular religion and are offered as votives of thanks to Christ or Virgin Mary. These paintings provide art historical, ethnographical and literary evidence of socio-economic circumstances of the Mexican---United States immigration from the point of the immigrants. I argue that the effects of globalization of capital and internationalization of labor are materialized in the ex-votos of the immigrants. The painful process of immigration produces poignant visual manifestations that address dislocation and oppression.

As notions of statehood evolved, the state assumed responsibility for educating its citizenry, authority which has stood the test of time. Institutions evolved relying on external support in exchange for suasion over what was taught and to whom, evolving a dynamic symbiosis as all players realized positive outcomes from their engagement in education. In today's more complex context, each player continues to realize value in supporting education and in supporting international student mobility. This dissertation places the activity of mobility in historical, political, educational and global contexts that illustrate the evolving role of the state in supporting higher education, and the state's continuing attempts to influence the course of education through the more modern activity of student mobility. Trends such as globalization and massification are addressed, as is internationalization, to explain the rationale of the state for this continued engagement and the motivations of primary stakeholders---the state, the institution and the individual---to support study abroad. Positive outcomes are achieved by all players, hence their ongoing support. But what are these outcomes? A continuum of potential international learning outcomes is established from which the primary stakeholders choose hoped-for outcomes to motivate their engagement; these include economic and linguistic imperatives as well as intellectual, social and personal/attitudinal outcomes. The literature review leads to a methodology and research instrument used on a population of sojourners to test for the achievement of these outcomes and if achievement is significantly and causally related to the study abroad activity itself; or perhaps to some other variable. Data are conclusive and corroborate previous studies in showing positive intellectual and personal outcomes. Recommendations are made on the current research and for other research topics germane to the field of outcomes study. Of import is an exploration of the data's applicability for practitioners in pursuing outcomes-motivated programming, and the adaptation of new mobility models to replace much of the laissez-faire mobility programming common today, towards achieving sought-after outcomes and the internationalization objectives of institutions.

Specific focus was placed on how individuals who share common settlement experiences had distinct interpretations, explanations and definitions of these similar events. Fifteen participants contributed to this research by doing semi-structured interviews. I posited that the participants would have cohesive stories about their settlement experiences, each with a beginning, a middle, and an end. This hypothesis was based on the theory that people present their lives to themselves and others in the form of narratives, either verbally or internally, to create coherence, consciously or otherwise, out of sometimes contradictory or confusing events and feelings. All narratives were informed in their own way by intersubjective experience and knowledge. Many of the participants had similar notions of migration, and many also had shared or partially shared norms and social understandings pertaining to gender, education, socio-economic status, and English as a second language. However, each narrative also reflected the distinctiveness of each participant. The participants' narratives were shaped by their particular experiences of culture and identity, transnational connections across borders, and relationships with both co-ethnic groups and others. Several key issues emerged from this research. The participants described many experiences which demanded different kinds of adaptation and change, and each pointed to different strategies with which they responded. The participants had a shared knowledge of how immigration and settlement commonly occur, and by their accounts their own experiences were distinct and often deviated from this norm. The definitions and meaning that each participant applied to his or her settlement process were highly personalized, reflecting the circumstances of his or her settlement and his or her individual identity. By presenting and discussing new immigrants' narratives of settlement, this research represents the participants' untold stories of the moving home which, when told, are verbalizations of the process of movement, adaptation, change and growth into new cultural surroundings and a modified personal identity. This research allowed for a greater understanding of the individual experience of settlement, and for the realization that there are multiple, diverse kinds of immigration.",304955024,,Dissertations & Theses," LaTouche, AmeliaLaToucheAmeliaLaTouche, Amelia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1260793811 , 33063281 , 66569 , 9780494225394 , MR22539 , MR22539", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494225394, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304955024?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Manitoba",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Narratives+of+settlement%3A+Immigration%2C+change+and+identity+among+new+immigrants+to+Winnipeg&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=LaTouche%2C+Amelia&amp;isbn=9780494225394&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""“My heart, the number one”: Singing in the lives of South Korean survivors of Japanese military sexual slavery","During the Pacific War, the Japanese imperial army took between fifty- and 200,000 girls and young women from Korea and elsewhere across the Japanese empire to serve as sexual slaves. The system of Japanese military sexual slavery remained a taboo subject in Japanese and Korean society until the late 1980s, when protest movements began on behalf of the survivors of this system, and survivors, many of whom had lived as social outcasts, began to come forward and testify. In South Korean public discourse, the period stretching from the end of the war to the beginning of the ""comfort women grandmothers movement,"" as it came to be called, is often referred to as the era of ""silence."" But in this dissertation, based in ethnography at the House of Sharing, a rest home for survivors of Japanese military sexual slavery, I find that the women have long been giving voice to their experiences. In particular, many of these women have made recourse to Korean folk song and popular song ( teuroteu ) and international pieces to reckon with traumatic experience and traumatized sexuality and seek a sense of social connectedness without outing the public secret of Japanese military sexual slavery. I also find that song remains important now, when these women find themselves behind microphones and cameras speaking to the imagined community. South Korean social movements and public culture have made the women into symbols of the ideology of national woundedness vis-à-vis Japan that lies at the heart of South Korean nationalism. In this era of openness, the women have made use of the opacity of reference and the public privacy of song to nurture a sense of the particularity of their experiences, to continue to struggle with trauma, and to negotiate with and create alternatives to woundedness ideology. I examine the means by which women have cobbled systems for expressing and reckoning with their experiences, addressing complex systems of song appropriation, composition, and remembering. I also consider how these women's musical self-representations are received in the public sphere.* *This dissertation is a compound document (contains both a paper copy and a CD as part of the dissertation).

The central argument of this work is that the Egyptian nationalist movement was consciously inter-nationalist, in that the nationalist activists were not only seeking an end to their own colonial status, but an end to colonization as an acceptable form of political or social action. The imagining of a national identity demanded the simultaneous creation of a supra-national identity, that of ""colonial"" or ""oppressed peoples."" Therefore, the connections and cooperation that existed between Egyptian and Indian nationalists were not incidental or utilitarian, as they are portrayed in nationalist and imperial historiography if mentioned at all, but rather they were deliberate and defining parts of the nationalist programs. A secondary argument addressed here is the common misinterpretation of Indian-Egyptian interaction before and during the First World War as being ""Pan-Islamic"" and largely the result of Ottoman and German machinations. The evidence presented here does not support this but rather confirms the larger argument: that the Egyptians were primarily working for their own nation-state and allied with the Indians for mutual benefit in their individual nationalist goals. Finally, this thesis demonstrates that Egyptian nationalism incorporated a trans-nationalist element well before the Pan-Arabism and Islamic-nationalism of the 1930's. The effect of the Indian movement on Egyptians is examined in light of relationships among the leaderships, collaboration at nationalist and international conferences, and the role of Indian nationalists, particularly Gandhi, in the literature and periodical press of Egypt. The response of the British authorities to these connections is also examined discussed, both in its own capacity and in terms of its effect on the nationalists. Indeed, this work argues that efforts to ""de-link"" the nationalist movements were actually instrumental in creating solidarity between them. Thus, nationalists throughout the Empire became an ""imagined community"" through articulation their shared goal, the response of the authorities to this goal, and the common socio-political language that their efforts demanded, which was to become the standard tongue of modern anti-colonial movements.",304955642,,Dissertations & Theses," Khan, Noor-Aiman IftikharKhanIftikharNoor-AimanKhan, Noor-Aiman Iftikhar",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251833461 , 34018291 , 66569 , 9780542949838 , 3240104 , 3240104", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542949838, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304955642?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0582 History"," 0332 History , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0582 History"," 0332 History , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0582 History",," 0332 History , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0582 History"," History , Middle Eastern history"," Social sciences , Colonialism , Egyptian , India , Nationalism , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+enemy+of+my+enemy%3A+Indian+influences+on+Egyptian+nationalism%2C+1907%E2%80%931930&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khan%2C+Noor-Aiman+Iftikhar&amp;isbn=9780542949838&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Kantō resident Ainu and the urban Indigenous experience,"Today, a large proportion if not majority of the world's Indigenous peoples lives in cities or urbanized areas. Despite awareness of this fact from within the international Indigenous movement, city life is still represented as being peripheral to the authentic centre of Indigenous life 'at home'. In general, researchers have only just begun to critique this representation and attend seriously to the new forms and processes of Indigenous sociality that underpin such diasporic geographies. In this thesis, I examine the politics surrounding urban Indigenous mobility and propose an analytical approach to its study based on the concept of diaspora. I develop this diasporic framework with regard to the situation of Ainu---the Indigenous people in Japan---resident in and around the greater metropolitan region of Tokyo ( Kantō ). Serious interest in Kantō resident Ainu history has been lacking in both academic and public domains, to the extent that the array of issues affecting and reflecting their social organization have represented a highly marginal if not altogether overlooked point of interest within the general field of Ainu studies. I demonstrate that to concentrate on the diasporic history and dynamics of Ainu resident in the capital region underlines the misguided regionalization of contemporary Ainu studies and affairs to northern Japan. It also raises important questions concerning Ainu identity, self-organization and political rights that contests established ideas about Ainu culture and society. On a broader level, it provides an original example of how Indigenous people negotiate their experience of the city and together form their own places, memories and connections through social relations in and beyond the urban environment.",304956990,,Dissertations & Theses," Watson, Mark KennethWatsonKennethMarkWatson, Mark Kenneth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1150817531 , 33585981 , 66569 , 9780494140574 , NR14057 , NR14057", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780494140574, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304956990?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Ainu , Indigenous , Japan , Kanto , Urban culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Kant%C5%8D+resident+Ainu+and+the+urban+Indigenous+experience&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Watson%2C+Mark+Kenneth&amp;isbn=9780494140574&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Traversing boundaries: Chinese, Mexicans, and Chinese Mexicans in the formation of gender, race, and nation in the twentieth-century United States-Mexican borderlands","This work tracks the spatial movements of Chinese men, Mexican women, and Chinese Mexicans from Sonora, through the U.S.-Mexican Borderlands, to China, and then back to Sonora and various other parts of Mexico. Following the paths people traveled as a result of the cross-race connections they formed and the criminalization of those ties, I argue that the complex connections Chinese and Mexicans formed in Sonora and the social and geopolitical borders they crossed helped shape the culture of the U.S.-Mexican borderlands in the twentieth century. While other scholars have provided much insight into the formation of the anti-Chinese movement in Sonora and its spread to other areas of Mexico, my work focuses on relations among Chinese and Mexicans and the ways many people defied anti-Chinese logic. Utilizing a borderlands gender approach, this project adds to the literature in Borderlands, Mexican, United States, Women's, Chicano/a, and Asian American History. Chapter 1 explores the broad range of daily, neighborly, cooperative, personal, and economic connections that Chinese and Mexicans formed in Sonora during the early twentieth century. Focusing specifically on economic arrangements and romantic unions among Chinese men and Mexican women, Chapter 2 addresses the profound split between people who forged ties with Chinese and those who organized against them in the state. Chapter 3 examines the ways Chinese men and Chinese Mexican families confronted the mass expulsion of Chinese during 1931-1933, the culmination of the anti-Chinese movement. While the majority of Chinese---and often the families they had formed---left Sonora, some stayed with permission from authorities or by hiding. Chapters 4 and 5 address the experiences of Mexican women and Chinese Mexican families in China and the repatriations of the late 1930s and the early 1960s. Illuminating the little known history of Mexicans and Chinese Mexicans in China and their struggles to return to Mexico, this dissertation expands our notions of the Mexican Diaspora and the increasing presence of Mexico in the global political arena after the 1930s. Chapter 6 explores contemporary Chinese Mexican identity and the historical and cultural memory of Chinese in Sonora.",304958251,,Dissertations & Theses," Schiavone Camacho, Julia MariaSchiavone CamachoMariaJuliaSchiavone Camacho, Julia Maria",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1147181621 , 33586151 , 66569 , 9780542635649 , 3214013 , 3214013", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542635649, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304958251?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0332 History"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0332 History"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0332 History",," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0332 History"," Latin American history , American history , History"," Social sciences , Borderlands , Chinese , Chinese-Mexicans , Gender , Mexicans , Nation , Race , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Traversing+boundaries%3A++Chinese%2C+Mexicans%2C+and+Chinese+Mexicans+in+the+formation+of+gender%2C+race%2C+and+nation+in+the+twentieth-century+United+States-Mexican+borderlands&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schiavone+Camacho%2C+Julia+Maria&amp;isbn=9780542635649&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"To save the world: Humanitarianism and world culture,"Humanitarian organizations play an important, but under-analyzed role in the processes of contemporary globalization. Organizations such as Amnesty International, CARE, World Vision, Save the Children, Oxfam, and the International Rescue Committee enact world-level cultural principles that increasingly constitute and direct an array of institutional actors---from states to firms to social movements. This fact challenges both conventional macro-Sociological and International Relations accounts that typically trade in highly reductionistic understandings of culture. Building from the theoretical contributions of World Polity Institutionalism, this dissertation contends that culture is reducible neither to the functional component of political economy, nor to the conscious value-choices of rational actors, nor still to the ideology of ruling elites. Culture is conceived, rather, as a dynamic set of institutionalized rules infusing actors and their actions with meaning and value. Only in the case world culture, such meaning and value become increasingly institutionalized in similar ways around the planet. Through content analysis of key documents and source material of 65 prominent humanitarian organizations and through semi-structured, in-depth interviews with 32 humanitarian practitioners, this research analyzes the enactment of world cultural principles as accounts of reality (or ontologies), as accounts of value (or axiologies), and as accounts of obligation (or ethics). Attention to this tripartite accounting reveals the particularistic origins of world-culture and illustrates how world culture comes not only to be redacted and contested among humanitarians, but how it leads to disputes over the very meaning and practice of humanitarianism in the contemporary world. At the broadest levels, this dissertation considers in what sense we can talk meaningfully about the existence of a ""world culture."" More narrowly, it examines how humanitarian organizations enact world-cultural principles in both the most central and peripheral social spaces on the planet---how they frame problems and implement solutions---how, in other words, they decide what is worth their (and our) moral energy in a globalizing world. Humanitarian organizations, it is argued, are the principal moral arbiters of the ""good"" international society and bearers of the tacit mythic structure from which the present world order derives much of its shape and plausibility.",304960101,,Dissertations & Theses," Yates, Joshua J.YatesJ.JoshuaYates, Joshua J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1192194481 , 34557721 , 66569 , 9780542770388 , 3225932 , 3225932", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542770388, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304960101?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Globalization , Humanitarianism , International aid , Nongovernmental organizations , World culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=To+save+the+world%3A++Humanitarianism+and+world+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yates%2C+Joshua+J.&amp;isbn=9780542770388&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Activism at the grassroutes: Working for change with migrant agricultural labourers in Canada,"Over the course of the four decades that the Seasonal Agricultural Workers' Program has operated as an international labour recruitment initiative for Canadian farmers, a variety of community groups, churches, and non-profit organizations have mobilized around the causes of the Mexican and Caribbean migrant workers who call rural Canada their temporary home.

In terms of my specific positioning as a Hispanic in the U.S. Southwest, this dissertation intends to ""read-across"" journey experiences of exile and return. In terms of a reading trajectory, I first read the exile and return experiences addressed by Second Isaiah (40-55) across to the contemporary Mexican migratory experience. This reading project is theoretically grounded in a theology of the diaspora, which, according to Fernando F. Segovia, is a theology grounded and forged in the migratory experience of U.S. Hispanics. From this perspective, the Jewish Babylonian exiles and contemporary Mexican migrants are viewed as common human experiences of diaspora. Moreover, these experiences find expression in each of these groups' corresponding cultural literature. Thus, I propose to read-across this spectrum of cultural literature and compare the poetry of Second Isaiah and the Mexican immigrant corridos (ballads). In the end, this dissertation argues that the diasporic categories of exile and return in Second Isaiah can inform our reading of exile and return in the cultural literature of the Mexican immigrant and vice versa. In other words through the corridos about the Mexican immigrant experience, one is able to see that Second Isaiah is also a form of oppositional culture, serving as a sharp critique of the imperial system.",304981927,,Dissertations & Theses," Cuellar, Gregory LeeCuellarLeeGregoryCuellar, Gregory Lee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1192181121 , 33585901 , 66569 , 9780542639005 , 3214732 , 3214732", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542639005, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304981927?accountid=14496," 0321 Bible , 0312 Latin American literature"," 0321 Bible , 0312 Latin American literature"," 0321 Bible , 0312 Latin American literature",," 0321 Bible , 0312 Latin American literature"," Bible , Latin American literature"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Language, literature and linguistics , Ballads , Exile and return , Immigrant , Isaiah , Marginality , Mexican",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Voices+of+marginality%3A++Exile+and+return+in+Second+Isaiah+40%E2%80%9355%0Aand+the+Mexican+immigrant+experience&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cuellar%2C+Gregory+Lee&amp;isbn=9780542639005&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Narrativas contaminadas tres novelas latinoamericanas: “El Tungsteno”, “Parque Industrial” y “Cubagua”","This thesis examines the Latin American avant-garde movements of the 1920s and 1930s not through the usual focus, poetry, but through narrative fiction. I am working here with three 1930's novels that portray profound ideological concerns that had not often been considered in earlier Latin American avant-garde narratives. El tungsteno, by Peruvian César Vallejo, is a mining novel that includes indigenous issues. Parque industrial, by Brazilian Patrícia Galvao, is a gender-based novel with urban and proletarian themes. And Cubagua, by the Venezuelan Enrique Bernardo Núñez, is an historical novel, confronting the trauma of neo/colonization with the beginning of the populist modernization project. The beginning of the 1930s provides an important perspective from which to focus on the literary development of the continent. This is because it was not only a powerful world-changing moment but also, as I argue, an opportunity for a rupture within the institutions of literature. After the world political, social, and economic crises of 1928-1929, the Latin American avant-garde had to search for other ideological and aesthetic tactics to participate in the debates about national configurations in the international context, that reflect the emerge of definitive new social forces. My proposal is to explore the literary tensions of these Latin-American narratives, suggesting that it is possible to identify in them concerns such as the influences of mass movements within ""peripheral"" societies. I argue that despite their different responses to the literary-historical conjuncture, each of the texts chosen exhibited conflictive components which I call ""contaminatory"": that is to say, an unstable (even contradictory) mixture of political as well as literary elements from very different origins. One of the means of accomplishing this, after a review and critique of some key avant-garde concepts, is through an analysis of the relationship between Vallejo's cultural essays (including his USSR travel books) and El tungsteno. Then, in the case of Parque industrial, I evaluate the links with other Brazilian works and ""female voices"" of the time. Finally, I assess the relationships between Cubagua and some of his historical works, before summing up the different ""contaminatory"" strategies of the era in my conclusion.",305246977,,Dissertations & Theses," Bruzual, AlejandroBruzualAlejandroBruzual, Alejandro",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1292457981 , 34299831 , 66569 , 3255699 , 3255699", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, Spanish, Spanish,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305246977?accountid=14496, 0312 Latin American literature, 0312 Latin American literature, 0312 Latin American literature,, 0312 Latin American literature, Latin American literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Brazil , Cubagua , El Tungsteno , Galvao, Patricia , Nunez, Enrique Bernardo , Parque Industrial , Peru , Vallejo, Cesar , Venezuela",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Narrativas+contaminadas+tres+novelas+latinoamericanas%3A+%E2%80%9CEl+Tungsteno%E2%80%9D%2C+%E2%80%9CParque+Industrial%E2%80%9D+y+%E2%80%9CCubagua%E2%80%9D&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bruzual%2C+Alejandro&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Assessing place character in response to Wal -Mart,"Community members across U.S. municipalities grow more vocal in their concerns about how outside retail corporations shape local community life. The way these residents respond to nation-global corporations, and the way they make arguments about what it means to live in their community, is an interesting social phenomenon. By studying community response to ""big box"" retail development I answer the question: how does a geographic location become ascribed with a definition of community? Utilizing geographic theorist Krista Paulsen's place character element as an analytic tool to understand a local response to potential development of a Wal-Mart Supercenter, I examine definitions of community as they relate to issues of consumption practices and community relations. These issues were identified through various methodologies including ethnography, semi-structured interviews, historical narrative analysis and GIS (Geographic Information Systems) demographic data. Building on sociologist Thomas Gieryn's ""sociology of place"" framework, I uncovered new aspects of the socio-cultural, political and economic makeup of the communities studied. This makeup is represented in the material, social practices and symbolic characteristics by which people denote local place character. Identifying these characteristics is an important step in understanding why social movements occur where they do, the nature of the emplaced social movement activity, and what inspires community members to respond to what they perceive as an external threat. My research findings advance a place-sensitive sociology that reintroduces the role of community as a part of an individual's identity. By expanding the definition of community beyond the geographical setting, the built location and the meanings and values associated with a place can be studied as part of individual's response to social change. Additionally, my research finds that a place-sensitive sociology is also important for understanding the varied and nuanced ways that globalization impacts various scales, particularly the local. As the traditional national barriers to the global flow of people and commerce are eroded, local communities will increasingly become a focal point at which globalization can be challenged.",305247134,,Dissertations & Theses," Reinke, Dana ColleenReinkeColleenDanaReinke, Dana Colleen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1296088021 , 36222371 , 66569 , 3255743 , 3255743", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305247134?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0626 Sociology"," 0366 Geography , 0626 Sociology"," 0366 Geography , 0626 Sociology",," 0366 Geography , 0626 Sociology"," Geography , Sociology"," Social sciences , Local community , Place character , Social movements , Wal-Mart",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Assessing+place+character+in+response+to+Wal+-Mart&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reinke%2C+Dana+Colleen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The rhetoric of AIDS policy in South Africa,"This dissertation examines the rhetorical dynamics of South African AIDS policy under President Thabo Mbeki.

In defense of these policies, the President offered scientific arguments founded on the theories of Western ""AIDS dissenters."" He also made the case that South Africa's unique experiences under apartheid demanded a strong tolerance of dissent and debate. The international condemnation of these views was striking. Over the course of the controversy, rhetoric played a central role in shaping the views of both sides. Advocates marshaled public arguments in response to the exigencies of the controversy. Contextual constraints also forced the rhetors to adapt their messages. Each chapter of this dissertation examines a different rhetorical element of the controversy. They include the cultural context of South Africa's transition to democracy, the development of AIDS dissent in the Mbeki administration, the early development of AIDS dissent in the West, the technical clash of scientific arguments in Mbeki's Presidential AIDS Advisory Panel, and indigenous social movement resistance to the government's policies.",305257220,,Dissertations & Theses," Paroske, MarcusParoskeMarcusParoske, Marcus",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1179965491 , 34357741 , 66569 , 9780542748370 , 3224025 , 3224025", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542748370, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305257220?accountid=14496," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration",," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition , 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration"," Rhetoric , Composition , Public health , Public administration , Acquired immune deficiency syndrome--AIDS , Health care policy , South Africa"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , AIDS policy , Mbeki, Thabo , Rhetoric , South Africa , Thabo Mbeki",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+rhetoric+of+AIDS+policy+in+South+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paroske%2C+Marcus&amp;isbn=9780542748370&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""State, social movement and producer perspectives on multifunctional agriculture in the global food regime","Growing pressure for trade liberalization in agriculture emanating from World Trade Organization (WTO) negotiations has created a good deal of uncertainty about the future of the global agrifood regime. One expression of this uncertainty is the debate surrounding the use of the multifunctionality argument in agricultural trade negotiations. Accordingly, agriculture should be treated differently in global trade negotiations because of its unique contribution to society. This position is championed by the European Union (EU), among others, and received a mixed reaction from the United States. The scholarly debate on multifunctional agriculture has also been mixed. Some argue that the use of this concept in global trade negotiations represents a form of rearguard protectionism, while others optimistically claim that it points towards a post-productivist transition. Still others claim it serves to legitimate the liberalization process. This dissertation seeks to clarify the meaning of multifunctional agriculture as a policy concept, by focusing on the various discursive arenas where it is debated. The purpose of the study is to determine whether or not there is a hegemonic definition of the concept at the global level of governance, and how this definition is diffused to the state and local level of governance. In order to investigate this issue the public discourse on multifunctional agriculture that arose from the policy debates surrounding the Green Box subsidy category in the WTO negotiations, the Rural Development Regulation of the EU's Common Agricultural Policy and the US Farm Bill Conservation Security Program are analyzed. In depth case studies of the debate surrounding the implementation of agri-environmental programs in Ireland and Pennsylvania were also conducted. The relative hegemony of a particular interpretation of agriculture's multifunctional role was determined by the degree to which it resonated among the different socio-political actors (official, mainstream farmer, sustainable agriculture, and environmental) in a given policy arena, and with similar policy actors at different levels of governance. Based on this analysis it was concluded that the hegemonic interpretation of multifunctional agriculture at the macro-level of governance largely reflected or complemented the neoliberal agenda. However, these macro-level interpretations failed to resonate with official and social movement actors at other levels of governance, who were either ambivalent or hostile towards the liberalization project, and who tended to privilege discourses that emphasized hygienic, neo-mercantilist, and agro-ecological concerns. This suggests that the extent to which the debate on agriculture's multifunctional role reflects neoliberal, post-productivist, or protectionist concerns largely depends on the level of governance which the debate is taking place, as well as the geographical context of the debate.",305263728,,Dissertations & Theses," Lenihan, Martin H.LenihanH.MartinLenihan, Martin H.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1260801081 , 34937911 , 66569 , 3248358 , 3248358", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305263728?accountid=14496," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0700 Social structure",," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0700 Social structure"," Agricultural economics , International law , International relations , Social structure"," Social sciences , Food regime , Global trade , Multifunctional agriculture , Producer , Social movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=State%2C+social+movement+and+producer+perspectives+on+multifunctional+agriculture+in+the+global+food+regime&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lenihan%2C+Martin+H.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Slave traders and planters in the expanding *South: Entrepreneurial strategies, business networks, and western migration in the Atlantic world, 1787–1859","This study attempts to analyze the economic effects of the domestic slave trade and the slave traders on the American South in a broader Atlantic context. In so doing, it interprets the trade as a sophisticated business and traders as speculative, entrepreneurial businessmen. The majority of southern planters were involved in the slave trade and relied on it to balance their financial security. They evaluated their slaves in cash terms, and made strategic decisions regarding buying and selling their property to enhance the overall productivity of their plantations in the long run. Slave traders acquired business skills in the same manner as did merchants in other trades, utilizing new forms of financial options in order to maximize their profit and taking advantage of the market revolution in transportation and communication methods in the same ways that contemporary northern entrepreneurs did. They were capable of making rational moves according to the signals of global commodity markets and financial movements. The slave trade eventually played a central role in determining the fate of the South, as a business that created a unified South under proslavery ideology and encouraged western migration to preserve the institution of slavery. In a time of western expansion and the cotton boom, some slave traders were able to accumulate great wealth from the slave-trading business and sought opportunities to acquire higher social status and financial stability. Through the case of Rice C. Ballard, who was able to make the transition from a slave trader in Virginia to a cotton planter in the West, this dissertation will show that skills and networks established from the slave-trading business enabled the traders to acquire managerial abilities and the ethos associated with nascent global capitalism. They were able to develop awareness and knowledge of commercial networks beyond the South and operated with an expansive mindset to adapt to the increasingly integrated global economy of the early nineteenth century.",305284210,,Dissertations & Theses," Yagyu, TomokoYagyuTomokoYagyu, Tomoko",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1176537141 , 32784031 , 66569 , 9780542728778 , 3221816 , 3221816", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542728778, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305284210?accountid=14496, 0337 American history, 0337 American history, 0337 American history,, 0337 American history, American history," Social sciences , Atlantic world , Business networks , Migration , Planters , Slave traders , South",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Slave+traders+and+planters+in+the+expanding++*South%3A++Entrepreneurial+strategies%2C+business+networks%2C+and+western+migration+in+the+Atlantic+world%2C+1787%E2%80%931859&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yagyu%2C+Tomoko&amp;isbn=9780542728778&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Anglican women missionaries and the culture of spirituality in Africa, 1865–1930","This dissertation charts the formative years of Anglican women's professional missionary work in Madagascar, Uganda, and Britain. The unprecedented scale of women's involvement in British foreign missions between 1865 and 1930 grew out of organized efforts at home to professionalize female evangelism, promote white women's distinctive vocation of converting ""heathen"" women, and consolidate the religious framework of the British Empire. Yet this dissertation argues that mission work did not simply transplant metropolitan paradigms of femininity, imperialism, and Protestant Christianity onto African soil. Instead, women missionaries selectively deployed and contested European and indigenous cultural and religious practices in response to their encounters with African women. More specifically, British women formulated a spiritual dialogue with African women in order to confront the patriarchal systems of power that they perceived as governing colonial and indigenous social structures. This feminized discourse of Anglican spirituality fostered solidarity between British and African women-first in local mission communities, and eventually on a global level. In the process, women missionaries reworked their own understandings of Britishness, Christianity, and womanhood, revealing that mission Christianity was not a fixed imperial ideology but rather a dynamic and flexible system of beliefs and practices. I have organized the dissertation around three case studies from Madagascar and Uganda, which draw on extensive archival material in documenting the religious and cultural politics of mission education, female conversion, and marriage and motherhood through the institutional lens of three Anglican organizations: the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, the Church Missionary Society, and the Mothers' Union, respectively. I frame these in-depth studies with broader discussions of how the Anglican women's missionary movement interrogated the boundaries of, and intersections between, gender and imperialism in a changing international climate. By considering local African mission communities in conjunction with British and global social movements, this project shows that the mission field did not merely function as an extension of the colonial enterprise, but was instead a mutually constitutive site of gender, religious, and cultural formation with unexpected outcomes in Africa and the colonial metropole.",305293926,,Dissertations & Theses," Prevost, Elizabeth E.PrevostE.ElizabethPrevost, Elizabeth E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1126777451 , 33439281 , 66569 , 9780542621031 , 0542621037 , 3212779 , 3212779", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542621031 , 0542621037", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305293926?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0331 African history"," 0335 European history , 0331 African history"," 0335 European history , 0331 African history",," 0335 European history , 0331 African history"," European history , African history"," Social sciences , Africa , Anglican , Culture , Great Britain , Madagascar , Missionaries , Spirituality , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Anglican+women+missionaries+and+the+culture+of+spirituality%0Ain+Africa%2C+1865%E2%80%931930&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Prevost%2C+Elizabeth+E.&amp;isbn=9780542621031&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Re/presenting labor: Economic discourse, value, and ethics","This dissertation is an attempt to rethink, represent, and reclaim labor for economic and social discourse. In the first essay, I analyze contemporary renditions of labor in nonacademic economic discourses—publications of international institutions—as well as postmodernist narratives to show that labor, rather than being a given category with a single definition, acquires different meanings in different theories, with different theoretical, economic and ethical implications. As it participates in the constitution of a unique discourse that renders certain aspects of reality visible, labor becomes a “particular lens” with which one can understand, ascribe meanings to prevalent economic and social relations, and destabilize, subvert, and transform the status quo by potentiating counter-hegemonic discourses and mobilizing alternative movements. In the second essay, I argue that there is no labor in the singular in Marx’s writings by tracing the different conceptions he advances throughout his works and their affectivities. That is, the productive activity through which human beings realize their human essence, or the creator of use-values which appears as an eternal condition of human existence, does not exhaust what labor is. Marx privileges another definition of labor—the performer of surplus—with which he elaborates a unique and unprecedented class analysis. However, none of these characteristics is an immediate property, essential quality of labor in and of itself; rather, Marx ascribes these meanings to labor, thus avoiding the fetishistic inversion he persistently criticized. With this definition, and building upon Amartya Sen’s capabilities approach, I develop a labor theory of ethics in the third essay. I argue each should have the capability to perform surplus, and do so according to their ability; they also should have the capability to appropriate this surplus irrespective of their role in its production, and receive a portion of it in accordance with their needs. To the extent that no one is excluded from participating in, and there is always someone or some group who can join, this surplus economy, the communist ethics I elaborate transcends the capitalist normative framework of “equal rights and equal exchange”, replacing it with a “radical equality”.",305301980,,Dissertations & Theses," Duzenli, Faruk ErayDuzenliErayFarukDuzenli, Faruk Eray",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1472126011 , 17666161 , 66569 , 9780549436263 , 3299367 , 3299367", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780549436263, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305301980?accountid=14496," 0501 Economics , 0509 Economic history , 0510 Labor economics"," 0501 Economics , 0509 Economic history , 0510 Labor economics"," 0501 Economics , 0509 Economic history , 0510 Labor economics",," 0501 Economics , 0509 Economic history , 0510 Labor economics"," Economics , Economic history , Labor economics , Essays , Business ethics , Publications , Theory , Studies , Marxism"," Social sciences , Capabilities , Economic discourse , Ethics , Labor , Marx, Karl , Postmodernism , Value",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Re%2Fpresenting+labor%3A+Economic+discourse%2C+value%2C+and+ethics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Duzenli%2C+Faruk+Eray&amp;isbn=9780549436263&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Courage under fire: African American firefighters and the struggle for racial equality,"This dissertation examines the struggle for racial equality in urban fire departments from the late 19 th century to the present. The first half contains extensive case studies of Black experiences in the New York City Fire Department (FDNY) and Baltimore City Fire Department (BFD). Particular emphasis is given to the process of Black inclusion, day-to-day and institutional race relations, and the backgrounds and experiences of Black firefighters in each fire department. The activities of local branches of national civil rights organizations such as the National Urban League and the NAACP, as well as the involvement of local Black political leaders in the struggle for Black inclusion and equal opportunity are chronicled, as are the activities of the Vulcan Society in New York and the Social Association of Fire Fighters in Baltimore. The second half of the dissertation explores the nationalization of the struggle for equal employment opportunity within the urban fire service. The 1970 formation of the International Association of Black Professional Fire Fighters (IABPFF), its relationship to the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), and the struggle for ""community control"" and Black representation within urban fire departments as well as the impact of Title VII, the Civil Rights Movement, the Black Caucus and Black Power movements, and urban rebellions on the organization's formation and objectives are examined. The evolution, implementation, limitations, and strengths of equal opportunity litigation and remedial relief programs as applied to urban fire departments, the activities of Black firefighters' organizations, the International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF), municipal governments, the Department of Justice, and the federal courts during the course of fire department litigation are also documented and analyzed.",305302733,,Dissertations & Theses," Goldberg, David A.GoldbergA.DavidGoldberg, David A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1144186121 , 33738271 , 66569 , 9780542629747 , 3212729 , 3212729", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542629747, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305302733?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0629 Labor relations , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0629 Labor relations , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0629 Labor relations , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0629 Labor relations , 0337 American history"," Black history , Labor relations , American history"," Social sciences , African-American , Firefighters , Maryland , New York City , Racial equality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Courage+under+fire%3A++African+American+firefighters+and+the+struggle+for+racial+equality&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goldberg%2C+David+A.&amp;isbn=9780542629747&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Becoming visible: Queer in postsocialist Slovakia,"Drawing on a rich archive of print and electronic sources, in-depth interviews and participant observation in three Slovak lesbian and gay nongovernmental organizations Ganymedes, Museion and Altera, this ethnography presents a culturally and historically situated analysis of the conditions and effects of the emerging visibility of sexual minorities in post-1989 Slovakia. At the core of this study is Foucault's theorizing of sexuality as an effect of discourses, and his genealogical approach to studying the links between discursive practice and different modalities of power. Through uncovering multiple and diffuse sites where heteronormativity is challenged, this study disrupts dominant narratives of social change that efface sexual-political struggle, and situates the emerging visibility of sexual minorities in Slovakia within the larger contexts of postsocialist transformations, European integration and globalization. This dissertation examines the following questions: How can we explain the rise of visibility of sexual minorities in post-1989 Slovakia? What are the sites of heightening visibility? How do various discursive practices effect the formation of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer sexual-political subjectivities and activist networks in the context of Slovak language and culture? How do postsocialist transformation, European integration and globalization affect the ""queering"" of civil society in contemporary Slovakia? Slovak sexual minorities emerged from invisibility with the establishment of LGBT nongovernmental organizations and periodicals in a period of societal crisis triggered by the collapse of communism in 1989 and ensuing political, economic, and cultural change. During Slovakia's accession to the European Union, LGBT activism was further mobilized by access to new knowledge and resources, marginal participation in transversal decision-making, and transnational activist networking. While Slovak LGBT activists still struggle with movement participation, they continue to establish themselves as producers of counter-knowledge and as political force that can no longer be ignored. This study documents their communicative and political intervention as a record of a social movement taking shape, and as an analysis of contested sexual discourses at a key historical juncture. It aims to contribute insight and intellectual energy to future activism and to the evolution of queer culture in Slovakia.",305306745,,Dissertations & Theses," Lorencova, VieraLorencovaVieraLorencova, Viera",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1225152151 , 32570031 , 66569 , 9780542978104 , 3242364 , 3242364", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542978104, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305306745?accountid=14496," 0708 Mass media , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender"," 0708 Mass media , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender"," 0708 Mass media , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender",," 0708 Mass media , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0733 Gender"," Mass media , Cultural anthropology , Gender"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Activism , Postsocialist , Queer , Sexual minorities , Slovakia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Becoming+visible%3A+Queer+in+postsocialist+Slovakia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lorencova%2C+Viera&amp;isbn=9780542978104&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Engineering beyond politics? Professional ideology, scientific management and the evolution of Czechoslovakia, 1848–1948","This dissertation analyses the professional activities of Czech engineers and their impact on Czech society between 1848 and 1948. In the early 20 th century, a group of Czech engineers embraced scientific management and began a ""revolt"" aimed at improving their social, economic, and legal and standing in Czech society. They claimed expertise and demanded authority over the Czech national economy, culture, and the civil service. In 1920, when Czechoslovakia became independent, these Czech engineers established the Masaryk Academy of Work (MAP) and participated in several new international engineering and scientific management institutions. Domestically, MAP's professional agenda was contested by Czech intellectuals, business leaders, and other engineers. But by the 1930s, scientific management became an international and national movement for professional socioeconomic planning. The concepts, alliances and institutions that were established by MAP engineers and economists in the 1930s, subsequently laid the foundations for Czechoslovakia's postwar planning experiment in a capitalist system and even provided continuities with the country's communist experience.",305308083,,Dissertations & Theses," van Meer, Elisabethvan MeerElisabethvan Meer, Elisabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251833721 , 34554331 , 66569 , 9780542993152 , 3243384 , 3243384", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542993152, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305308083?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0585 Science history"," 0335 European history , 0585 Science history"," 0335 European history , 0585 Science history",," 0335 European history , 0585 Science history"," European history , Science history"," Social sciences , Czechoslovakia , Engineering , Professional ideology , Scientific management",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Engineering+beyond+politics%3F+Professional+ideology%2C+scientific+management+and+the+evolution+of+Czechoslovakia%2C+1848%E2%80%931948&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=van+Meer%2C+Elisabeth&amp;isbn=9780542993152&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Community health organizing and the political economy of health care in Morelos, Mexico","This dissertation analyzes the emergence of a community-based alternative health care movement in Morelos, Mexico, and its local expressions among health groups in the mestizo town of Zarragoza. Influenced by self-help approaches, cultural revitalization efforts, and the global alternative medicine movement, health groups in this study run community clinics, natural pharmacies, and health promoter training programs in order to make the health care alternatives they offer accessible and affordable to community residents. This study explores the work of three health groups in Zarragoza and examines the practices they employ in their community clinics and the discourses that their participants advocate. The study situates local health organizing efforts in the context of global and national health policies that influence paradigms governing formal health care distribution and health sector reforms in Mexico. Specifically, it explores the strategies of local health groups as a response to the government's inadequate efforts to provide ""health for all"" and to alleviate health care shortages in the face of socioeconomic challenges that many Mexicans experience. The study also examines health organizing as a response to perceived limitations of biomedicine as the population ages and the burden of chronic illnesses accelerates the deterioration of an underfunded public health system. As health care protection decreases under neoliberal state reforms, health groups advocate a new way of ""doing"" health care that emphasizes patient participation in illness prevention, health education, and the attainment of medical care outside of government health structures. This dissertation merges critical and political economy approaches in medical anthropology with actor-oriented frameworks. By considering how the agendas of health groups reflect local and global trends, the study contributes to the medical anthropology literature by furthering our understanding of the global and syncretic nature of medical pluralism. This dissertation also contributes a case study to the scarce literature on social movements in health, offering new perspectives on how communities, most specifically women, are interacting with a myriad of global and national pressures to contribute solutions to local problems concerning health care. By detailing local perspectives and grounding the project in issues of political economy, this research offers new insights into local understandings of health care that may be overlooked in government health planning and the implementation of development programs.",305308416,,Dissertations & Theses," Schneider, Suzanne D.SchneiderD.SuzanneSchneider, Suzanne D.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1232400501 , 34018131 , 66569 , 9780542909658 , 3236418 , 3236418", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542909658, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305308416?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0769 Health care"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0769 Health care"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0769 Health care",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0769 Health care"," Cultural anthropology , Health care industry , Political economy , Community health care , Alternative medicine , Social activism , Studies , Morelos Mexico"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Community health organizing , Health care , Mexico , Morelos , Political economy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Community+health+organizing+and+the+political+economy+of+health+care+in+Morelos%2C+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schneider%2C+Suzanne+D.&amp;isbn=9780542909658&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Facilitating citizenship through teaching action research: An undergraduate course as an action research intervention,"For years, psychologists have been encouraged to acknowledge the political implications of the values inherent in their work and to embrace their professional duty to be socially responsible through activism. One potential avenue for psychologists to affect social change is through teaching socially responsible courses. Despite a movement within advanced learning institutions to emphasize community service as a valuable aspect of higher education, current college students appear to be much less invested than their predecessors in the social-political process. Some suggest that this problem may be addressed by implementing more global educational interventions that result in the development of a deeper sense of citizenship in students. Such interventions aim to help students explicitly identify their values, teach students to understand the context and origins of their beliefs as well as to hold them as tentative, promote interconnectedness and cooperation, and result in changes in thinking, feeling, and action. These aims are consistent with the tenets of Experiential Personal Construct Psychology (EPCP) and Archetypal Psychology (AP), which provide the theoretical framework for the present study. In EPCP, reverence for self and other marks the pinnacle of healthy functioning, and acts of citizenship can be seen as an outgrowth of such reverence. AP, on the other hand, emphasizes connection to the realm beyond human relations as the basis for one's sense of responsibility to the community. Through its focus on appreciating the subjectivity of all beings, AP stresses the need to more deeply respect and care for the world we live in. The present study describes the process and outcomes of an undergraduate course aimed at promoting psychological and political health through a socially responsible educational intervention. Through the course, students learned about action research and eating disorders and worked in three small groups to design and implement participatory action research (PAR) projects to address problematic aspects of campus culture related to disordered eating and body image. Qualitative descriptions and evocative texts are used to present students' experiences. In addition, students' PAR projects are described.

This study investigates strategies of inclusivity in one such organization, Persatuan Gerak Badan [Body Movement Association, PGB], a school based in Bogor, Indonesia that teaches Silat Bangau Putih [White Crane Silat], a syncretic Chinese Indonesian martial art and health movement form. Indonesia has often been described as violently fractured along the lines of ethnicity, religion, and class, yet this not-for-profit organization incorporates a widely heterogeneous community that transverses religious, ethnic, and national identifications. Age and other bodily differences are recognized and accommodated, but only gender results in differential training practices and status achievement in the school. How does PGB embrace and retain its diverse membership? To investigate this issue, I conducted multi-sited field research in Java, Bali, France, and the United States from 1999 to 2001. I explored the negotiation of linguistic, ethnic, religious, class, gender, and national differences at several branches of the school. Archival and life history analysis show how the institution has been framed as Chinese, Indonesian, and transnational/transethnic in its historical discourses. In addition, White Crane Silat is understood epistemologically as a science, a system of empirical knowledge based on physical laws and a common human physiology. It is therefore discursively rendered an inclusive universal practice rather than a exclusive ethnic cultural tradition. I focus especially on the body as a site of identity formation, that is, how shared bodily practices enable the acquisition of social identities. A key problem addressed in this research centers on how nonverbal experiences and a pedagogy that disrupts intellectualization result in the production of cultural meaning and new social relations. Public performances are also critical for PGB's inclusivity. Silat demonstrations and competitions, broadcast in film and other media, strengthen PGB's place in the Indonesian national imaginary. The diversity of PGB's membership is remarkable anywhere, but especially so in Indonesia, where tensions between ethnic and religious groups are widely recognized.

This thesis examines Qutb's life, three of his major Islamic writings ( Social Justice in Islam, In the Shade of the Qur'an and Milestones ), his influence on modern Islamic fundamentalism, and his connection to some of the world's most notorious terrorists. As the paper reveals, sixty-years after his death, Qutb continues to play a powerful role in a radical movement to conduct global jihad and implement a total Islamic state. The world is presently engaged in a war against radical Islamism and terrorist tactics. Understanding Qutb's ideology and his influence is one more baby step towards understanding and defeating an enemy that seeks to harm people worldwide. *“Pious hero of Islam” taken from Richard P.

Indigenous actors have historically engaged in contentious politics with local and national powers to gain greater access to land and other material demands. However, following a National Uprising in 1990, an ""indigenous movement"" emerged that would alter politics and state-making in Ecuador. This action represented the beginning of a transformation in the political tactics of indigenous peoples to gain greater autonomy for their communities. It was the fruit of years of struggle to articulate and legitimate indigenous culture and knowledge through the reconstruction of indigenous communities and the implementation of indigenous bilingual education. While land and material demands continued to form an integral part of indigenous grievances, they were rearticulated into a politics of culture and identity. Through this ""new"" politics, activists forged an umbrella political identity based on a rearticulated notion of ""indigenousness"" as an historical condition that began with the conquest and continued through the construction of a state that wrought violence on indigenous institutions and social forms of organization. This critique against the Ecuadorian state from an ""indigenous"" perspective would broaden into a critique against the historical formation of states as part of the hegemonic capitalist system that has attempted to maintain a monopoly over culture and knowledge. My thesis is that through the process of articulating indigenous cultures and knowledge and , as such, engaging in an effort to decolonize the Western grip on knowledge, indigenous peoples have gained greater participation within the state and contributed to its transformation. This was achieved through a combination of institutional and extra-institutional strategies. The return to democracy in 1979 provided an opening for institutional change as did an international climate that was more receptive to ""diversity"". At the same time, different governments were forced to respond to the disruptive tactics employed by the movement by negotiating with its leaders. This process altered the social and political climate of the country. For example, a new political constitution that recognizes several ""collective"" rights of indigenous peoples was adopted in 1998.",305325353,,Dissertations & Theses," Heurich Casas, Tanya KarinaHeurich CasasKarinaTanyaHeurich Casas, Tanya Karina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1192196371 , 34557861 , 66569 , 9780542788376 , 3227218 , 3227218", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542788376, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305325353?accountid=14496," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science"," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science",," 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science"," Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Cultural anthropology , Political science"," Social sciences , Activism , Antiglobalization , Ecuador , Indigenous activism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Return+of+the+rainbow%3A+Indigenous+activism+in+Ecuador&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heurich+Casas%2C+Tanya+Karina&amp;isbn=9780542788376&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Making and unmaking the Korean national division: Separated families in the Cold War and post -Cold War eras,"This dissertation is an ethnographic study of the Korean national division and the subjects it produced. It analyzes how the division and its subjects have been structured by the global Cold War and, in turn, how they have been transformed in the so-called ""Post-Cold War era."" Focusing on the issues of separated families who have functioned metonymically as emblems of national division, I analyze the workings of South Korean politics based on the state of emergency it sustained and its current faltering. I argue that the category of ""separated family"" itself was a product of South Korean division politics, and that the discourse of ""separated families"" was a South Korean narrative strategy to construct anticommunist citizen-subjects so as to bolster the legitimacy of South Korean regimes in competition with North Korea. My thesis also demonstrates how two groups of separated families were differently produced through division politics. While Silhyangmin have been publicly fostered as ""enunciating subjects"" who speak for the anticommunist state, Woˇlbukcha families have been silenced as the families of ""the enemy."" My dissertation elaborates the various mechanisms through which both Silhyangmin and Woˇlbukcha families have been produced as ""division subjects"" burdened with an extreme insecurity and a self-censoring mechanism based on a binary Cold War logic. In this way, my dissertation highlights the concrete effects of the Cold War world order, in the context of local cultural forms and institutions in South Korea. My dissertation also explores the diverse effects of the Post-Cold War transformation on separated family members. It demonstrates how the issue of separated families have again been mobilized, but in a different configuration, to promote a new nation-building project in the era of ""national reconciliation"" and ""neoliberal global competition."" It examines how diverse separated family members are reinterpreting their histories and repositioning themselves at this contemporary historical juncture. By doing so, I highlight the social process of change from the perspective of these national subjects in relation to ongoing social and political transformation. I examine this transformation not as a linear movement between two exclusive states but as a reconfiguration of a social field.",305328770,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, Soo-JungLeeSoo-JungLee, Soo-Jung",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1441185171 , 34554221 , 66569 , 9780549365570 , 3292798 , 3292798", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780549365570, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305328770?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," Cultural anthropology , Families & family life , Personal relationships , Sociology"," Social sciences , Cold War , Division , Families , Korea , National division , Post-Cold War , Separated families , South Korea , State of emergency , Transformation , Unmaking",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+and+unmaking+the+Korean+national+division%3A+Separated+families+in+the+Cold+War+and+post+-Cold+War+eras&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Soo-Jung&amp;isbn=9780549365570&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Exploratory spatial data analysis for origin and destination flow data,"This dissertation presents an exploratory spatial data analysis (ESDA) for origin and destination flow data (O-D flow data). In a number of problem domains, there is an increasing interest in exploring flow data. This interest is largely as a result of the advancement of computer technology both in software and hardware and generated by the need and possibility to analyze the large amount of spatial data available. Flow data, which is defined as data that captures movement between origins and destinations, may consist of movement of message traffic over internet, freight flows, commodities moving from state to state, population migrations, international trade, patient referrals to hospital, shopping patterns, and diffusion of disease or of innovations. Looking for patterns and anomalies of these flows is an important factor in the statistical modeling of the social and economic structure of a system of regions. However, exploration and analysis of these flows (i.e., describing and visualizing their spatial distribution and association, discovering patterns of clustering, and suggesting different spatial regimes) has been hindered by a lack of appropriate tools. The focus of this dissertation lies in the research tradition of ESDA, which requires explicitly the existence of geographical attributes in the datasets, interactive visualization tools and dynamic graphics. In this study, I propose a new set of techniques for exploring O-D flow data and integrate it into an operational ESDA environment. These objectives are decomposed into the following components. First, an ESDA framework for O-D flow data is proposed by extending it from traditional ESDA frameworks. There are two important components in the framework: (1) Interactive Visualization; and (2) Data Structures. The former consists of a set of interactive visualization techniques and dynamic graphics (devices) for conducting exploration of O-D flow data. The later provides basic infrastructures for coordinating data and devices, and communicating between user-interface, data and devices (i.e., linking and brushing). Third, an easy-to-use prototype software system is implemented for the exploration and visualization of flows. Finally, the use of the 48 US state migration during 1995-200 demonstrated and tested the system and methods developed with real flow data in order to proof-of-concept result.",305330082,,Dissertations & Theses," Syabri, IbnuSyabriIbnuSyabri, Ibnu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1192182241 , 34554621 , 66569 , 9780542776434 , 3223729 , 3223729", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542776434, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305330082?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0428 Geotechnology"," 0366 Geography , 0428 Geotechnology"," 0366 Geography , 0428 Geotechnology",," 0366 Geography , 0428 Geotechnology"," Geography , Geotechnology"," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Dynamic graphics , Exploratory spatial data , Interactive visualization , Migration , Origin and destination flow",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Exploratory+spatial+data+analysis+for+origin+and+destination+flow+data&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Syabri%2C+Ibnu&amp;isbn=9780542776434&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Indian Americans as native informants: Transnationalism in Bharati Mukherjee's “Jasmine,” Jhumpa Lahiri's “The Namesake,” and Kirin Narayan's “Love, Stars and All That”","The growing interest in postcolonial cultures and literatures in recent times has moved beyond the dichotomies of colonizer-colonized or dominator-dominated. I endorse Michael Hardt and Antonio Negri's suggestions in Empire (2001), in that decolonization in the first half of the twentieth century has shifted the flow of cultural and material goods further West, to the United States. The concept of ""Empire"" is more dispersed, and therefore, the agenda is different. In this context, I examine how the post-1965 Indian immigrant community is worthy of investigation because it differs from other ethnic/immigrant groups. These new arrivals reflect a voluntary movement, and they are affluent Indians with an already elite background. I argue that immigration nowadays---this transaction between two diametrically opposed worlds---is related to transnational and economic issues, besides the usual attempts to recreate ancestral roots in a foreign space. In connection with transnationalism, particularly related to the capital and cultural flows between countries, I argue that postcolonial/ethnic writers are perceived as ""native informants,"" a concept that often emerges in literature classrooms. Students, or a western audience, seem to give ""truth-value"" to an ethnic writer's depictions. I agree with Spivak and other critics who assert that writers such as Jhumpa Lahiri, Bharati Mukherjee, or Kirin Narayan, given their emergence from affluent Indian social classes, cannot be totally accurate voices of a formerly oppressed nation by the British. This dissertation suggests that different Indian American writers offer different depictions, and if read in isolation, they offer a limited perspective to students. But they can be complementary, if their literary works are read in comparison with each other.",305333624,,Dissertations & Theses," Aubeeluck, GhaitreeAubeeluckGhaitreeAubeeluck, Ghaitree",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251816821 , 35076641 , 66569 , 3244009 , 3244009", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305333624?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Comparative literature , Literature , British and Irish literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Indian-Americans , Lahiri, Jhumpa , Mukherjee, Bharati , Narayan, Kirin , Native informants , Postcolonialism , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Indian+Americans+as+native+informants%3A+Transnationalism+in%0ABharati+Mukherjee%27s+%E2%80%9CJasmine%2C%E2%80%9D+Jhumpa+Lahiri%27s+%E2%80%9CThe+Namesake%2C%E2%80%9D+and+Kirin+Narayan%27s+%E2%80%9CLove%2C+Stars+and+All+That%E2%80%9D&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Aubeeluck%2C+Ghaitree&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Secular pilgrimages: Cultural and economic influences of the United States in Chile during the Cold War and its aftermath,"This study explores U.S. influence in Chile by following the exchanges between professionals in business management and literary intellectuals from the two countries. Both groups are considered as members of a privileged elite and their exchanges are conceptualized as alternative cosmopolitan projects that had distinct, even opposing, perspectives during the cold war. Using archival materials, speeches and writings of management associations and individual managers, as well as interviews with those involved in the exchanges, the study traces the consolidation of an international management movement led by the United States during the cold war and that movement's creation of institutional and individual allies in Chile. These exchanges encouraged the creation in Chile of a professional-managerial class and an array of institutional allies that mirrored those social changes seen first in the United States before WWII. In both the United States and Chile, the construction of this institutional model brought together actors from corporations, universities, foundations and government to manage a society oriented toward markets and consumption. Sections of the dissertation that discuss the concurrent activities of the literary intellectual community analyze fiction and essays by these writers as well as their connections with U.S. institutions. These chapters discuss the Chilean literary intellectuals' negotiation of a complicated relationship with the United States, which offered them professional opportunities but represented forces opposed to the Latin American literary intellectuals' alliance with the radical left. The analyses of the Chilean fiction pay particular attention to critical representations of the world of business and management and the United States. The study addresses the contradictions between Chilean national interests and participation in the networks that were dominated by the United States during the American century in both management and literary worlds. Later chapters describe the convergence of the management and literary worlds---or more broadly speaking the economic and cultural fields of production---in the post-cold war period. The dissertation argues that the Chilean case of U.S. influence in the second half of the twentieth century has produced a particularly pronounced version of the interpenetration of cultural and economic worlds that most theories of postmodernism have described. In addition, it argues that Chile is dislocated among its Latin American neighbors due to its especially strong orientation to the model of the United States.",305335350,,Dissertations & Theses," Finnegan, Brian JamesFinneganJamesBrianFinnegan, Brian James",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1051277371 , 32333101 , 66569 , 9780542464379 , 0542464373 , 3199911 , 3199911", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542464379 , 0542464373", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305335350?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history"," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history"," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history",," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history"," American studies , Latin American history , American history"," Social sciences , Business management , Chile , Cold War , Literary intellectuals , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Secular+pilgrimages%3A+Cultural+and+economic+influences+of+the+United+States+in+Chile+during+the+Cold+War+and+its+aftermath&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Finnegan%2C+Brian+James&amp;isbn=9780542464379&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""North of Nashville: Country music, national identity, and *class in Norway","Despite the fact that country &amp; western music is popular all over the world, there is a conspicuous lack of scholarship that examines the genre in locations outside the United States. By positioning country music as a global rather than an exclusively American genre, this dissertation seeks to understand the specific question of country &amp; western music's appeal in Norway as a way of engaging broader questions of borders and belonging in current cultural and social inquiry. As a music that explicitly dramatizes and articulates senses of belonging, as well as the loss of such belonging, country music speaks to experiences that are felt as deeply beyond U.S. borders as they are within them. Questions of belonging are particularly pressing in an age in which so much of both popular and academic globalization discourse emphasizes movement, hybridity, and flux. This study shows that country music can help us think through questions about what and where ""home"" is in a time of intricately interconnected cultural imaginaries. Based on fifteen months of fieldwork in Norway, my dissertation combines ethnography, archival research, and discourse analysis. In five chapters, I use these methodological tools to examine the history of country music in a Norwegian context; to analyze contemporary Norwegian country music festivals; to discuss questions of class in Norwegian country music discourse and practices; to juxtapose the trajectory of country music with the trajectory of another American musical import, jazz; and finally, to examine how country music circles back from Norway to the United States and is used to construct Norwegian-American ethnic identities at Norsk Høstfest, a heritage festival in North Dakota. I argue that as much as this transatlantic circulation of country music speaks to issues of movement and travel, it also speaks loudly to issues of borders and rootedness. Specifically, my study shows the persistence of musical, national, and class borders, indicating a continued need for studies that analyze how borders are configured and what kind of work they do in a time of intense border-crossing and movement.",305336032,,Dissertations & Theses," Solli, KristinSolliKristinSolli, Kristin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1268599621 , 34619961 , 66569 , 3248059 , 3248059", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305336032?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music",," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music"," American studies , Cultural anthropology , Music"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Class , Country music , Globalization , National identity , Norway",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=North+of+Nashville%3A+Country+music%2C+national+identity%2C+and++*class+in+Norway&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Solli%2C+Kristin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Transnational lives: Sierra Leonean immigrants and refugees in metropolitan New York,"This dissertation contributes to the growing understanding of transnational migration and survival of immigrants and refugees, in this case, Sierra Leoneans in metropolitan New York during the last forty years. This study critically looks at the strategies employed to survive, reproduce cultural practices and values, and possibility of returning to the home country. The theoretical framework builds on anthropology of transmigration, displacement, and identity formation. The literature contextualizes the discourse on the movements and adjustments of people from their countries of origin to their various residencies in the diaspora. Thus, this dissertation examines the personal and public challenges of Sierra Leonean immigrants and refugees and how they individually and collectively work toward defining their lives. From July 1999 through December 2001, multi-sited participant observation, interviewing, and archival research was conducted in around households, neighborhoods, restaurants, and local parks. In this study, research participants were often observed and questioned in both private and public places that capture their behavior, responses, and others perceptions of them over time and space. The memories of various research participants' personal accounts reflect their ""lived"", situational experiences, and multifaceted lives throughout their adaptation. In order to adjust, the networks of families and friends (both near and afar) are utilized to facilitate transition and long-term settlement. In this process also are the supportive systems of the host and home countries. By examining the systems of the home and host countries, I found that the binational movements of people, goods, knowledge, and communication bridge lives. The study demonstrates that research participants come to the host society with their own systems of beliefs, and over the course of time, they are influenced by the systems of the new country.

I incorporate films as well as testimonials and poetry by Mayan and Ladina women who actively participate in cultural and resistance movements in Central America, and the US, during the region's civil war and postwar periods. My dissertation rethinks and expands current literary and theoretical discussions on civil war and postwar narratives in Guatemala through an intersectional framework inclusive of gender, ethnicity and class while also attuned to movements of migration and Diaspora. In the testimonials, poetry and films I examined, Maya ideologies and cultural practices continue to coexist and interact alongside colonial legacies in Guatemala. Thus, many of the testimonials and poetry by Mayan women challenge colonial definitions of literacy and power by illustrating a multiplicity of literacy practices in contemporary political and social life. Through their textual interventions, these women actively collaborate in an internal (individual) and collective (national) process of decolonization. In doing so, they challenge attempts to construct Guatemala's pluralistic society in reductive terms by extending our notions of history, home, nation and identity.",305349088,,Dissertations & Theses," Estrada, Alicia IvonneEstradaIvonneAliciaEstrada, Alicia Ivonne",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1216724551 , 34017831 , 66569 , 9780542837135 , 3229987 , 3229987", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542837135, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305349088?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0900 Motion pictures",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0900 Motion pictures"," Latin American literature , Latin American history , Womens studies , Motion pictures"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Decolonization , Guatemalan Civil War , Ladina , Mayan , Postwar , Textual transversals , Women writers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Textual+transversals%3A+Activisms+and+decolonization+in+Guatemalan+Mayan+and+Ladina+women%27s+texts+of+the+Civil+War+and+postwar+periods&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Estrada%2C+Alicia+Ivonne&amp;isbn=9780542837135&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Bringing climate change down to earth: Science and participation in *Canadian and Australian climate change campaigns,"This dissertation examines Canadian and Australian climate change campaigns as cases of science in the public sphere. I pose three interconnected research questions. What is the role of science in climate change campaigns? How is the use of science affected by the type of campaign institution: government or non-government? How does the national policy environment, particularly Canada's ratification and Australia's rejection of the Kyoto Protocol, affect the campaigns? In both Canada and Australia, I used methods of participant observation, interviews, and document analysis to analyze the campaigns of a government office and a non-government organization. I found that campaigners use natural and social science, along with technologies of quantification, to motivate the public to take action on climate change. Their uses of science and numbers represent different ways of framing the problem they are trying to solve; they also represent different ways of configuring the public's participation in the campaigns. Furthermore, I demonstrate that campaigners' uses of science and numbers are oriented not only towards their audiences but also towards the concerns of their own organizations, their government or non-government counterparts, and their national political leaders. Finally, campaigners' epistemological, institutional, and national considerations influence how they attribute responsibility for environmental protection. I argue that campaigners operate under different models of the relationship between individuals, non-government organizations, and governments; these models of responsibility affect the form and content of public participation. This study thus emphasizes the interconnections between ways of knowing, political actions, and forms of public participation. As such, this work contributes to the literatures on public understanding of science, science and politics, social movements, and studies of national and international environmental politics.",305349701,,Dissertations & Theses," Padolsky, Miriam ElanaPadolskyElanaMiriamPadolsky, Miriam Elana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1296093271 , 34557091 , 66569 , 9780542644351 , 3214881 , 3214881", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542644351, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305349701?accountid=14496," 0585 Science history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0585 Science history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0585 Science history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0585 Science history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," Science history , Political science , Social structure"," Social sciences , Australian , Canadian , Climate change campaigns , Public sphere , Science",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bringing+climate+change+down+to+earth%3A+Science+and+participation+in++*Canadian+and+Australian+climate+change+campaigns&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Padolsky%2C+Miriam+Elana&amp;isbn=9780542644351&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Liberation journals: Twentieth-century francophone literary journals and the struggle for sovereignty,"Few would contest that the periodical Présence Africaine (1947) contributed to hastening African Independence, that Liberté (1959) played a major role in defining the terms of Québec's ""Quiet Revolution"" or that Les Temps Modernes (1945) helped to reunify liberated France, simultaneously igniting an intellectual revolution whose effects would be felt around the world. In this comparative study of French, Pan-African and Québécois literary journals, I examine the various mechanisms by which this unique medium might accomplish such extraordinary feats. How could such unassuming, thinly circulating periodicals possibly fuel and sustain massive liberation movements? And what peculiar alchemy of elements might make literary journals more successful than newspapers, novels or essays when it comes to challenging dominant social and political paradigms and effectuating major epistemological shifts? If oppressive systems such as imperialism and colonialism attempt to justify their legitimacy through narratives of cultural superiority, journals can serve as lobbies of critical opposition and cultural reaffirmation set on systematically debunking such claims. In their commitment to defending political freedoms through aesthetics, collective literary ventures such as Les Temps Modernes, Présence Africaine, and Liberté eloquently express the three principal components common to the genre I am calling ""liberation journals"": an embrace of modernity, an assertion of presence, and an unceasing quest for freedom. Expanding on Benedict Anderson's interpretation of the role of print culture in generating and sustaining national consciousness, I will examine the unique capacity of the literary journal medium to represent and embody an absent or eclipsed nation, even while forming transnational intellectual and aesthetic solidarities. As such, this study seeks to reintroduce a key element in the field of literary production, conspicuously absent from Casanova's World Republic of Letters, but without which such a constellation would be inconceivable. Drawing on Bourdieu's notion of symbolic capital, I will additionally examine the economy of literary journals as unique spaces of self-determination, proposing that journal production in a context of crisis is primarily fueled by an ethics of empathy and an economy of solidarity.",305354307,,Dissertations & Theses," Dibble-Dieng, MeadowDibble-DiengMeadowDibble-Dieng, Meadow",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1216724631 , 34935691 , 66569 , 9780542818851 , 3227819 , 3227819", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542818851, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305354307?accountid=14496," 0313 Romance literature , 0316 African literature , 0355 French Canadian literature"," 0313 Romance literature , 0316 African literature , 0355 French Canadian literature"," 0313 Romance literature , 0316 African literature , 0355 French Canadian literature",," 0313 Romance literature , 0316 African literature , 0355 French Canadian literature"," Romance literature , African literature , French Canadian literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Anticolonialism , Francophone , Liberte , Literary journals , Presence Africaine , Sovereignty , Temps Moderne",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Liberation+journals%3A+Twentieth-century+francophone+literary+journals+and+the+struggle+for+sovereignty&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dibble-Dieng%2C+Meadow&amp;isbn=9780542818851&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Modern -day griots: Imagining Africa, choreographing experience, in a West African performance in New York","This dissertation examines the production and practice of African dance performances in New York based on the music and dances from West Africa. The performances that I examine are not staged performances, rather they take place in a dance studio setting. New York has been central to the historical development of African dance outside of the continent due to trans-Atlantic ties that were established between Black American artists and political activists in America and West Africa. Since the period of intense interaction in the 1960's, African dance has become commercialized via World Music and is practiced by an eclectic population. Presently the performers who participate in these dance and musical practices include West Africans, a mix of African and Euro-Americans, and several other international groups. African dance performances serve as a mask for individuals to explore marginal forms of experience that do not conform to mainstream values surrounding aesthetics or subjectivity. West Africans take part in performances mainly for professional or economic goals but also to gain new forms of experience by re-thinking Africa in a new social context. While African dance performances have enriched the collective and individual experience of participants, the creative exchanges among them traverse diverse social movements, ideologies and artistic practices and involve a cultural protectionism of both space and experience. African dance has been produced within a dialogue and through a plurality of competing discourses that both fix and destabilize identities based on claims to authenticity. These claims have been inspired by a universal paradigm that associates both the performers and African dance with authentic or rooted cultures. The competing discourses are informed by a Black Diaspora aesthetics, a commodified version of exoticism and a quest for authenticity. Authenticity is an ambiguous term that describes both the source and a quality of personal experience that is derived by taking part in African dance performances. Performance participants describe their experiences as being pleasurable or symbolically meaningful and associate their practice with an authentic West African tradition. By highlighting the power dynamics involved in struggles over defining the aesthetic standards of African dance, the results of this research address the relations between aesthetics, cultural production and personhood in American life.",305355683,,Dissertations & Theses," Mekuria, WosenyeleshMekuriaWosenyeleshMekuria, Wosenyelesh",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1196397281 , 32566721 , 66569 , 9780542851124 , 3232034 , 3232034", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542851124, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305355683?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," Cultural anthropology , Dance"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Choreographing , Griots , New York City , Performance , West African",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Modern+-day+griots%3A+Imagining+Africa%2C+choreographing+experience%2C+in+a+West+African+performance+in+New+York&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mekuria%2C+Wosenyelesh&amp;isbn=9780542851124&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The female body in conflict. United States and European feminist performance art, 1963--1979: Carolee Schneemann, Valie Export, and Ulrike Rosenbach","This dissertation examines the work of Carolee Schneemann, Valie Export, and Ulrike Rosenbach as case studies in a cross-cultural examination of feminist performance art of the late 1960s and 1970s. It explores the second wave women's movements in the United States, Austria, and Germany to contextualize the development of each artist's work. To facilitate such an examination, selected works are analyzed in four thematic areas: personal experiences, beauty and the (nude) female body, female sexuality, and myth and ritual. These topics emerged as dominant concerns in feminist performance art in the late 1960s and 1970s. The aim of this study, then, is to understand the development of these topics in early feminist performance art, to undertake the first international study on feminist performance art, and to provide detailed analyses of selected work by three significant practitioners in this medium. Each of these artists chose the medium of performance art in which to use their own bodies to challenge patriarchal definitions of women in their respective societies. Schneemann, Export, and Rosenbach developed new visual territory in which women could address their lives, question their identities, and look to the female body for inspiration. The artists presented images of women that conflicted with social norms for women's bodies and with accepted standards of female behavior. The female body was, and continues to be, contested ground and these artists challenged traditional social, cultural, and historical assumptions about women through their work. Due to the conflicts surrounding the use of the female body in cultural production, much of the work by Schneemann, Export, and Rosenbach has been insufficiently analyzed. In the dominant discourses of post-World War Two art, this important body of work has been neglected. Moreover, essentialist labeling has minimized the scholarly attention received by feminist performance art of the 1960s and 1970s. Therefore, it is the aim of this dissertation, through the chosen examples of work by Schneemann, Export, and Rosenbach to increase the knowledge of their work, of feminist performance art, of significant themes in feminist performance, and of feminism in the United States, Austria, and Germany.",305355861,,Dissertations & Theses," Wentrack, KathleenWentrackKathleenWentrack, Kathleen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1068254611 , 32567131 , 66569 , 9780542519772 , 0542519771 , 3205456 , 3205456", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006," 9780542519772 , 0542519771", English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305355861?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," Art history , Womens studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Austria , Conflict , Export, Valie , Female body , Feminist , Germany , Performance art , Rosenbach, Ulrike , Schneemann, Carolee",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+female+body+in+conflict.++United+States+and+European+feminist+performance+art%2C+1963--1979%3A+Carolee+Schneemann%2C+Valie+Export%2C+and+Ulrike+Rosenbach&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wentrack%2C+Kathleen&amp;isbn=9780542519772&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“Nearby and Natural”: Towards a differential geography of organic farming in south-eastern Ontario,"Organic farming movements in Canada are growing rapidly and attracting increased attention from farmers, consumers, governments, and academics. Drawing on interviews with organic farmers in South-eastern Ontario, this thesis examines key discourses in the organic farming movement around naturalizing agricultural production and localizing the agricultural economy. The thesis shows that these discourses emerge as a critique of the industrialized and globalized agricultural system that predominates in Canada, and are central to farmers' efforts to regain a sense of agency in the processes of agricultural development. These discourses also challenge notions of the natural and the social, the local and the global as ontologically distinct, positing new visions, identities and responsibilities that instead frame these as interdependent and mutually constitutive realms.

The dissertation focuses on Taiwan's planning bureaucracy relative to urban issues and shows that democracy can liberate planning bureaucrats from the constraints and the domination of authoritarianism. This study demonstrates that planning bureaucrats and planning professionals in a democratic context can produce better policies that are in the public's interest. Still, in the absence of both proper democratic institutions and an activist civil society, planning bureaucrats might alienate the public from its rightful participatory role in public-policy making. This study shows that the KMT regime with its special economic structure---party-state capitalism and a favoritism-based welfare program---constrained the power of local governments and the actions of planning bureaucrats. Before the 1980s, the KMT regime used this economic structure to quickly adjust Taiwan's economic structure to the demands of a rapidly changing global market by sacrificing the quality of Taiwan's urban environments. This unique political-economic structure undermined the ability of local planning agencies and local governments, thereby triggering an urban crisis and popular unease during and after the 1980s. A democratic movement emerged and struggled to bring down the KMT authoritarian regime. In this dissertation's analysis of the KMT authoritarian regime's unique party-state capitalism and its eventual, collapse, I examine the use of two different approaches by opposition party leaders, the new emerging bourgeoisie and planning bureaucrats. One approach concerns the empowerment of local government and of the wider public. Opposition party leaders, social activists, and advocacy planners employed local government as a platform from which they might liberate and enlighten local planning officers and empower local citizens. The democratic movement coalition designed a variety of events and institutions in which local social activists, local politicians, local residents, and local planning officers could interact with one another and with outsiders in regard to local public affairs. The end result of all this activity was the establishment of a democratic institution. The other approach concerns Taiwan's adoption of a privatization policy. United in their belief that KMT party-state capitalism must disintegrate, an anti-KMT alliance emerged, consisting of liberal scholars, members of the new emerging bourgeoisie, certain technocrats, and opposition-party leaders. Applying the ideology of neo-liberalism to their evaluation of affairs and to their concrete actions, the alliance advocated the privatization policy as a means by which Taiwan might topple the KMT's authoritarian regime. One result of the policy was the enactment of a BOT project for a high-speed railroad, which in turn gave rise to a new plutocracy. In conclusion, this study shows that planning in a democratic context requires proper social and political institutions, an active civil society, and devolution to local government. Neo-liberalism might be able to defeat an authoritarian regime but can also erect obstacles to the consolidation of democracy.",305357375,,Dissertations & Theses," Tung, Chien-hungTungChien-hungTung, Chien-hung",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251833411 , 32405921 , 66569 , 9780542917288 , 3237339 , 3237339", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006, 9780542917288, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305357375?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0332 History , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0332 History , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development",," 0332 History , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," History , Urban planning , Area planning & development"," Social sciences , Bureaucrats , China , Democratization , Planning , Privatization , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Planning+in+a+democratized+domain%3A+Democratization+and+planning+bureaucrats+in+Taiwan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tung%2C+Chien-hung&amp;isbn=9780542917288&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Policing citizenship: Regulating immigrants through rights and crime at the United States-Mexico border,"This dissertation investigates how states regulate international migration through boundary policing. It asks why there has been an expansion of rights for immigrants alongside a simultaneous incorporation of criminal procedure within contemporary immigration enforcement. Part I is based on a historical comparison of U.S./Mexico border policing that uncovers two different approaches to regulating Mexican migration over time. The early 20 th century U.S./Mexico border apparatus regulated the movement of labor migrants through territorial closure (i.e. controlling exit and entry). In the post-civil rights period, the border apparatus regulates the membership of immigrants through intersecting frameworks of rights and crime. Part II is based on an ethnographic comparison of contemporary border policing practices in Southern Arizona and West Texas that illustrates two articulations of the intersection between rights and crime. In Arizona, criminal frameworks prevail over rights, whereas in Texas, rights dominate over crime and serve to check the criminalizing practices within immigration enforcement. How can we understand a paradoxical convergence between criminalization and rights, particularly within the U.S.-Mexico border apparatus? This dissertation argues that the convergence between the extension of rights and the incorporation of criminal procedures within immigration enforcement occurred within a post-civil rights context. The formal recognition of rights for migrants in the post-civil rights era led to a greater intersection between immigration and crime control. Criminalization presupposes rights. The 4 th and 5 th amendments, and due process rights are integral to criminal procedure. As these rights were extended to migrants, immigration enforcement came to resemble criminal enforcement. Criminal classifications, discourses and procedures are powerful and effective ways to regulate the social distribution of rights. Thus, the logic underlying the interplay between rights and criminalization is less about restricting movement and ultimately about policing citizenship and membership within a post-civil rights context.",305364612,,Dissertations & Theses," Macias, PatrisiaMaciasPatrisiaMacias, Patrisia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1288656271 , 34939491 , 66569 , 3253972 , 3253972", Dissertation/Thesis, 2006,, English, English,,2006,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2006,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305364612?accountid=14496," 0617 Public administration , 0626 Sociology , 0627 Criminology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," 0617 Public administration , 0626 Sociology , 0627 Criminology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," 0617 Public administration , 0626 Sociology , 0627 Criminology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0737 Hispanic Americans",," 0617 Public administration , 0626 Sociology , 0627 Criminology , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," Public administration , Sociology , Criminology , Minority & ethnic groups , Hispanic Americans"," Social sciences , Border , Citizenship , Crime , Human rights , Immigrants , Mexico , Policing , United States-Mexico",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Policing+citizenship%3A++Regulating+immigrants+through+rights+and+crime+at+the+United+States-Mexico+border&amp;issn=&amp;date=2006-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Macias%2C+Patrisia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Transforming selves and society: Women, spiritual health and pluralism in post -Soviet Moscow","Research into the lives of New Age women in contemporary Moscow offers a view of the social practices of the post-Soviet world that contradicts western preconceptions of Russia as ever leaning toward authoritarianism and offers a look at a movement working towards pluralism and tolerance that blends liberal individualist notions of freedom with collectivist ideals of social responsibility and justice. Following women on their individual paths to self-discovery, transformation and empowerment, we discover that their journeys are marked by active attempts to improve lives---their own, their families', and the broader world around them. In these attempts we see a unification of the values of individual freedom and social responsibility---civil and social rights. The New Age community in Moscow expresses a human rights agenda, opening up the possibility of uniting multiple spheres and revealing the common ground shared by a plurality of voices at the local and global levels. Blending traditions of Russian mysticism, Soviet social values and pragmatic attitudes, New Age women have developed a unique strain of individualism tempered by a concern for collective well-being. Their lives counter prevailing stereotypes and serve as a case study in the distorting influences of hegemonic discourses that pit East against West and intensify polarizations and extremist positions in both Russia and the West.

The main part of Plekhanov's view on Marxism :what is Marxism and how to deal with the Marxism. In addition, I think Plekhanov's view on Marxism, it also includes Plekhanov's general view on Marxist philosophy, Marxist political economics, scientific socialism . Both in theory and in practice, Plekhanov upholded and developed Marxism. In practice ,he also committed a lot of mistakes. Nevertheless, Plekhanov still can be said to be an important figure in the history of the development of Marxism. Today, we study Plekhanov's view on Marxism not only has far-reaching historical significance,but with a strong practical significance. In formation of Plekhanov's view on Marxism without objective and subjective conditions have a common role. The historical trend of development of world capitalism, the initial development of capitalism in Russia; The rise of international labor movement, the development of Russian labor movement; The democratic revolution thinking in Russia. These objective conditions provided an objective possibility for the formtion of Plekhanov's view on Marxism. Plekhanov had an aptitude for Marxism: when he was young he developed good habits and acquired more flexible way and laid a solid theoretical foundation of the culture;the minds of love people and high degree of revolutionary consciousness; Reading Marx and Engels' works; indomitable spirit, the spirit of diligent study. The process of Plekhanov's view on Marxism has its own characteristics, through the period of formation ,the period of brilliant development and the period of reversion. what is Marxism, Plekhanov pointed out: Marxism was a social political theory ,was a purely scientific theory; the feature of Marxism was practical, revolutionary and scientific; Marxist theory is the formation of a common objective and subjective conditions for the product. It is also a specific historical process. Marxist theory is an organic system; It has a directive function for proletarian revolutionary movement and the sciences; Marxism would be realized this was the fate of Marxism. Plekhanov thought the approach to deal with the Marxist : correct understanding of Marxism; the theory of Marxism associated with the actual situation; defending and spreading Marxism; upholding and developing Marxism; to be real marxist. Moreover, Plekhanov pointed out Marxist philosophy was Dialectical Materialism , Marxist political economy revealed Bourgeois exploitation of the proletariat and scientific socialism was Communist theory. Plekhanov's view on Marxism had realistic significance and far-reaching historical significance. From the view of historical significance: First, it inheriting Marx and Engels' view on Marxism , enriching and developing Marxism, putting a great impact on Lenin's view on marxism; It was important for Plekhanov to make a great contribution to Marxism; there were also important practical significance for the Russian communist movement and the international communist movement.From the view of modern value:it was important for contemporary Marxist communists to establish and adhere to the scientific concept of Marxism;it was also important for us to uphold and develop Marxism, push forward socialism in practice; Under the new historical conditions it provided important thinking information for us to do reaearsh on Marxism and establish a Marxist subject.",1026760552, 普列汉诺夫的马克思主义观研究,Dissertations & Theses," Guo, PengGuoPengGuo, Peng郭鹏",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2713834241 , 70569702 , 189128 , H278593 , H278593", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, Chinese, Chinese, 普列汉诺夫的马克思主义观研究,2007,PQDT - Global,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026760552?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIH278593 , Social sciences , 普列汉诺夫 , 马克思主义 , 马克思主义观",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+about+Plekhanov%27s+View+on+Marxism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Guo%2C+Peng&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Research on Relationship Between Private Rights And Public Rights In system transition of intellectual property rights,"The intellectual property rights nature is the most basic question of intellectual property rights system, it is the basic structure and cornerstone of intellectual property rights law system-The TRIPS agreement comes straight to the point that ""the intellectual property rights are the private power"", this localization of private power nature, causes the intellectual property rights to find in the civil right system to depend on and can further its development- Current research of academic circles to intellectual property rights nature, also basically pauses in the TRIPS agreement stipulation frame and so on- But, through the inspection of realistic society's, it is not difficult to discover that, in recent years several countries which have the compared successful system movement of intellectual property rights, all strengthened the government function intervention without one exception- The developed country with the aid of government's strength, vigorously carries out their intellectual property rights strategy in the global scope, thus they also obtained the great market monopoly status-But some developing nations are insufficient to the understanding of government function, when faces the aggressive intellectual property rights offensive of the developed country, government often appears somewhat helplessly in itself-Regarding this, the question which pondered us is: The movements of intellectual property rights whether needs the involvement of government function, how should government's regulations accurately locate, how to coordinate relationship between the private power protection and pulic regulations?

Ecocriticism is a ""green"" critical current emerging in the literary field out of the worsening global ecological crisis, under the influence of the upsurge of environmental preservation movements. It is the study of the relationship between literature, nature and culture. By mirroring culture and human civilization from the perspective of literary criticism, and exposing, deconstructing, and subverting the ideological source of ecological crisis-anthropocentrism, ecocriticism aims to establish a new ecological outlook, and realize the harmonious development between nature and human. Interdisciplinarity, broadness, openness, and complexity are the basic features of ecocriticism. Showing solicitude and concern not only for nature but also over human society, ecocriticism criticizes the misconception of the omnipotence of science and technology and the ""exalted"" status of economic growth, and advocates the balanced and harmonious development between society, civilization, and nature. Possessing unique aesthetic tastes, being a discipline about humanity, literature has its unique and effective social function; as a matter of course, literary studies should not only touch upon but also probe into human's spirit and soul. Therefore, ecocriticism should advocate returning not only to the physical nature but also to the original nature of humanity, criticize the life outlook dominated by the swelling avarice for materialism, and promote the harmony between people's physical and spiritual life. The virtuous interaction between spiritual and natural ecology is the eco-topia advocated by ecocriticism. Since the 1960s, with the worsening of the ecological crisis and the surge of the worldwide environmental concern, American academic circles have started a new upsurge in Thoreau studies, and the ""green Thoreau"" image has gradually revived. Today Thoreau has been almost universally acknowledged as America's best and most influential nature writer as well as the first American environmentalist saint. The turn of the new century saw new aspects in Thoreau studies, and a group of monographs on Thoreau's outlook on nature have been published. Based on review and analysis of Thoreau studies from the perspective of nature and ecology both at home and abroad, this dissertation argues that, Thoreau is a writer and philosopher with rich ecological ideas, who reflects natural ecology, shows concern over social ecology, emphasizes the cultivation of people's spiritual ecology, and maintains the virtuous interaction between spiritual and natural ecology. In terms of research methodology, the dissertation mainly adopts the critical strategy of deconstructionism-its subverting and dismantling power over center and authority, and New Criticism-its effective close-reading technique as its major method of investigation to explore and interpret the ecological implications embodied in Thoreau's works A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers, Walden, The Maine Woods, Cape Cod, Civil Disobedience, Slavery in Massachusetts, Life without Principle, A Plea for Captain John Brown, Martyrdom of John Brown, The Last Days of John Brown, Natural History of Massachusetts, A Winter Walk, Walking, The Selected Journals of Henry David Thoreau. Besides, it also draws on such critical approaches as biographical criticism, psychological criticism, Foucault's theory of power and discourse to investigate and expound the origin and contents of Thoreau's ecological ideas. This dissertation believes that the origin of Thoreau's ecological ideas lies in the following five aspects. First, the natural environment in the habitat of Thoreau's hometown Concord, and his parents' nature education on him have fostered Thoreau's permanent and intoxicant love for the natural world; secondly, the radical tradition and rebelling consciousness of Concord, together with the American values of the cult of freedom, equality, democracy, and individuality, have produced important effect on Thoreau's concern over social ecology; thirdly, American transcendentalism, which attaches great importance to spirits, advocates going back to nature, and seeking knowledge, truth, wisdom, and spiritual perfection by means of returning to nature, has exerted significant influence upon Thoreau's thinking on natural and spiritual ecology; fourthly, American Indian culture, which regards the earth as the Mother Creator of all entities in the world, maintains that everything on earth is alive and sacred and has intrinsic value, believes holism and the interrelatedness and interdependence among all living things, and opposes the Cartesian Dualism that cuts human from the natural world, is another important source of Thoreau's ecological ideas; and fifthly, Thoreau has been intoxicated with Oriental culture all his life. The nature outlook regarding man as an integral part of nature, the emphasis on the wholeness of human's spirits, self-culture, and harmony between nature and man advocated by Chinese culture, the ""poor-yet-cheerful"" attitude towards life, and the social outlook featured by the realization of order through the individual's introspection and spiritual attainment held by Confucianism, have influenced Thoreau's thinking on natural, social, and spiritual ecology. The Indian culture, which believes animism, the equality among all creatures, devaluates material aspiration and evaluates spiritual pursuit, and advocates returning to nature, has also affected Thoreau's ecological ideas. The above five factors, independent as well as interrelated, have altogether contributed to the formation of Thoreau's unique, multifaceted, complex, and rich ecological ideas on natural, social, and spiritual ecology. In terms of natural ecology, by presenting nature's inherent value and depicting nature's multiplicity and subjectivity, Thoreau criticizes the anthropocentric world outlook, and subverts the dichotomy between man and nature. Re-constructing the relationship between nature and human, Thoreau puts forward his thinking on natural ecology that nature is the mother of humanity, human is a part of nature, and that man and nature should keep harmonious interactions with each other. With regard to social ecology, Thoreau severely attacks the hierarchical domination of human society-the slavery system, expresses his strong opposition to war-the catastrophic threat to the ecosphere, and criticizes the limits of the scientific method and technocracy. By criticizing the negative effect of industrialization, and holding that civilization is certainly rooted in nature, Thoreau subverts the dichotomy between civilization and nature, and puts forward his thinking on social ecology that society and civilization should keep balanced development with nature. In respect of spiritual ecology, Thoreau criticizes the shriveling of people's spirits stemming from their life outlook dominated by swelling avarice for materialism such as their ""reification"" and alienation, the loss of virtue, ability to judge things, and sense of justice. He advocates reducing human's material necessities to the lowest level and emphasizes the cultivation of people's spiritual ecology, attempting to redress people's misconception featured by evaluating matter and devaluating spirits, so as to achieve the harmony between people's physical and spiritual life. Moreover, Thoreau advocates the virtuous interaction between spiritual and natural ecology, which just accords with the eco-topia advocated by ecocriticism. This notion provides ecocriticism with beneficial inspiration, and proves the precedence of Thoreau's ecological ideas. Thoreau is not only a great nature writer, but also a philosopher who shows solicitude for social ecology and the cultivation of spiritual ecology. His thinking on natural, social, and spiritual ecology is, in the final analysis, a kind of life style filled with ecological wisdom, ""poetic dwelling"", in Martin Heidegger's words. According to Martin Heidegger, ""dwelling"" is both the way in which human lives on earth and the true and ultimate objective of his life. Being the true end of man's existence on earth, ""poetic dwelling"" possesses three layers of connotation: ""freedom"", ""preservation"", and ""harmony"". Thoreau's ecological ideas on natural, social, and spiritual ecology, concerning respectively the harmony between nature and man, nature and civilization, and man's physical and spiritual life, are both independent and interconnected, with the harmony between nature and man being the ultimate end, and that between man's physical and spiritual life being the key. To achieve the harmony between nature and man, civilization and nature, first and foremost, it is necessary to cultivate people's spiritual ecology, to restore the balance between their physical and spiritual life, and to cure people of their spiritual diseases. Only in this way, can people's physical and spiritual life keep in harmony, society and civilization keep balanced development with nature, the anthropocentric world outlook be perished, and the ecological crisis be eventually settled. Thoreau's reputation has not only gone beyond literary circles, but also transcended his time and country.

This comparative thesis examines the organizational ideology and activity of the associations founded by the birth control pioneers, Marie Stopes, and Margaret Sanger. In considering the ideological constructions of contemporaneous motherhood advanced by the two groups, I seek to reposition the Anglo-American birth control movements within the wider field of social reform. Examining the influences of maternalist politics, the eugenics crusade, the developing field of social work, and the medical hierarchy in shaping the visions of maternity employed in birth control discourse, the study considers both the contrasting and convergent interpretations utilized by the organizations in their campaigns for contraception. This thesis also explores the practical work of the organizations during the interwar decades, analysing the policies and internal politics of the two groups, coalitions with other reform groups, their respective roles within the wider national and international birth control movements, and the effects engendered by the move from lay activism to professionalism. The clinical networks established by both associations are also examined, considering the divergences and similarities in the models of clinic provision, the roles of medical providers, and results of birth control in practice. I contend that, in both their ideological interpretations, alliances, and practical endeavours, the two associations shared a common vision of transitioning clinical contraception from the radical associations of the past, towards a new respectability as a legitimate medical technique and form of social welfare provision.",1221965258,,Dissertations & Theses," Walker, Caroline E.L.WalkerE.L.CarolineWalker, Caroline E.L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2832360031 , 74045062 , 101309 , U578636 , U578636", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1221965258?accountid=14496, 0585 Science history, 0585 Science history, 0585 Science history,, 0585 Science history, Science history," 486104 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+birth+control+respectable%3A+The+Society+for+Constructive+Birth+Control+and+racial+progress%2C+and+the+American+Birth+Control+League%2C+in+comparative+perspective%2C+1921-1938&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Walker%2C+Caroline+E.L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Scaled definition of suburban centrality absorption as a measure of centrality,"This thesis explores to what extent is it accurate to describe Greater London's suburban town centres as multi-scaled environments and what does this mean in terms of the kind of social entity a suburb is. It revises the socio-spatial phenomenon of 'scaled centralities' within larger entities of a city through the study of twenty suburban town centres in the city of London. Three main ideas are tested: 1) that suburban centrality is not a static condition, but rather a process with dynamic stages and states, 2) that the hierarchy of the suburban elements within the cases is related to these stages, and 3) that the distribution of town centre activity is also related to the scalar process of suburban centrality. The relationship between spatial morphology and socio-economic functioning is explored. On the one hand town centres have changed in size over time, but they also have shifted their activities and diversity. On the other hand, London has been described as a city of absorbed villages. This study suggests that the degree of absorption of each case within the whole of London has to due with socio economic differences and hierarchies. The notion of scale is explored establishing linkages between morphological patterns and socio-economic functioning. How different scales of movement can shape socio-economic functioning, and whether there is any morphological and configurational explanation of socio-economic suburban town centre's differences are also considered. This study answer some of these questions using various of the space syntax tools. A taxonomy of these elusive cases is attempted: two different categorisations are proposed as patterns of spatio-functional relations. Three morphological types are identified (concentrated, linear and expanded), and three models extracted from movement potential (local-global, balanced, and global-local) that act as descriptions of stages within the process of suburban centrality. Morphologically, the scaled definition of centrality is a function of the degree of absorption of each town centre into the whole of the spatial system. Configurationally, balanced cases that overlay different scales of movement, correspond to town centre diversity, referred in this thesis as a signalling of suburban buzz.",1430503212,,Dissertations & Theses," Forster, Alejandra CeledonForsterCeledonAlejandraForster, Alejandra Celedon",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3064579531 , 81254562 , 189128 , 9781303409516 , U594000 , U594000", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9781303409516, English, English,,2007,PQDT - Global,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1430503212?accountid=14496, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning,, 0999 Urban planning, Urban planning," (UMI)AAIU594000 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Scaled+definition+of+suburban+centrality+absorption+as+a+measure+of+centrality&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Forster%2C+Alejandra+Celedon&amp;isbn=9781303409516&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Memories and the exigencies of national interest: An analysis of post Cold War Sino-Japanese and Sino-Russian strategic relations and perceptions,"The primary focus of this dissertation is to examine how social memories of major historical conflicts and confrontations affect the mutual strategic perceptions and the corresponding bilateral relations between China and her two closest neighbours - Japan and Russia. Despite the end of the Cold War and the demise of the Soviet threat, Japan has not moved away from the United States strategically in order to balance US hegemony in the Asia Pacific. Japan instead chose to reaffirm the US-Japan security alliance in order to balance against a perceived rising China. At the same time, Russia rather than forging a closer relationship with the United States as predicted, instead sought to form a ""strategic partnership"" with China to counter US hegemony. While structural realists tell us that these could be explained as strategic balancing acts of states (against hegemony or threat), structural realism does not tell us when states choose to balance against threats and when states choose to balance against hegemony. The theoretical lens of economic interdependency does not quite adequately accounts for the behavior of these states in the post Cold War era either. Russia and China befuddle economic interdependency theorists with their warm political ties and low key economic relations, as do China and Japan with their vibrant economic relations but appallingly estranged political relationship. Various studies have pointed to the ""history"" factor as being responsible for this state of affair, but given that both Japan and Russia have pursued imperialistic policies towards China in the past hundred years, why should the PRC have so much antagonism with Japan but paradoxically enjoy close ties with Russia. The thesis therefore attempts to answer the theoretical puzzle posed by this abnormal state of affairs in post Cold War Asia-Pacific International Relations. The basic research question therefore asks if states are capable of bearing ""grudges"", and if so, why and how does this affect their foreign and security policy. In other words, what impact do memories of past conflicts or antagonism have for the behaviour of states. Drawing from the Constructivist literature, the thesis attempts to fill a theoretical lacuna posited by this empirical puzzle. The thesis weld the notion of social memories to Constructivism and in doing so, reflect how this approach can help examine the strategic movements of China, Japan and Russia in post Cold War Asia-Pacific, which economic interdependency and structural realism cannot adequately explain. The thesis argues that it is important to understand national interests in the ideational sense as much as it is to understand it in the material sense (as advocated by structural realism). Therefore, defending elements of a country's national identity (e.g. saying that a ""correct"" vision of history should be adopted) would be as equally important as defending a country's material interests. The thesis argues for the importance of social memories as a crucial element behind the change and continuity in each country's national identities. Without understanding the social memories in each country, one would not be able to comprehend the changes behind the national identities espoused by these states and their evolving definition of national interests (hence perception of various issues). At the same time, since constructivism emphasises the dialectical interactions between agency and structure, social memories are therefore not just important for the constitution of a state's identity and interests but also provide a social structure that shapes the state's foreign policy and bilateral relations. By advancing the notion of social memories to understand the research problematic, the thesis shows that it is possible for the ""grudge"" to build up and persist well beyond the conclusion of a conflict or confrontation. The genesis of this ""grudge"" therefore depends on the level of reconciliation and subsequent interactions and discourse relating to the conflict or confrontation. All these interactions are remembered and deposited into the social memory of the country which subsequently influences the definition of national identity, national interests and nationalism. The thesis maintains that in the Sino-Japanese case, there is actually very little reconciliation, and even if diplomatic gestures are made at the governmental level, it does not have the ""trickle down"" effect on the Chinese and Japanese nations respectively. In doing so, the thesis demonstrates that social memories are intricately linked to a very divergent evolution of national identities and mutual negative images in post-Cold War Japan and China.

Its modern version has focused on the role of agriculture in economic development in the 1960s and 1970s, and has then moved on to local livelihoods and micro-economics in the 1980s. Recently, a new debate has emerged between the 'neo-populists' and the 'agro-pessimists' on the role of small-scale farms in economic development and poverty alleviation. This thesis develops a framework, which helps analysis of the process of rural transformation in the age of globalization. Testing the hypothesis in Turkey illustrates a common dilemma faced by many developing countries where the role of agriculture in economic development has been diminishing without leading to a substantial movement of labour out of agriculture. Since this trend is accompanied by a stagnant agricultural economy failing to integrate into global markets, millions of small farmers have been left out of the process of economic development over the last 25 years. This thesis analyzes longitudinal village studies from three different regions of Turkey. The first case exemplifies the damaging impact of the trade distorting policies of developed countries on small-scale cotton producers in developing countries. The second case illustrates the crucial role that non-agricultural activities play in rural economies, especially in unfavourable agro-ecologies. The third shows that inequality arising from social and political factors hinders the efficient allocation of resources, constituting a big obstacle for rural development. Hence, combining assessment of the processes of agricultural and labour transition at the country level with thematic case studies, the thesis argues that the overall state of small-scale agriculture has generally been pessimistic over the last 25 years. Nevertheless, if facilitated by a new institutional framework, such as the new social democracy, designed to take advantage of new opportunities arising from globalization, a realistic policy approach would provide an optimistic prospect for future progress in rural transformation.",1625988207,,Dissertations & Theses," Karapinar, BarisKarapinarBarisKarapinar, Baris",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3500880651 , 91871992 , 189128 , 9781321354812 , U615898 , U615898", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9781321354812, English, English,,2007,PQDT - Global,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1625988207?accountid=14496," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure",," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0700 Social structure"," Agricultural economics , Social structure"," (UMI)AAIU615898 , Social sciences , Rural communities , Small farms , Turkey",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rural+transformation+in+the+age+of+globalization%3A+Small+farms+in+Turkey+1980-2007&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Karapinar%2C+Baris&amp;isbn=9781321354812&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The european social forum and the internet: a case study of communication networks and collective action,"Distinguished by its transnational scale, non-hierarchical organizing, and diverse composition, the 'movement for alternative globalization' is thought to partly derive this combination of characteristics from its use of the internet. My research is an attempt to explore this relationship by investigating the use of email lists for the preparation of the European Social Forum (ESF) in London in October 2004, one of the largest gatherings of the movement in Europe. Focusing on the processes of organizing, decision-making and collective identity formation, my study employed a combination of methods, including a preliminary survey, in-depth interviews, as. well as content analysis of the main ESF email lists. In terms of organizing, my thesis revealed that email lists are instrumental in constructing a flexible and polycentric organizing structure. They were also used extensively to widen up participation to the face-to-face organizing meetings, but also to legitimate the decision-making system and conceal its asymmetries of power. Furthermore, every list constituted a different 'site of identization' whose affordances for identity construction depended on its size, scale, and composition. In that respect, email lists constituted an infrastructure for the development of multiple identities within the movement. However, the lack of physical proximity and the limited capacity for conveying emotive content constrained the potential of email lists to foster relationships of trust and shared opinions which were instead facilitated by face-to-face communication. Overall, my thesis has identified a series of mechanisms and dynamics whose point of equilibrium determines the state of the movement at any point in time. In that respect, email and email lists tend to foster opening, divergence, multiplicity, and individuality, while face-to-face communication tends to generate closing, convergence, unity, and collectiveness. It is therefore the combination of these two forms of communication that helps the movement to have seemingly contrasting characteristics: to be united in difference or to be a collective that affirms individual subjectivity. However, my study has further shown that the capacity of the internet to foster such dynamics also depends on the specific cultures of organizing, political priorities, and ideological backgrounds of the people using it.",1771541867,,Dissertations & Theses," Kavada, AnastasiaKavadaAnastasiaKavada, Anastasia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3974950611 , 102726522 , 101309 , U233214 , U233214 , http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/8550/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1771541867?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://westminsterresearch.wmin.ac.uk/8550/ , DXN113334 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+european+social+forum+and+the+internet%3A+a+case+study+of+communication+networks+and+collective+action&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kavada%2C+Anastasia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Modelling economic effects of international retirement migration within the european union,"International retirement migration (IRM) is a growing and significant feature of the European Union.

Using overlapping generations models and simulation techniques this thesis focuses on the economic effects of International Retirement Migration (IRM) within the European Union (EU). Three main parts make up this thesis. The first part summaries the legal and the social framework within the European Union where IRM takes place. Access to European welfare system is based on the principle of non-discrimination. However, the European Comunity law regulates the possibility of free riding through the resource requirement. In the second part, after a brief literature review in social security, the thesis develops a quantitative model that tries to explain some reasons why IRM may take place. Starting with a difference between ""environment"" of European countries, some people may opt for a better life in another country when they retire. We also focus on the capital accumulation effect for home and host countries. The presence of large populations of retired foreign residents in European countries raises fundamental questions with respect to the right of access to health and welfare services. In the third part, bearing in mind the principle of free movement of capital and the non-discrimination principle in accessing public service within the EU, we focus on the economic effects of IRM for the host country, for the individual migrants themselves, for the host communities and for public policy.",1779976153,,Dissertations & Theses," Moro, DomenicoMoroDomenicoMoro, Domenico",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017662721 , 103122172 , 101309 , 10051264 , 10051264 , http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2584/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779976153?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/2584/ , (UMI)AAI10051264 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Modelling+economic+effects+of+international+retirement+migration+within+the+european+union&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moro%2C+Domenico&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"In good company an ethnography of corporate social responsibility,"This thesis is concerned with the discourse and practice of corporate social responsibility (CSR). Through a multi-sited ethnography of the world's third biggest mining company (Anglo American PIc) the thesis traces the trans-local aspects of a transnational mining corporation in pursuit of the slippety notion of CSR- a movement devoted to harnessing the g/cl;d reach and resources of 1NCs in the service of kx:al development and social improvement. The ethnography tracks these processes across a geographically diverse set of sites, from the corporate boardrooms of the companys headquarters, and the broader 'global' arenas of CSR in which the company is engaged, in London; to their headquaners in Johannesburg and those of their subsidiaty (Anglo Platinum); and ultimately to the toWIl of Rustenburg, the urban hub of South Africa's platinum belt. As such, the company provides a lens through which to reflect on the wider global CSR movement. The aims of this thesis are twofold. Firstly, the goal of this research is to contribute an understanding of the way in which c01porations, as architects and agents of development, generate new kinds of relationships between the private sector, the state and civil society. In bringing ethnographic approaches to bear on corporate capitalism, I examine haw power is accumulated and exercised in ethical regimes such as 'corporate responsibilitY, and in the discursive practices to which they give rise. The ethnographic study of CSR aims to shed light on these new regimes of authority and the ways in which they are authenticated and naturalised through the appeal to a moral discourse of responsibility. In so doing, this research aims, secondly, to advance anthropological debates on the relationship between, on the one hand the s.upposed amorality of 'the Market' and, on the other, the discourse of morality.",1810143862,,Dissertations & Theses," Rajak, DinahRajakDinahRajak, Dinah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4141932201 , 45172801 , 101309 , U239347 , U239347", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1810143862?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," DXN119202 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=In+good+company+an+ethnography+of+corporate+social+responsibility&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rajak%2C+Dinah&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Connections at Cape Verde: Postcolonial globalisation through the Internet,"This thesis examines how a particular technology, the Internet, is entangled with globalisation and postcolonial phenomena in the specific case of Cape Verde (a group of islands in West Africa). Globalisation and postcolonialism are here examined as historical macro-processes. The diesis links these macro-processes with the micro-practices of everyday life in relation to die production, circulation and consumption of the Internet. Drawing on ethnographic data collected in three different locations (in Cape Verde and among diasporic groups in the United States and Portugal), it inspects the materiality of postcolonial relationships as they are played out through and alongside the Internet from the Cape Verdean standpoint. One of the most prominent ideas about the Internet is that it allows unprecedented connectivity. This thesis argues that connectivity has a history and particular dynamics of spatialisation. Both history and spatialisation always entail power relations and exchanges built through thick layers of time and various social and political arrangements. In Cape Verde, the Internet as a communication and information technology draws upon die infrastructures of previous colonial arrangements (structural communications layouts, dynamics of ownership, the making of the state and of professional group identities, racial and class relations) together with die links and routes that have followed (Cape Verdean contact, movement and exchange, namely through migration, with other people and places). Internet usage also reflects and embodies connections (political, economic, and familial) with certain spheres of language and culture. The thesis goes on to argue that the Internet embodies a web of actors, meanings, ideas, digital objects and capital that has helped to shape and transform the postcolonial transnational links that Cape Verde and Cape Verdeans have maintained throughout their colonial and recent postcolonial condition. In this way it analyses the postcolonial political economy of communications of the Internet in Cape Verde by exploring the identities and subjectivities of the human actors involved in it. It explores the importance of die migratory and diasporic phenomenon in the spread of the Internet in Cape Verde and in the constitution of the Cape Verdean Internet space, as well as the Internet engagement, practices and agendas of diasporic groups both in the United States and in Portugal. When focusing on Cape Verdean Internet users in Cape Verde, the diesis scrutinizes the politics of Internet connectivity and usage in the postcolonial world. It argues that Internet usage is framed according to particular geocultural, geolinguistic and geodiasporic formations.

Collectively, these lobbies served to broaden the appreciation of the multi-layered interactions between health and society.  The appropriation of healing functions by these non-medical organisations revealed a more pluralistic discourse on medicine beyond that of the medical practitioners or public health officials. Operating simultaneously at the local, regional and international contexts, the transnational networks of these organisations open up the possibilities of a more globalised perspective of health and medicine.  The doctoral thesis hopes to historicise the phenomenon of non-government organisations in colonial Malaya, and to present new insights of the medical and socio-political contexts in which they operated.",301651155,,Dissertations & Theses," Liew, Kai KhiunLiewKhiunKaiLiew, Kai Khiun",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761105821 , 45188491 , 101309 , U238228 , U238228", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301651155?accountid=14496, 0585 Science history, 0585 Science history, 0585 Science history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0585 Science history, Science history," DXN120701 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Specifying+fevers%3A+positioning+malaya%27s+health+lobbies+%281867-1941%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liew%2C+Kai+Khiun&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Nurturing the other: wellbeing, social body &amp;amp; transformability in northeastern amazonia","This thesis deals with social and historical change and continuity among the Trio, Wayana and Akuriyo of southern Suriname and French Guiana in terms of the body and the construction of the person.  It is based on a comparative study in two principal localities on different sides of the international border, where the populations have become concentrated around medical and education providers.  My research considers this process of sedentarisation from an indigenous perspective which emphasises the new problems created by life in close physical proximity to non-relatives and potential enemies, and the management of these problems on a daily basis and through ritual celebrations.  The thesis shows the importance in this context of the means by which different types of bodies are nurtured: how bodily connections through kin are fed and maintained, and how social distance is preserved or mediated with non-relatives (in the form of co-residential affines, spirits, 'wild people', and 'white people' such as missionaries, governmental and non-governmental workers).  My analysis focuses on the distribution of substances, objects and knowledge practices and how the effects of their influence operate as a 'social body' at the levels of the collectivity and the individual person; these objects, substances and knowledge practices are considered as extensions of the person who distributes them, and the social body is formed of the aggregate of these extensions.  By focusing on movement and social relations as the interplay between what is visible and what is invisible, this thesis contributes to theoretical debates by grounding them in a contemporary Amazonia.",301672762,,Dissertations & Theses," Grotti, Vanessa ElisaGrottiElisaVanessaGrotti, Vanessa Elisa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761025531 , 45172771 , 101309 , U226413 , U226413", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301672762?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," (UMI)AAIU226413 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nurturing+the+other%3A+wellbeing%2C+social+body+%26amp%3B+transformability+in+northeastern+amazonia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grotti%2C+Vanessa+Elisa&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Private loss, public gain: orphans in Malawi.","In the twentieth century, concern with child welfare resulted in one of the fastest growing social movements in the West. From the establishment of the Save the Children Fund in the UK at the close of the First World War, to the setting up of United Nations Children’s Fund following the Second, to the near universal ratification of the Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1989, the child welfare movement has been marked by a concern with children internationally. In the last seventeen years, since the ratification of the convention, interest in the welfare of children in the developing world has grown dramatically. Children’s welfare appeared in the 1997 UK Government white paper on international development, the World Bank suggested that child welfare was a useful development indicator, and large numbers of non-governmental-organisations were established (Boyden 1990). In Southern Africa, as a result of the HIV/AIDS pandemic, the close of the twentieth century saw increasing numbers of orphans appearing. As international concern regarding the social impacts of HIV/AIDs has risen, these orphans have become an issue of particular concern (Aspaas 1997). As a result of both the increasing interest in children’s lives in general and the concern with orphans in particular, there are now a number of organisations specialising in orphan care (World Bank 2004, US Peace 2004). These projects constitute a new social arena within which children live at last part of their daily lives. This thesis is an exploration of the social significance of four orphan-care projects functioning in Malawi. The analysis is made by looking at the identity of orphan as a social construct that has various uses, meanings and symbols attached to it; and as a set of experiences that occur to children who have lost, through death, one or both of their parents.",301677887,,Dissertations & Theses," Hutchinson, E.HutchinsonE.Hutchinson, E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761026071 , 45173021 , 101309 , U233072 , U233072", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301677887?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," DXN111739 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Private+loss%2C+public+gain%3A+orphans+in+Malawi.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hutchinson%2C+E.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The british and west german protests against nuclear weapons, 1957-1964","This thesis analyses the British Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament (CND), and the Committee of 100 as well as the West German Campaign against Atomic Death and the Easter Marches of Atomic Weapons Opponents from their emergence, in 1957, to 1964, when the issue of nuclear armaments had lost much of its salience.  It examines the movements' organisations, transnational relations, cognitive orientations and forms of protest.  It describes the movements as actors in the politics of security at the time and aims to bring out the specificities of the movements' definitions of security. By making use of the insights into protest and contentious politics which sociological and political-science theories offer, this thesis seeks to present a social history of movement politics.  This study regards the campaigns as constantly evolving and dynamic movements, rather than fixed and stable entities.  It focuses on the conditions under which the multitude of experiences which the protesters brought into the movements came to be integrated into a movement which contemporary observers regarded as a homogeneous political actor.  This thesis finds that the structural processes through which the British and West German movements gained their dynamics were remarkable similar.  Yet it shows throughout that the differences in contents and resonance of these dynamics reflected the different experiences of British and West German activists in dealing with the memory of the Second World War and the dangers of the arms race in the Cold War.  By considering the issue as one of security, which lies at the heart of modern government, this study offers a proposal to re-examine the foundations of political legitimacy in Britain and West Germany after war and dictatorship and under the shadow of the nuclear bomb.  It thus seeks to go beyond teleological concepts of 'value change' and 'liberalisation' in analysing these processes.",301688185,,Dissertations & Theses," Nehring, HolgerNehringHolgerNehring, Holger",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761109411 , 44156401 , 101309 , U233220 , U233220", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301688185?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," DN113064 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+british+and+west+german+protests+against+nuclear+weapons%2C+1957-1964&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nehring%2C+Holger&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Transforming British organics: the role of central government, 1980-2006","With clear evidence of major increases in the global market for organic food, the organic ‘growth narrative’ has evolved as both the central facet of contemporary academic examination of organic agriculture and as the dominant discourse for the organic movement itself.  However, this narrative masks a dynamic complexity as changes in the organic sector have not just been of scale but are complicit in changes to the qualitative characteristics of ‘organics’. The new economic, social and political contexts in which organics are now being constructed means that it is an increasingly contested term.  In this context, the thesis is primarily concerned with the transformation of British organics towards being a successful market commodity and an agricultural policy instrument.  With a particular focus on the political sphere, the thesis examines the evolving engagement of the British government with the UK organic movement since 1980 and the materialisation of particular policy outcomes for organic agriculture.  Given the organic movement’s critique of ‘conventional’ farming, support from government has been mixed, although the study records a progressive shift in favour of organics.  It is essential to establish why organic agriculture has become a policy issue for government and, crucially, how government has dealt with the criticism of mainstream agriculture that organics contains.  The thesis identifies several ‘organic agricultural policy networks’ to conceptualise the changing relations between the government and other interests.  The study draws on the insights of an interpretative tradition which contends that policy networks are enacted by individuals.  Together, these actors have constructed three different organic ‘storylines’ that are constituted in the particular memberships of the policy network in temporally specific sets of circumstances.",301708517,,Dissertations & Theses," Tomlinson, I.J.TomlinsonI.J.Tomlinson, I.J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1761110291 , 45190981 , 101309 , U237542 , U237542", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/301708517?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," DXN117811 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transforming+British+organics%3A+the+role+of+central+government%2C+1980-2006&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tomlinson%2C+I.J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Melting the matrices: Structure, anti-structure, and the emerging conversation","This thesis investigates two cases of Christian churches, which as a part of their mission seek to accommodate people who would otherwise not be interested in church.

This thesis explores theories of time-consciousness, such as those of Kant, Husserl, Heidegger, and Sartre. Aspects of the understanding of time reflected in simple communicative gestures, as well as elements of our language such as tense, are also explored. Theoretical concepts in the natural sciences, culminating with Einstein's general theory of relativity, are examined, revealing that the rate at which we experience time is literally dependent upon our motion, and upon our proximity to mass in space. How technologies for tracking the moments of the day (from sky observations to sundials to mechanical clocks and wristwatches) are explored up until the advent of atomic clocks, which have standardized each second of time around the globe. The manner in which numerous calendars have been devised for tracking days, weeks, months, and years is summarized, including the Greek, Hebrew, and Chinese lunisolar calendars, the Islamic lunar calendar, and the Egyptian and Western solar calendars. The unique Mayan calendar is explicated. How most calendar reform movements have been based on the shared social experience of time as a characteristic of cultural identity is made clear and the concept that, despite its Christian heritage, the Western calendar has become a harbinger of global social unification is examined.

The period is defined by the early origins of social housing in the two cities and a major turning point in the publicly funded social housing system in Britain in 1979. The comparison in each chapter is structured around sections for each city with a concluding comparative section to weigh the merits of each case against each other. It is found that both cities were underpinned by industrial economies. Newcastle being a firmly established industrial city in the nineteenth century, based on heavy engineering and ship building near the river Tyne, inherited housing problems that included serious overcrowding, poverty and a high level of density. Århus was Denmark's second largest trade city, only becoming industrialized around the turn of the century, was surrounded by independent suburban municipalities that restricted expansion as migration proceeded during the first half of the twentieth century. These inheritances left their mark on subsequent housing developments: the political constitution of housing organizations and the position of these in local urban culture. Århus saw a growth in small autonomous non-profit housing associations that had their roots in collaborative processes between the long standing social democratic party and the Labour movement. Newcastle followed British national housing policy and became the key provider of council housing, rejecting housing associations as a player on the local social housing scene. This had implications for housing management in the two cities. The thesis explores through a series of themes, including managerial, planning, display culture and housing activism the inter-relationship between housing providers, their self-perception and relationship to the residents and tenants they were responsible to. The thesis concludes that sufficient equivalences exist for the two cities to be compared, however their housing systems revealed significant differences that arose from the nature of the political culture in each city. Finally it is proposed that comparative approaches which facilitate contrasting findings could benefit from widening the view to international connections and the transfer of culture and ideas.",304709101,,Dissertations & Theses," Goldsmith, Lorna ColbergGoldsmithColbergLornaGoldsmith, Lorna Colberg",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1436972481 , 38485651 , 66569 , C828747 , C828747", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304709101?accountid=14496," 0582 Modern history , 0999 Urban planning"," 0582 Modern history , 0999 Urban planning"," 0582 Modern history , 0999 Urban planning",," 0582 Modern history , 0999 Urban planning"," Modern history , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Arhus , Denmark , England , Housing , Newcastle , Political culture , Social housing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Comparative+dimensions+of+social+housing+in+%C3%85rhus+and+Newcastle%2C+1890s%E2%80%931979%3A+The+problem+of+the+political+culture+of+two+social+housing+systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goldsmith%2C+Lorna+Colberg&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Effectiveness of GPS tracking systems with paroled and probational sex offenders,"The purpose of this project report is to examine the use of global positioning satellite (GPS) tracking systems along with traditional methods of supervision.

Harding, J. M. McCaleb, William J. Bishop, and the emergence of faith missions in the Churches of Christ, 1892–1913","By 1890 the Churches of Christ earned the ignominious reputation of being ""anti-missionary"" by opposing the American Christian Missionary Society. This thesis contends that James A. Harding reversed this trend by appropriating faith missions as an alternative model for missionary support. He and his followers embodied, propagated, and firmed up his teachings so that his trust principles were woven into the missionary fabric of the newly formed identity of the Churches of Christ. Previously social historians contended that the Churches of Christ were primarily a product of the Age of Reason but their accounts have failed to account for the pietistic missionaries that this movement produced. In contrast, this dissertation highlights the role that faith, holiness, and an otherworldly perspective played in the mobilization of its first generation of missionaries. The method of investigation is historical research including archival usage and the consultation of primary sources supplemented by the historical backdrop provided by secondary materials. This dissertation employs a ""lived religion"" approach to examine the exchange of ideas between a leader, and two practitioners along with their associates, in order to construct a history of the first decades of their foreign missionary enterprise. The first chapter establishes the social and religious context in which Harding formed his trust theory and examines his influence as a preacher, educator and writer in helping these non-missionary society churches to engage in global evangelism without compromising their commitment to congregational autonomy. The second chapter describes the work of the churches' first cross-cultural missionary, John Moody McCaleb, in popularizing Harding's ideals through his prolific writing and extensive travel. The third chapter demonstrates that the tragic death of the first missionary, William J. Bishop, challenged and validated the full implementation of Harding's concepts. There are at least two implications of this study. First, the insufficiency of the rationalistic paradigm formerly applied to this religious group calls for a re-examination of its overall history in light of the spirituality of its faith-based missions. Second, by reconstructing how the trust theory took hold and emboldened missionaries of the Churches of Christ, historians now have a way more accurately defining the movement by its positive traits.",304713665,,Dissertations & Theses," Daggett, Shawn Z.DaggettZ.ShawnDaggett, Shawn Z.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1354128801 , 37160681 , 66569 , 9780549065197 , 3267737 , 3267737", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549065197, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304713665?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0337 American history"," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0337 American history"," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0337 American history",," 0304 Biographies , 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious congregations , 0337 American history"," Biographies , Religious history , Religious congregations , American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Bishop, William J. , Churches of Christ , Faith missions , Harding, James A. , McCaleb, J.

To become and remain viable, organizations must successfully respond to constantly morphing environmental conditions. An organization's response to continuously changing environmental conditions can no longer be occasional, planned change events designed to respond to what is viewed as episodic change. Organizations must have the capacity for continuous and adaptive organizational change. The capacity for continuous and adaptive organizational change (CAOC) is now an essential organizational competency. Currently, organizational change is studied and practiced, by and large, within the context of an in-step, linear paradigm that assumes change is achieved with a relatively fixed set of circumstances and within a relatively fixed timeframe. This study proposes a non-static, dimensional and adaptive theoretical framework for the study and practice of organizational change. This research was an emergent design, grounded theory study conducted in two phases. An appreciative inquiry responsive interview protocol was used. A total of 20 U.S. and global organizational development practitioners, scholars, and leaders participated in the research. Phase I of the study resulted in (a) defining organizational change sustainability as continuous, anticipative, and adaptive movement (thinking and action) taken by organizational members to achieve a desired future; (b) identifying the nine dimensions of CAOC (leadership, environmental savvy, learning/teaching, mobilization, systems, focus, values congruence, beliefs, and will (exercising choice); and, (c) defining CAOC as a complex social system embodying six defining characteristics: non-linearity, multi-dimension, adaptive capacity, maximized velocity, diametrical forces of chaos and order, and relational dependency. Phase I of this study concludes that advancement of knowledge and practice of organizational change will come through non-traditional theoretical frameworks that enable the study of non-linear, dimensional organizational change. Phase II of this study compared U.S. and global perspectives related to CAOC. Phase II comparative analysis results reveal strong convergence between U.S. and global experiences and perspectives related to continuous and adaptive organizational change.

Situated at the frontier of China's territory, the Overseas Chinese city was among the first in China to receive foreign influences on economic, cultural and social changes and therefore became one of the major testing grounds for China's modern urban transformation. This thesis will examine the dynamics of architectural change in the typical Overseas Chinese city of Xiamen in southern Fujian and explore the role that Overseas Chinese played in the process. The study will start with the analysis of the socio-economics and socio-politics of the Overseas Chinese, and relate the modern transformation of Xiamen to their initial motive of hometown salvation through development of the local economy as well as establishment of a cultural identity, which played a crucial role in transforming Xiamen into both a commercial metropolis and cultural hub in southern China at that time. In order to trace the source of inspiration which motivated the Overseas Chinese to start the architectural and urban transformation in Xiamen, two colonial enclaves—Singapore and the Gulangyu International Settlement are carefully studied. Prompted by a similar concern for economic development, Xiamen followed these colonial predecessors closely by establishing a modern municipality, improving port facilities, transportation, and hygiene conditions. It led to a building boom in Xiamen which attracted an influx of overseas capital and generated many opportunities for both architectural professionals and local craftsmen. In addition to economic development, the Overseas Chinese were also committed to promoting the educational well-being of Xiamen. This coincided with the new cultural movement unleashed by the May Fourth Movement in 1919, which emphasized the importance of education in achieving modern statehood. During the early 20 th century, Xiamen had witnessed the establishment of many Huaqiao Schools. New building forms, styles, technologies and materials were first and widely used in these educational establishments and an architectural exploration towards a cultural identity was initiated. Among them, two significant examples—Jimei Schools and Xiamen University are carefully studied here to demonstrate the impact that they exerted on the urban built environment of Xiamen.",304729297,,Dissertations & Theses," Yu, YangYuYangYu, Yang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1647126971 , 37705021 , 66569 , 0820828 , 0820828", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304729297?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0332 History , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0332 History , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning",," 0332 History , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," History , Architecture , Urban planning"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Architecture , China , Overseas Chinese , Twentieth century , Urbanism , Xiamen",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Remaking+Xiamen%3A+Overseas+Chinese+and+regional+transformation+in+architecture+and+urbanism+in+the+early+20th+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yu%2C+Yang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Art and democracy: New Brunswick artists and Canadian culture between the Great Depression and the Cold War,"The 1930s Depression had devastating effects on the already struggling economy of Saint John, New Brunswick. Yet, the decade has been recalled as a “golden age” for art in the city. If the age was not financially “golden” for the city's artists, several—including, particularly, Jack Humphrey and Miller Brittain—produced a body of work that garnered sufficient critical praise to be remembered by later art historians as well as public and private art collectors. Remembering these artists as heroic individuals who overcame the poverty and cultural isolation of their native city to become successful artists, however, forgets the important ways in which both local and national cultural contexts shaped their artistic production. This dissertation explores Saint John and other New Brunswick artists as a cultural community that responded to local circumstances as well as national and international artistic and ideological trends. A comparison of the cultural content of three Canadian magazines provides an ideological map on which to situate the New Brunswick artists that are the primary focus of this dissertation. The map which emerges illustrates that, in both art and politics, the late 1930s were years of convergence: once-radical opinions and artworks began to be accepted by centrists, while committed leftists became more interested in forms and art once considered decadent. This convergence, in part, explains how a figure like Nova Scotia-based critic Walter Abell could be simultaneously a cultural radical and a member of the cultural elite. The dissertation next traces Abel's career in Canada between 1928 and 1944. Abell was a lynchpin figure in this period: his life and work connect contemporary politics with aesthetics, Canada with the United States, the Maritimes with Central Canada, and New Brunswick artists with some of the period's leading institutions and organizations. The second part of the dissertation focuses on the artists of Saint John and Fredericton. It begins biographically, rooting a number of the cities' artists in their local context and explaining individual factors that influenced artistic practice. It then explores a number of the common philosophical aspects of these individual practices: the promotion and execution of popular forms of art, a critique of modern industrial society, and a belief that artists needed to be actively engaged in social issues. These common practices can be best understood as a regional manifestation of an international left-wing cultural movement which coalesced around social-democratic, anti-fascist politics between the mid-1930s and the end of the Second World War.",304729697,,Dissertations & Theses," Niergarth, KirkNiergarthKirkNiergarth, Kirk",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1967037301 , 50888421 , 66569 , 9780494565490 , NR56549 , NR56549", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494565490, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304729697?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0377 Art history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0377 Art history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0377 Art history",," 0334 Canadian history , 0377 Art history"," Canadian history , Art history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Artists , Cold War , Culture , Democracy , Great Depression , New Brunswick",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Art+and+democracy%3A++New+Brunswick+artists+and+Canadian+culture+between+the+Great+Depression+and+the+Cold+War&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Niergarth%2C+Kirk&amp;isbn=9780494565490&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Strategies and successes in influencing education policy change: A case study of the Tanzanian Education Network (TEN/MET),"Civil society networks have emerged as potentially important actors in the education policy of Southern countries since the new millennium.

Although not a recent phenomenon, the conditions of globalization have facilitated a record number of people crossing international borders for work, leisure, safety and security. Among these groups, tourists and labour migrants account for the largest groups traveling worldwide. Although these two groups differ in their motivations and goals of travel, they share at least one common condition, the ability, to varying degrees, to be mobile. In this thesis I juxtapose two types of seasonal movements in order to examine the interconnections between mobility, space and identity. I examine mobility on two trajectories and in two sites: First, I ask whether contemporary forms of seasonal mobility create new transnational spaces. My second question is how seasonal mobilities contribute to the formation of subjectivities. Two groups of mobile populations form the focus of this study—seasonal tourists in Mexico and seasonal agricultural workers in Canada. A spatial ethnographic method developed for this project is utilized to map the changes occurring, while a combination of spatial and subjectivity theories provide the lens through which I analyze how our mobilities are increasingly defining who we are and where we go. Despite the rhetoric of increasing equality and access to travel, I show that mobility is neither an egalitarian experience nor a homogenous category organizing social relations. Race, citizenship, class and gender continue to shape the facility or difficulty in crossing borders and the reception received in destination countries. In addition, the ways in which these mobilities are ""hailed,"" whether as tourists or as migrant workers, condition living and working arrangements, creating almost unparalleled liberties for one group and severely restricted controls for the other. The changing topographies of place is the second focus. The rural spaces that each of these seasonal groups resides in are undergoing major changes. From lattes and gated communities in Puerto to chipotles and school bus Fridays in Simcoe, seasonal tourists and seasonal migrant workers are creating new cultural forms and producing novel social relations that reflect their different levels of integration in the two communities.",304760502,,Dissertations & Theses," Gogia, NupurGogiaNupurGogia, Nupur",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1566809051 , 37417891 , 66569 , 9780494396629 , NR39662 , NR39662", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494396629, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304760502?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0510 Labor economics , 0626 Sociology , 0814 Recreation , 0938 Demographics"," 0366 Geography , 0510 Labor economics , 0626 Sociology , 0814 Recreation , 0938 Demographics"," 0366 Geography , 0510 Labor economics , 0626 Sociology , 0814 Recreation , 0938 Demographics",," 0366 Geography , 0510 Labor economics , 0626 Sociology , 0814 Recreation , 0938 Demographics"," Geography , Labor economics , Sociology , Recreation , Demographics , Studies"," Social sciences , Agricultural workers , Leisure , Mexico , Mobile corridors , Seasonal movements , Tourists",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mobile+corridors%3A++Unpacking+the+global+voyages+of+labour+and+leisure&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gogia%2C+Nupur&amp;isbn=9780494396629&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Characterizing the current state of education of individuals with disabilities in Kuwait: Developing a baseline for reflection and action,"This study highlights the challenges inherent in attempting to explore and characterize special education models of practice in developing nations. Many such nations, where individuals with disabilities have traditionally been excluded from mainstream education, are increasingly joining in the global movement promoting the rights of all individuals to full participation in mainstream schools and other social institutions. Despite the proliferation of the rhetoric of inclusive special education practices, special education models in many of those countries have never developed in a way that allows a straightforward comparison relative to universally prevalent conceptions and notions. Survey studies that measure attitudes or perceptions, analyses that use international indicators or indexes to compare countries in terms of applying ""modern"" practices, or thematic analyses that typify sorts of people, beliefs and behaviors, may not be the best (or most appropriate) research tools for understanding special education practices in developing countries. They are not sufficient because they can often overlook examining the local conditions that interact with and reshape imported educational polices and practices. I drew upon analytical and research design options, geared towards exploring educational practice as a contextualized social phenomenon, to design a qualitative inquiry aimed at providing culture and context-specific description of public special education services in Kuwait. In this dissertation, I report on the methods and findings of this inquiry, hoping that the analytical and theoretical perspective from which the inquiry was conducted can serve as a promising framework for guiding the analysis of special educations models in countries like Kuwait. Results emerged from exploring the special education model implemented in Kuwait were compared to findings from other studies that examined that model to suggest some analytical and theoretical guidelines to enabling deeper more realistic characterization of special education practice in a developing nation. A multidimensional analytic approach implemented within a mode of inquiry that keeps the social of the educational program and its organizing work processes in view, can help scholars move beyond analyses that are based on the ""universal buzz words"", and start to interrogate what these concepts mean to all stakeholders, and what they entail in practice.",304766041,,Dissertations & Theses," Almuhareb, Khaled A.AlmuharebA.KhaledAlmuhareb, Khaled A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1453185521 , 37909891 , 66569 , 9780549370529 , 3291570 , 3291570", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549370529, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304766041?accountid=14496, 0529 Special education, 0529 Special education, 0529 Special education,, 0529 Special education, Special education," Education , Comparative education , Disabilities , Disability , Kuwait , Special education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Characterizing+the+current+state+of+education+of+individuals+with+disabilities+in+Kuwait%3A+Developing+a+baseline+for+reflection+and+action&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Almuhareb%2C+Khaled+A.&amp;isbn=9780549370529&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Fair trade coffee in Costa Rica: A new model for sustainable development?,"Costa Rica offers an excellent case study due to its historically distinctive democracy, nationalist tradition, and unique economic development, all aspects historically intertwined with coffee production in this country. This study examines the current situation of coffee producers and the coffee industry, both of which operate under the guidelines of the global commodity chain (GCC), a global trading mechanism that creates power and income disparities among the different actors involved. Fair trade has emerged as an alternative to the GCC with the potential to offer social, economic, and environmental benefits to coffee producers and their communities. This dissertation questions whether fair trade can offer an alternative model of development for coffee producers in Costa Rica in the era of globalization. Cooperatives can be sites of progressive and social empowerment and the fair trade movement, sharing many of these goals, alternatively markets their products. Drawing upon primary and secondary data, including field research and interviews, this research project examines the nine cooperative members of the consortium COOCAFE from two different angles: first, as cooperatives that offer benefits for its members; second, as fair trade cooperatives that offer fair trade advantages not available to any other coffee cooperative in Costa Rica outside the consortium. A wide spectrum of cooperative and fair trade cooperative attributes and services are examined. The study, moving beyond this initial set of criteria, further examines two issues: environmental sustainability and gender. Ecological issues that derive from coffee production, such as deforestation, water and soil pollution, and loss of biodiversity are examined to determine if the cooperatives do indeed maintain sustainability while producing coffee, following fair trade criteria. Also, this dissertation addresses the absence of women in the literature of agriculture and development, and examines the role/s that women involved in the cooperatives have in the production of fair trade coffee and the extent to which fair trade benefits women in particular. The study concludes that fair trade, as an alternative trading mechanism, has the potential to counterbalance the detrimental outcomes produced by neoliberal free market policies by deconstructing the notion of development and re-designing global trade systems, making small producers more relevant in the global commodity market.",304766440,,Dissertations & Theses," Pongratz-Chander, KrisztinaPongratz-ChanderKrisztinaPongratz-Chander, Krisztina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1320970821 , 36649991 , 66569 , 3257741 , 3257741", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304766440?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations"," Political science , International law , International relations , Fair trade , Models , Sustainable development , Costa Rica"," Social sciences , Alternative development , Coffee , Costa Rica , Fair trade , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fair+trade+coffee+in+Costa+Rica%3A++A+new+model+for+sustainable+development%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pongratz-Chander%2C+Krisztina&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The migration of meaning: A comparative analysis of understandings of &lt;i&gt;Orçamento Participativo&lt;/i&gt; in Porto Alegre and participatory budgeting in the Toronto Community Housing Corporation,"In 1989, the Brazilian city of Porto Alegre initiated a successful model of Participatory Budgeting, which has subsequently been implemented in cities throughout the world, including in the Toronto Community Housing Corporation. This paper analyses differences in understanding and shifts in meaning that occur when a Participatory Budgeting model from a Brazilian Portuguese Porto-Alegrense socio-political historical and cultural context is translocated to a Canadian English Toronto context. By examining five key terms, I compare the understandings of Orçamento Participativo in Porto Alegre to Participatory Budgeting in Toronto. Different understandings may result in different outcomes. This paper is based on De Sousa Santos' call for a giant work of translation, which includes a greater need for understanding of the differences between international social movements within the World Social Forum. Greater understanding will open a space for dialogue and mutual learning, creating a path towards emancipation from the neoliberal agenda.* Key Words.

""the subject of walking is, in some sense, about how we invest universal acts with particular meanings. Like eating or breathing, it can be invested with wildly different cultural meanings, from the erotic to the spiritual, from the revolutionary to the artistic. Here this history (of walking) begins to become part of the history of the imagination and culture, of what kind of pleasure, freedom, and meaning are pursued at different times by different kinds of walks and walkers."" (Wanderlust: A History of Walking, R. Solnit) Scale, space and the form of architecture relate to the dimensions and proportions of human beings. We engage with our environment on innumerable levels related to the rhythm, measure, and aesthetics of these proportions. Focusing on bipedal movement through the built environment, this thesis will explore how the position of the body might may be influential in the creation of architecture. How can the position of the body be developed into architectural space? How can a space created for a certain scale of the body be translated into other larger programs that involve walking and movement? What level of detail, mental effects, aesthetic and architectural design decisions does walking uniquely generate, compared to other forms of travel through the built environment? What kind of architectural system and process can be developed to explore these ideas? Statement of significance of issue. Our contemporary dependence on the automobile and the biological hardships our bodies suffer based on our lack of exercise are well documented. Walking gives one time and oxygen with which to think and ""digest"" thoughts. Our world is eliminating this ""down time"" because it is considered to be unproductive. (Solnit, R.) Today, over 50% of Americans live in suburbs. In large part due to these arrangements, walking throughout the suburbs is a quite rarely shared activity. However, at other moments in history, walking has played an important role. The design explorations of Constant Nieuwenhuis's New Babylon, and the philosophy of the Situationists International are entangled with concept of experiencing space on foot, or wandering. The Situationists focus on the importance of ""the derive"" and the chance meetings, social interactions and infinite possibilities that are possible through this process. In 1992, Sadie Plant wrote in ""The Most Radical Gesture: The Situationist International in a Post Modern Age"": ""to dérive was to notice the way in which certain areas, streets, or buildings resonate with states of mind, inclinations, and de sires, and to seek out reasons for movement other than those for which an environment was designed."" Within this concept individuals collaborate with those they meet to modify their environment. In Constant's New Babylon, creativity is therefore a social act, as people take charge of their environment. While Constant's vision is not exactly plausible today, it does relate to our reality, in the sense that we constantly create our environment and experiences in collaboration with others and the elements around us, perhaps not with the same freedom Constant envisioned, yet with the same expression of purpose. To derive through a built environment means to discover psychogeography, which is defined by the Situationists as centers of gravity, contours, and ""unities of atmosphere"". (Debord 1956 ""Theory of the Derive"") Movement through architecture as a way to experience it has become a relevant topic in many circles, from the Situationists to the urban planner Kevin Lynch, whose research focused on the study of human awareness in the urban environment. In particular he defines certain characteristics that form one's ""mental map"" of a city. He emphasizes the term ""sequence design"" to describe how we could think about architecture and the experience of the urban environment. Method of inquiry. After a period of study into the Situationists International, Constant's New Babylon, and the subject of walking and positions of the body in architecture, this thesis will focus on the design, construction and presentation of a material installation. The scale will be of a small space for the human occupation of walking. As a material driven study, this project will construct a micro-environment in which studies of space can be interpreted by the viewer. An investigation into process and production will form the components of the installation. Expected outcome.

Social contract theory begins with the assumption that a society exists; it cannot tell us who should be part of the social contract. Despite appearances, Rawlsian theory does provide standards for evaluating immigration policy. This dissertation shows that admitting refugees is an obligation of justice. More surprisingly, states must grant immigration permits to co-ethnics. Even more strikingly, there are circumstances when justice demands that individuals be denied admission based on their ethnicity. I begin by establishing that Rawls's theory is not founded on moral principles of universal scope. Rather, 'justice as fairness' is an application to society of standards commonly used to evaluate the fairness of a contract. I then refute arguments claiming that Rawls's principles must be applied to the entire globe. Since principle 2(b) establishes a right to equal opportunity for social positions, if the ""global justice"" theorists' arguments are successful, then any immigration restriction whatsoever is, prima facie, unjust. I show that Rawls's principles are appropriate only when there is both economic and political cooperation. Cosmopolitan theorists argue that we must, in fact, establish political institutions of global scope. I show that despite the increasing importance of trans-state economic and cultural interaction, maintaining the sovereign state system is legitimate. I outline suggestions for the system's reform rather than abandonment. In Chapter Three, I sort out widespread confusion regarding ethnicity and ethnic-nationalism. I provide a conception of ethnicity that moves beyond the debate over its being ""constructed"" versus ""primordial"". I dispel pernicious associations, explaining the Nazi movement as Imperialist —not nationalist. I deal with claims that nations are a modern phenomenon rather than having an ancient past. I argue against theorists who claim ethnic-nationalism is a threat to equality, autonomy, and dignity. I reject contemporary ""liberal nationalists"" conceptualizations, and present my own understanding of ethnic-nationalism. Finally, I examine ethnicity-based provisions and exclusions in Israeli immigration policy. My treatment is informed by an interim report of the Israeli Government Advisory Committee to Examine Immigration Policies, which I have translated and included as Appendix C.",304788465,,Dissertations & Theses," Ernst, DanErnstDanErnst, Dan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1379559451 , 37474441 , 66569 , 9780549066002 , 3267243 , 3267243", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549066002, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304788465?accountid=14496," 0422 Philosophy , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0422 Philosophy , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0422 Philosophy , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0751 Judaic studies",," 0422 Philosophy , 0616 International law , 0616 International relations , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology , 0751 Judaic studies"," Philosophy , International law , International relations , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology , Judaic studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Ethics , Global justice , Immigration , Israeli , Law of Return , Nationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+ethics+of+immigration%3A+Global+justice%2C+nationalism%2C+and+the+Israeli+Law+of+Return&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ernst%2C+Dan&amp;isbn=9780549066002&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Decisions at scientific agencies: How do the NIH and the FDA balance expert opinions, changing agendas, and political pressure?","This dissertation examines the circumstances in which the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), both scientific agencies that are shaped by the culture of science and reliance on scientific experts, respond to political pressure from advocacy groups and elected officials. The conceptual framework builds on the existing literature on bureaucratic behavior by suggesting that unique characteristics of scientific agencies lead them to be more inclined to seek bureaucratic autonomy from Congress in order to insulate agency decision-making from non-scientific concerns. However, these agencies are asked to consider many other factors including the changing agendas of politicians, interest groups, and the media, the fact that the experts themselves may be biased, and underlying social needs for research and results. The empirical analysis, relying on data from the period 1970 through 2004, explores how external actors pierce this ""veil"" of scientific autonomy. The first paper examines the impact of a social movement on the NIH. In the early 1990s, women's health advocates charged that the NIH was not enforcing its own policies for gender equity. Hypotheses are developed to explain which policy decisions might have been affected by women's health advocacy. The analysis uses a new dataset to consider the effects of external pressure on priority setting, personnel decisions, and procedural concerns. The second paper expands the conceptual framework by comparing agency responses, not across decision categories but instead across agencies. The characteristics of three types of scientific agencies are described and hypotheses about how they might respond to similar pressure are proposed. The analysis focuses on priority setting for cancer, mental health, global health, and HIV/AIDS at these types of agencies. The third paper focuses on Congressional oversight of scientific agencies. Politicians are usually not experts on science policy, so members of Congress should be more comfortable evaluating bureaucratic concerns than the use of science. The analysis examines instances of conflict and disagreement between Congress and the NIH and the FDA to assess what issues are important to Congress and provide insights on how these agencies have historically been able to be relatively autonomous.",304788852,,Dissertations & Theses," Quon, Nicole CiewhonQuonCiewhonNicoleQuon, Nicole Ciewhon"," Food & Drug Administration--FDA922190 , National Institutes of Health923120", Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1407502941 , 37530911 , 66569 , 9780549067108 , 3267350 , 3267350", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549067108, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304788852?accountid=14496," 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science"," 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science"," 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science",," 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science"," Public health , Political science , Decision making , Government agencies"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Advocacy groups , Food and Drug Administration , National Institutes of Health , Political pressure",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Decisions+at+scientific+agencies%3A+How+do+the+NIH+and+the+FDA+balance+expert+opinions%2C+changing+agendas%2C+and+political+pressure%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Quon%2C+Nicole+Ciewhon&amp;isbn=9780549067108&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Growing organic bananas in Ecuador,"This project examines organic banana production in El Oro, Ecuador.

An archivally researched comparative study of labor movements in the southern metropolitan department of the Aude and the Caribbean colony of Guadeloupe, the project challenges traditional studies of citizen formation in France, which understand political differences between metropolitan and colonial citizenship to be the product of cultural definitions of “Frenchness” and republicanism. I contend that these cultural understandings of citizenship and nation in fact emerged from tensions within a concept of republican citizenship that privileged political over economic equality. This dissertation examines this process through a comparison of two sets of rural citizens—the winegrowers of the Aude and the sugar producers of Guadeloupe—and their struggles against a common set of problems stemming from the integration of France into the global market. It argues that local workers, economic elites, and politicians all struggled against vague and paralyzing economic pressures by appealing to the French Republic for assistance; these requests reflected their idea that the “true” Republic was one that helped its citizens with concrete aid. Above all, Audois and Guadeloupeans citizens insisted that French citizenship entitled them to economic and political equality. The French state, however, sought social and political stability over equality. In moments of economic and imperial expansion when sources of labor from abroad were bountiful the French state was able to accommodate the demands of both Guadeloupeans and the Audois. Heightened global economic competition, imperialism and shrinking labor markets limited the Republic's ability to balance these two objectives, especially in Guadeloupe. Economic productivity in the colonies ultimately became the foundation, at least in theory, for metropolitan France's future prosperity and the Republic's stability. In balancing the need for economic productivity in the colonies and social and political stability in the metropole, the Third Republic created the basis for two different—and unequal—forms of citizenship in the Aude and Guadeloupe.",304794437,,Dissertations & Theses," Heath, Elizabeth A.HeathA.ElizabethHeath, Elizabeth A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1425295221 , 35856111 , 66569 , 9780549296768 , 3287047 , 3287047", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549296768, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304794437?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0335 European history , 0582 History",," 0335 European history , 0582 History"," European history , History"," Social sciences , Aude , Citizenship , Colonialism , Empire , France , Guadeloupe , Nation , Sugar , Wine",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultivating+the+nation%2C+refining+empire%3A++Wine%2C+sugar%2C+and%0Acitizenship+in+the+Aude+and+Guadeloupe%2C+1880%E2%80%931910&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heath%2C+Elizabeth+A.&amp;isbn=9780549296768&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Blue notes in black and white: Photography, race, and the image of jazz, 1936–1965","The photography of jazz created a visual rhetoric that argued for racial inclusiveness in the 1930s, racial equality in the 1940s and 1950s, and black cultural nationalism in the 1960s. The identification of the music as culturally African American had to be constructed over time by the interaction of musicians with visual representation in the contexts of depression and war, record business economics, the evolving civil rights movement, and the dynamics of interracial collaboration and black self-assertion over the course of decades. Although these goals were often complicated by the racial discourse in the jazz press and by the claims made upon the music by competing political and economic agendas, photographs describe the social and political significance of jazz in American cultural history. In the 1930s and 1940s, photojournalists Charles Peterson and Gjon Mili challenged Life 's racial template, promoting an inclusive social vision. They visually represented the significance of African American musical culture in their images of Louis Armstrong, Duke Ellington, and others even as the magazine exerted editorial control that served segregationist and U.S. nationalist agendas. In the late 1940s, William Gottlieb's and Herman Leonard's photographs gave dramatic visual form to bebop's strong African American identity. They could not save the music from commercial failure—despite Dizzy Gillespie's camera-ready approach to publicity—but created long-neglected archives of canonizing photographs. In the 1950s, the long-playing record album developed by Columbia Records temporarily revived jazz's fortunes. Miles Davis, recording for the major label, achieved uncompromising control of his image on album covers while being broadly marketed as an international pop star. Sonny Rollins challenged a black/white racial dichotomy in the album covers of small independent labels on the east and west coasts, engaging established cultural tropes and asserting the moral necessity of a politics of equality. As the jazz audience declined in the 1960s, Roy DeCarava's images of John Coltrane drew inspiration from the music to create a black aesthetic in photography. In the context of 1960s black cultural nationalism, he constructed jazz as a predominantly African American art form while retaining the essential humanism of his work.",304797265,,Dissertations & Theses," Cawthra, Benjamin ScottCawthraScottBenjaminCawthra, Benjamin Scott",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1342728241 , 37018061 , 66569 , 9780549070481 , 3268014 , 3268014", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549070481, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304797265?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0325 African Americans , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0323 American studies , 0325 African Americans , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0323 American studies , 0325 African Americans , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0323 American studies , 0325 African Americans , 0337 American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American studies , African Americans , American history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , African-American , DeCarava, Roy , Gottlieb, William , Jazz , Jili, Gjon , Leonard, Herman , Peterson, Charles , Photography , Race",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Blue+notes+in+black+and+white%3A+Photography%2C+race%2C+and%0Athe+image+of+jazz%2C+1936%E2%80%931965&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cawthra%2C+Benjamin+Scott&amp;isbn=9780549070481&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"NGOs as agents of historical change: A comparative study of violence against women in Argentina and Brazil,"This study examined the issue of violence against women in Latin America as it is addressed by non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the region.

International and national conferences as well as domestic changes in legislation were examined in comparison to the historical trajectory of NGOs in Latin America. Violence against women was defined and its varieties and causes were identified. The difficulties of data analysis in the area of violence against women were listed. The importance of the women’s movement was analyzed in historical context with the actions of NGOs in Argentina and Brazil. Case studies of NGOs in each country were used to examine: the definition of historical impact, current projects, theoretical strengths/weaknesses and value as an alternative in solving social problems. It was found that NGOs have indeed had a positive impact on the issue of violence against women in Argentina and Brazil. The recent increase in statistical occurrence could be attributed to increased reporting, not a de facto rise in violence. The most effective method for producing a positive impact was found to be the combined efforts of both institutional and non-governmental organizations. The results also indicate that, in comparison to other social issues in Latin America, the movement to end violence against women has been the most successful.",304803893,,Dissertations & Theses," Wilhide, Nicolette M.WilhideM.NicoletteWilhide, Nicolette M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1464111231 , 38917941 , 66569 , 9780549429371 , 1451686 , 1451686", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549429371, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304803893?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0733 Gender studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0733 Gender studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0733 Gender studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0733 Gender studies"," Latin American history , Womens studies , Political science , Gender studies", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=NGOs+as+agents+of+historical+change%3A+A+comparative+study+of+violence+against+women+in+Argentina+and+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wilhide%2C+Nicolette+M.&amp;isbn=9780549429371&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Political vision: Aesthetics and politics in the salons of Les XX (1884–1893),"This study examines the intersection between art and politics in the salons of Les XX, a group of some twenty, mostly Belgian, artists organizing international exhibitions of art in Brussels, Belgium between 1884 and 1893. The fact that Les XX derived a significant base of support from some of the most prominent members of the Belgian Socialist Party, the Parti Ouvrier belge (POB) is well established in the literature. The implications of this relationship with respect to how it shaped the artistic program of these salons is less precisely understood. A seeming paradox complicates an easy understanding of the radical political dimension to these salons: as the POB attempted to consolidate and collectivize the working classes through the 1880s in Belgium, Les XX gradually turned away from a style of social realism---a style of art focused on the real life conditions of the working classes---to embrace what it considered ""modern"" art, a style focused instead on the novel form and expressive autonomy of its creator. The goal of this study is to understand how this turn among Les XX related to the radical politics of the period. It is important to acknowledge that the Belgian socialist movement embraced a very specific notion of revolution, one in which the abolition of a capitalist system might be achieved through the electoral process and the subsequent establishment of a socialist state. Through an examination of the art of these salons, sociological and physiological texts of the period, as well as evidence assembled from the writings of the various socialist supporters of Les XX, and L'Art moderne , the latter the primary literary organ for the group, this study suggests that justifying such a shift in style as radical, and informing the debates over this shift that would ensue, was a body of ideas focused on the affective experience of art. The break with social realism occurred because it was believed too directly derived from real, social conditions to change the perceptions of its viewer.",304816255,,Dissertations & Theses," Boston, Leah CatherineBostonCatherineLeahBoston, Leah Catherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1317326831 , 36350671 , 66569 , 3258671 , 3258671", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304816255?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Aesthetics , Belgium , Les XX , Politics , Salons",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+vision%3A+Aesthetics+and+politics+in+the+salons+of%0ALes+XX+%281884%E2%80%931893%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Boston%2C+Leah+Catherine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""From Morning Watch to Quiet Time: The historical and theological development of private prayer in Anglo -American Protestant instruction, 1870–1950","Protestant devotionalism—and particularly evangelical prayer—is an untold story. The two-party paradigm in the study of Protestantism has assumed evangelical prayer unchanging during the period 1870–1950. However, Sam Shoemaker's description of his switch from the Morning Watch to the Quiet Time in the 1920s demonstrates that the period was one of change, leaving us with a two-fold question about (1) the rise of the Morning Watch and (2) the rise of the Quiet Time. Using an historical theological analysis, this dissertation helps answer that two-fold question. The Morning Watch arose at the intersection of Victorian militaristic fervor—with its religious outworking in muscular Christianity—and the Keswick movement's social network, theology of empowerment and emphasis on global evangelization. Within this context, Keswick authors developed the Morning Watch, the YMCA's John Mott being first to use the term. These authors constructed a specific ""sin of prayerlessness"" and often limited their definition of prayer to petition—""getting things from God."" They interpreted private morning prayer as cosmic battle, viewing prayer as a weapon with which they attacked satanic enemies to further global evangelization—a practice that was called ""praying imperially."" Shifting cultural and theological currents set the stage for the fall of the Morning Watch and the rise of the Quiet Time by the 1920s. A.B. Simpson's ""discovery"" of listening prayer through a Quaker printing of French Quietist works around 1880 marks the beginning of the Quiet Time. The Quiet Time grew in popularity as the Morning Watch declined in tandem with cultural changes after 1920: the decline of muscular Christianity and the increasing busyness and pessimism of modern life. Rather than warfare, the Quiet Time made quietness a key component of evangelical devotionalism. Prayer became spiritual communion whose central benefit lie—not on the mission field—but within the soul praying. Petition gave way to a renewed emphasis on listening to God. The Quiet Time's full acceptance as the evangelical spirituality came with the rise of neo-evangelicalism in the 1940s, a movement whose founding institutions embraced it as normative, making it the dominant form of evangelical piety today.",304819252,,Dissertations & Theses," Johnson, Gregory O.JohnsonO.GregoryJohnson, Gregory O.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1417803641 , 37950171 , 66569 , 9780549207634 , 3280209 , 3280209", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549207634, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304819252?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0323 American studies , 0469 Theology"," 0320 Religious history , 0323 American studies , 0469 Theology"," 0320 Religious history , 0323 American studies , 0469 Theology",," 0320 Religious history , 0323 American studies , 0469 Theology"," Religious history , American studies , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Anglo-American , Devotion , Fundamentalism , Morning Watch , Private prayer , Protestant , Quiet Time",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+Morning+Watch+to+Quiet+Time%3A+The+historical+and+theological+development+of+private+prayer+in+Anglo+-American+Protestant+instruction%2C+1870%E2%80%931950&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Gregory+O.&amp;isbn=9780549207634&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Pragmatism and the frontier narrative in “It Is: A Magazine for Abstract Art”,"The first generation of Abstract Expressionists took pride in declaring their independence from European influences. By the late 1950s, however, criticism of the movement had gained momentum, and the artists found themselves in need of explaining the continued social relevance of their aesthetic theories. This period is a moment of transition between art movements, which allows for an examination of the close connection between the aesthetic narratives that distinguished the movement and the cultural narratives that are their context, as well as elements of change and continuity between Abstract Expressionism and Pop Art and Minimalism. The subject of this study is the art journal, It Is: A Magazine for Abstract Art, published from 1959 to 1965 and the personal archives of the editor, Philip Pavia, who had a fundamental role in shaping the magazine's content. As editor, Pavia wanted to provide a venue for the debate on the problem of the institutionalization of the movement, as well as the need to defend the purity of the abstract art from new tendencies. In his ""Manifesto-in-Progress,"" Pavia adapted the theories of William James to the Abstract Expressionist aesthetic theory. At the same time, Pavia and other artists in It Is were encoding their aesthetic practice in the discourse of the frontier narratives. In doing so, the artists were dealing with the issues of ""Americanness"" and ideological relevance of their work. At the time, society was questioning the validity of many of the assumptions of the nature of the individual and the place of the U.S. in international politics. The statements of the artists show how different cultural personae were projected into the aesthetic narratives in ways that closely linked the artists to the popular media, especially the western genre. A sharp line is often drawn between the Abstract Expressionism and the art of the sixties and seventies, but the documents in It Is point towards a complex internalization of some ideological elements and a shift in perspective of others. The result is a dialogue between aesthetic canons and cultural values of different generations of artists.",304819309,,Dissertations & Theses," Pascoe-Chavez, Diana F.Pascoe-ChavezF.DianaPascoe-Chavez, Diana F.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1591183531 , 37950241 , 66569 , 9780549749967 , 3324201 , 3324201", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549749967, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304819309?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0708 Mass communications"," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0708 Mass communications"," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0708 Mass communications",," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0708 Mass communications"," American studies , Art history , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Abstract Expressionism , Artist texts , Frontier narratives , It Is: A Magazine for Abstract Art , Little journals , Magazine , Pavia, Philip , Pragmatism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pragmatism+and+the+frontier+narrative+in+%E2%80%9CIt+Is%3A+A+Magazine+for+Abstract+Art%E2%80%9D&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pascoe-Chavez%2C+Diana+F.&amp;isbn=9780549749967&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A Christian century: Liberal Protestantism, the New Deal, and the origins of post -war American politics","This study pioneers a church-centered approach to American political development with specific reference to the New Deal. The record of liberal Protestant political action demonstrates that the New Deal was a Protestant project. The scope and timing of reform had much to do with the extent of liberal Protestant efforts that emerged out of the Social Gospel Movement. Liberal Protestants began efforts towards racial equality in the 1920s with anti-lynching campaigns and advocated for fair employment in the 1930s. In the 1940s, liberal Protestants indicted segregation and helped build the organizational basis for the Civil Rights Movement. Regarding labor policy, liberal Protestants were early advocates for collective bargaining rights and lobbied for the National Labor Relations Act in 1935. As labor power grew, liberal Protestants changed from championing the labor movement to criticizing labor's limited goals. Simultaneously, neo-conservative evangelicals began organizing to save the country from perceived immorality in the New Deal and specifically to control the growth of organized labor. On foreign policy, liberal Protestants advocated outlawing war and reducing armaments in the 1920s and 1930s. During WWII they articulated broad ideas about political reconstruction of the international system and were led by John Foster Dulles. Their efforts built support for the United Nations. After WWII, religion became a Cold War weapon as policymakers sought to use religion to advance American foreign policy goals. While the New Deal and its aftermath were influenced by a variety of secular actors, few rivaled Protestantism in terms of breadth, scope and duration of efforts. As this study demonstrates, religious institutions are significant sources of authority in American politics. Comprehensive accounts of American political development must include religion. Historical institutional scholarship should include non-state actors. Qualitative research was conducted at political and religious archives for three case studies on labor, race and foreign policy. The origins of American post-war politics can be understood through a church-centered approach. The growth of neo-conservative evangelical organizations that challenged the New Deal originated in 1930s, much earlier than commonly thought. Key coalitions, organizations, and advocacies were developed during the New Deal and institutionalized by the early 1950s.",304820069,,Dissertations & Theses," Janson, Michael A.JansonA.MichaelJanson, Michael A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1335357751 , 36900471 , 66569 , 3260922 , 3260922", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304820069?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science"," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science"," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science",," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history , 0615 Political science"," Religion , American history , Political science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Christian , Foreign policy , Liberal Protestantism , New Deal , Politics , Postwar , Social gospel",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Christian+century%3A++Liberal+Protestantism%2C+the+New+Deal%2C+and+the+origins+of+post+-war+American+politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Janson%2C+Michael+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The transboundary movement of hazardous and other waste, and international inequality: An analysis using Basel Convention, year 2000 data","While there is a growing body of literature examining social causes of environmental outcomes, there has been a dearth of quantitative analysis examining the movement of hazardous waste across national boundaries from a global perspective. In an attempt to shed light on this vital but relatively neglected realm, this study examines data collected in conjunction with the Basel Convention on the international flows of hazardous waste among countries (n=99) in the year 2000. The study examines characteristics of destination countries (n=52) as well as countries of origin (n=96) along several dimensions. Predictor variables were drawn from a number of perspectives including sociology, economics, geography, demography, network analysis, and human ecology. Multivariate statistical analysis indicates that while the higher the level of biohazard, the more likely a shipment is to travel from a richer to a poorer nation, nations tend to ship waste to nations that are proximal to them geographically. The classic world-system framework positing a core, semi-periphery and periphery is not particularly useful in explaining the findings in this study. However, the study does support a modified world-system theoretical framework, in which richer countries within a region tend to export waste to somewhat poorer countries in that same region (many of which may be in the same tier of the world-system). An ancillary finding is that, while in theory, the total amount of waste exported by all countries should equal the amount imported by all countries, there were some discrepancies in the numbers. The aggregate amount of waste reported imported by destination countries was greater by almost 42% than the aggregate amount of waste reported shipped by originating countries.

These new strategies, however, rarely extended to black people who were often subject to violence and discrimination in the period of high imperialism. Instead, when most reformers discussed the problems black people faced all they could offer were traditional promises of religious-based protections or ""uplift."" The violence of lynching in the 1890s forced reformers to address the problems of white supremacy in a direct fashion, while promoting an understanding of the connection between the plight of African peoples in the British Empire and the American South. The response to the widely publicized lynching of Henry Smith in Paris, Texas, on February 1, 1893, and the campaigns of the anti-lynching reformer Ida B. Wells introduced a discourse about political rights for black people and augmented traditional appeals to protections based on equality before God. This dissertation investigates how various metropolitan reformers---including Fabians, Positivists, and liberal humanists---not only discussed lynching, but also approached the issues of race and empire in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Meanwhile, a group of transnational black people---with African-American John E. Bruce at the center---began to form their own line of protest within this broader discourse. Culminating at the London Pan-African Conference of 1900, they constructed a call for immediate rights due to black people as subjects of the British Empire and as citizens of the United States. This appeal informed their transnational social movement that continued to shift the discussion away from passive protectionism and ""uplift"" strategies toward a more active voice of political empowerment that began to de-legitimize the colonial venture as untenable in post-emancipated societies. This activism laid the groundwork for later, more formalized, human rights discourse and informed subsequent calls for decolonization.",304827221,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith, Thomas E.SmithE.ThomasSmith, Thomas E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1251899151 , 35509811 , 66569 , 9780542994098 , 3243738 , 3243738", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780542994098, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304827221?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 History"," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 History"," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 History",," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 History"," Black history , European history , American history , History"," Social sciences , American , Black people , British Empire , Empire , Nineteenth century , Reform , Rights , Transnational , Twentieth century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reform+and+empire%3A+The+British+and++*American+transnational+search+for+the+rights+of+black+people+in+the+late+nineteenth+and+early+twentieth+centuries&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+Thomas+E.&amp;isbn=9780542994098&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Mattresses, folders and internally displaced persons: Towards an anthropology of “failure”","The Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs) problem area emerged as an international concern for institutions, governments and communities of experts in the mid 1990s.

As a result, Asian scholars have been inspired to promote the concepts of interdisciplinary and crossdisciplinary theory and practice, which relate to the lifespan physical activity of individuals with psychomotor limitations (Kobayashi et al., 2000). However, the number of adapted physical education (APE) graduate programs in Asian countries is very limited. Therefore, a number of students from various Asian countries enroll in APE degree programs at IHE in the USA America (Fujita, 2001). The purpose of this study was to describe and explain Asian international doctoral students' assimilation into APA graduate programs while attending PW-IHE within the Big Ten Conference. Participants were seven Asian international APA doctoral students. The theoretical framework was assimilation theory, which refers to a process of interpretation and fusion in which persons and groups acquire the memories, sentiments, and attitudes of other persons and groups and, by sharing and explaining their experiences and history, incorporate with them in a common cultural life (Park &amp; Burgess, 1969). This study used an explanatory (holistic) multiple case study design (Yin, 2003). The principle premise of case study method is to better understand some complex social phenomena---while retaining the holistic and meaningful particularities of real-life circumstances (Yin, 2003). Data were collected using (a) a modified demographic questionnaire, Doctoral Education and Career Preparation (DECP; Golde &amp; Dore, 2001) survey; (b) face-to-face interviews (Yin, 2003); and (c) academic program of study from each participant. Interview data were analyzed using constant comparative analysis (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967), which involves systematically examining and refining variations in emergent themes. The basic strategy of this analysis process is to do what its name implies---constantly compare. The researcher begins with a particular incident from an interview, program of study, and demographic questionnaire, for example to compare these data with other content in the same set of data or in another set (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967). Findings were presented descriptively in narrative as recurring themes. These recurring themes were: (a) academic experiences, (b) relationships, (c) barriers, and (d) identity, political, cultural, and diversity awareness. Implications of these findings are described for APA professional development programs.",304831583,,Dissertations & Theses," Sato, TakahiroSatoTakahiroSato, Takahiro",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1273138731 , 35855651 , 66569 , 3247944 , 3247944", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304831583?accountid=14496," 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education , 0745 Higher education"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education , 0745 Higher education"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education , 0745 Higher education",," 0282 Bilingual education , 0282 Multicultural education , 0745 Higher education"," Bilingual education , Multicultural education , Higher education"," Education , Adapted physical activity , Asian , Assimilation , Big Ten , Doctoral students , Graduate programs , International students , Predominantly White",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Asian+international+doctoral+students%27+assimilation+into+adapted+physical+activity+graduate+programs+while+attending+predominantly+White+institutions+of+higher+education+within+the+Big+Ten+Conference&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sato%2C+Takahiro&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“With our hearts in our hands and our hands in the soil”: Aztlán as utopic space in Chicana /o art and visual culture,"This project traces the multiple strains of Aztlán, the legendary homeland of the Aztecs, in hopes of maintaining the global anti-colonial trajectory of the late-1960s. By understanding the nuances of Aztlán, this dissertation will facilitate a more complex awareness of the movimiento chicano, as well as other self-determining social movements. Initially, indigenous elites conceptualized Aztlán as the homeland from whence the Mexica, one of the tribal units collectively known as the Aztecs, departed on their way to found their imperial home at Tenochtitlán (present-day Mexico City). According to many historians, Aztlán functioned in an ideological manner that legitimized the Mexica subjugation of other Nahuatl-speaking peoples in central Mexico. Following the foundation of the Aztec confederacy, Aztlán remained an important ideological construct for Mexica elites, but lost its meaning with the arrival of Spanish conquistadores in 1519, at which time it morphed into a dissimilar concept. Centuries thereafter during the late-1960s, in conjunction with the global movements of anti-colonialism and anti-capitalism, Chicana/o activists recuperated and reconfigured this ancient indigenous notion as a way to sanction and decriminalize their presence in the United States. For these young activists, the US Southwest was (and continues to be) Aztlán. But Aztlán is concurrently something more profound and abstract than a purely geographical place. As such, this dissertation investigates Aztlán as a hybrid site that combines both Indigenous Mesoamerican and European (both Hispanic and Anglophone) worldviews and perspectives. By exploring the artwork and visual culture produced by artists such as Gilbert ""Magú"" Luján, Malaquías Montoya, Nora Chapa Mendoza, Santa Barraza, the Xicano Development Center, and Carlos Cortéz Koyokuikatl, I demonstrate the multiplicity of functions that Aztlán performs. This project intends to recuperate Aztlán as a site of liberation, even for non-Latinas/os, while inserting Midwest Chicana/o cultural practices into the discussion. Secondary to these primary concerns are the critique of the false binary between Chicano nationalism and Chicana feminism, as well as the reciprocity between radical Chicana/o politics and anarchist direct action. Additionally, this dissertation issues a critique on double consciousness, mestiza consciousness, and biological discussions of cultural practices.",304838725,,Dissertations & Theses," Miner, Dylan A.

While this tradition had been previously characterized by rigidly hierarchical institutional structures, strong nationalist leanings, and authoritarian political tendencies, the experiences of dictatorship and defeat caused many Protestants to question their earlier beliefs. Motivated by the desire to overcome the burden of the Nazi past and by the opportunity to play a major role in postwar rebuilding efforts, several groups within the churches worked to reform Protestant social and political attitudes. As a result of their efforts, the churches came to play an important role in the ultimate success and stability of West German democracy. This study examines this transformation at the meetings of the German Protestant Kirchentag, one of the largest and most diverse postwar gatherings of Protestant laity. After situating the Kirchentag within the theological and political debates of the immediate postwar years, it focuses on changing understandings of the role of the church in society, the pluralization of Protestant political attitudes, and the shift from national to international self-understandings within the churches. It closes with the challenges posed to this new consensus by the youth revolt and the rise of New Left politics in the late 1960s. By examining the important role of the Kirchentag and of the Protestant churches in the democratization and political transformation of West Germany, this study asserts the continued relevance of religious categories of analysis in the Federal Republic. Focusing on the churches' landmark contributions—including the promotion of democratic political activity, work toward East-West reconciliation, and the peace movement—it also argues for a broader, more complex conceptualization of postwar political transformations. In particular, rather than focusing on the work of any one faction or movement within the churches, it highlights the constructive roles played by different groups with different priorities and motivations.",304839860,,Dissertations & Theses," Pearson, Benjamin CarlPearsonCarlBenjaminPearson, Benjamin Carl",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1441188291 , 38553511 , 66569 , 9780549324812 , 3289016 , 3289016", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549324812, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304839860?accountid=14496," 0330 Religious congregations , 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0330 Religious congregations , 0335 European history , 0582 History"," 0330 Religious congregations , 0335 European history , 0582 History",," 0330 Religious congregations , 0335 European history , 0582 History"," Religious congregations , European history , History"," Social sciences , Christianity , Democracy , Faith , Germany , Kirchentag , Politics , Protestantism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Faith+and+democracy%3A+Political+transformations+at+the+German+Protestant+Kirchentag%2C+1949%E2%80%931969&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pearson%2C+Benjamin+Carl&amp;isbn=9780549324812&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Pink dollars: Gay and lesbian film festivals and the economy of visibility,"This dissertation is about gay and lesbian film festivals, the first of which was founded in San Francisco in 1977 and subsequently served as a model for their international proliferation over the next thirty years. While the films programmed in these festivals have received a great deal of attention from scholars and critics, the festival institution itself has received less consideration. This dissertation narrates the history of gay and lesbian film festivals through an economic lens, asking how fundraising practices have been deployed in the community building projects of festivals, how the administrative structures of festivals as nonprofit organizations have been leveraged by the state toward the management of new social movements, and how these nonprofits have participated in the identification and cultivation of populations as niche markets by the commercial sector. This historical schema will offer an alternative model for understanding queer image production, not through a textual analysis of those images, but through an examination of the material circumstances of their circulation and distribution. This dissertation is not simply about the ways that community organizations like film festivals have been strategically engaged by the state and the market in the management and exploitation of gays and lesbians, it argues that gays and lesbians themselves have articulated their politics, artistic practice, and discourse of community within (and against) the parameters defined by the demands of organizational sustainability. Furthermore, this dissertation will illustrate why taking economic activity seriously as a part of the material practices of queer image production answers crucial questions about the ways that sexuality operates as a category of governance. The history of gay and lesbian film festivals, and their regulation through the administrative structures of the nonprofit sector, is part of a much larger history of political struggle and the development of new social movements over the past three decades.",304841294,,Dissertations & Theses," Rhyne, RaganRhyneRaganRhyne, Ragan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1267233661 , 35766191 , 66569 , 3247384 , 3247384", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304841294?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0323 American studies , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0323 American studies , 0900 Motion pictures",," 0323 American studies , 0900 Motion pictures"," American studies , Motion pictures"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Economy , Film festivals , Fundraising , Gay , Lesbian , Nonprofit organizations , Visibility",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pink+dollars%3A+Gay+and+lesbian+film+festivals+and+the+economy+of+visibility&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rhyne%2C+Ragan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Consuming anxieties: Rituals of acquisition, collection, and display in mid -twentieth century American culture","Focusing on the period stretching from the post-Depression era of the 1930s to the postwar culture of the 1950s, this project traces how the impulse to collect and display became a key element in the creation of new social formations, political movements, and aesthetic forms. The first half of this project deals with the political implications of an array of visual exhibitions; the second half examines how the acquisitive motive animates a range of literary representations that thematize the politics of collection and display. The eclectic body of works assembled here include the collaborative phototexts of Erskine Caldwell/Margaret Bourke-White, James Agee/Walker Evans, and Richard Wright/Edwin Rosskam; the depictions of the black body in the public imagery of Emmett Till's funeral and Edward Steichen's exhibition of photographs, ""The Family of Man""; Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison's ""underground"" collectors who seek to establish a sense of self and home in a hostile world; and Vladimir Nabokov and William Gaddis's examinations of how reproduction and reproduced objects function as conduits through which to explore the problem of history and inauthenticity. These works respond to the anxieties and desires generated by the epoch's dramatic cultural transformations by focusing on the tactile and textual as well as the poetic and political aspects of evocative objects and images, and by linking the logic of private phenomenological experience to the logics of collective and social life. As American society recovered from the Great Depression, established itself as a hegemonic force in the emergent cold war, and grappled with the political implications of the coalescent civil rights movement, these texts seek to transform material and visual commodities into ritual objects embodying unexpected, non-commercial meanings as they circulate between private and public, personal and political, and national and international contexts. Drawing on Emile Durkheim's conceptualization of ritual and Hannah Arendt's understanding of the aesthetics of political judgment, this project asserts that these works reflect the rising significance of private relationships to the matter of material culture in establishing a sense of spatial order, social connection, and temporal continuity in an increasingly chaotic and entropic world.",304843278,,Dissertations & Theses," Jacobs, ThomasJacobsThomasJacobs, Thomas",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1421606331 , 35766191 , 66569 , 9780549288930 , 3286484 , 3286484", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549288930, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304843278?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0591 American literature"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0591 American literature"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0591 American literature",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0591 American literature"," American studies , American history , American literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Collection , Culture , Display , Forgery , Material culture , Photography , Twentieth century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Consuming+anxieties%3A+Rituals+of+acquisition%2C+collection%2C+and+display+in+mid+-twentieth+century+American+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jacobs%2C+Thomas&amp;isbn=9780549288930&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Guided self -organizing particle systems for basic problem solving,"In recent years researchers have shown increasing interest in swarm intelligence as a promising approach to adaptive distributed problem solving. Swarm intelligence consists of techniques inspired by nature, especially social insects and aggregations of animals, and even human interactions. They are based on self-organization (a system's overall behavior emerges from the local interactions among its relatively simple components) and are often decentralized and massively distributed. Particle systems are an approach to swarm intelligence that focus on collective movements, and have been used successfully for applications such as computer animation in graphics and control of movements of autonomous robotic vehicle teams. However, particle system techniques have not been applied substantially to problem solving beyond merely collective navigational tasks. In this dissertation, I present an extension to particle systems that incorporates top-down, high-level control to self-organizing mobile agents, thereby guiding the self-organizing process and making it possible for particle systems to undertake problem solving directed by goal-oriented behavior while retaining their decentralized, local nature. This extended particle system approach is critically evaluated through three experimental studies that are adapted from well-known problems in multi-agent systems: search and collect, cooperative transport and logistics. The results provide evidence that extended particle systems are capable of exhibiting behavior important for distributed problem solving, such as cooperative sensing, division of labor, sharing of information, and developing global strategies through local interactions. They also show that aggregated movements can be utilized to create coordination at different levels and phases of the performance of a task, whether those include navigation or not, making extended particle systems a useful tool in the construction of adaptive distributed systems.",304844440,,Dissertations & Theses," Rodriguez, AlejandroRodriguezAlejandroRodriguez, Alejandro",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1328068321 , 36710861 , 66569 , 3260286 , 3260286", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304844440?accountid=14496," 0800 Artificial intelligence , 0984 Computer science"," 0800 Artificial intelligence , 0984 Computer science"," 0800 Artificial intelligence , 0984 Computer science",," 0800 Artificial intelligence , 0984 Computer science"," Artificial intelligence , Computer science"," Applied sciences , Problem-solving , Self-organizing particle , Swarm intelligence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Guided+self+-organizing+particle+systems+for+basic+problem+solving&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rodriguez%2C+Alejandro&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The effect of forced displacement on social life: The case of Darb es Sin in Lebanon, 2005","This thesis is a semi-autobiographical description of the social and economic effects of internal displacement and the movement of indigenous population within the boundaries of their nation.

The most recent Amnesty International Annual Report details violations in 149 countries. While there are no simple solutions to a problem of this magnitude and complexity, the support of powerful social groups can help in providing relief to the victims, pressure on abusive governments, legal consequences for abusers, and other resources in combating the violence that seems to chronically plague over our world. One of the most powerful groups, with tremendous social capital, is American evangelicals. Evangelicalism, even given the loose and informal organizational structures, is one of the few groups that has the global economic, demographic, political, social and moral capital to make a significant difference in the human rights scene. Yet the last 100 years have seen a widening disconnect between American evangelicals and formal human rights concepts and practice; these powerful American evangelicals have little presence or participation in the human rights movement. At best American evangelicals are oblivious to human rights; at worst, suspicious, even hostile. This study seeks to gain deeper understanding about the factors that contribute to this estrangement, or the disconnect. The problem of the disconnect naturally leads to consideration of whether what has been disconnected can be reconnected. Phenomenological interviews were used to gain understanding about the disconnect by clarifying what it means to ""do"" human rights by documenting the stories, personal commitments and professional activists of selected human rights professionals. Data was gathered from seven human rights professionals who participated in in-depth face-to-face interviews. The data from human rights respondents was compared and contrasted with the literature on American evangelicals to highlight factors in the disconnect and points of conceptual and practical overlap which could lead to a reconnect. The disconnect between American evangelicals and human rights is set in the larger sociological context of modernity, considering both its positive contributions in terms of human rights and freedom movements as well as contemporary Evangelical culture, as well as the fragmenting, alienating, disconnecting affects of modernity on individuals, communities and society. After reviewing the sociological analyses of modernity, the study provides an historical overview of American evangelicalism and human rights concepts and issues. The data is analyzed from a phenomenological perspective to gain understanding about the practice, key characteristics, formative experiences and worldviews of human rights professionals as compared with general characteristics and commitments of American evangelicals. From this analysis, factors which have contributed to the disconnect and suggestions for reconnecting American evangelicals and human rights emerged. Finally, the ethical perspective allows reflection on how American evangelicals should respond to human rights in a modern society.",304846476,,Dissertations & Theses," Stumpf, Amy Rachel TimmonsStumpfRachel TimmonsAmyStumpf, Amy Rachel Timmons",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1425291271 , 38303921 , 66569 , 9780549292852 , 3286900 , 3286900", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549292852, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304846476?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0626 Sociology"," Religion , American studies , Sociology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Evangelicals , Human rights , Modernity , Universal Declaration of Human Rights",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+of+the+relationship+between+American+evangelicals+and+human+rights&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stumpf%2C+Amy+Rachel+Timmons&amp;isbn=9780549292852&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Sound of the border: Music, identity, and politics of the Korean minority nationality in the People's Republic of China","This dissertation examines the relationship between music and the construction of identity among the Korean minority nationality ( Chaoxianzu ) in the People's Republic of China (PRC). The Korean minority nationality resides predominantly in the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, an area in northeast China that borders Russia and North Korea. Considering Yanbian as a borderland where creative and hybrid cultural forms are produced, I pay particular attention to the role of music and musicians in marking and reinforcing Chaoxianzu ethnic boundaries in post-1949 China. Since the establishment of the PRC in 1949, the central government has given minority nationalities the right to maintain and develop their own cultural practices and language. With the institution of this minority nationality policy, the Chaoxianzu have relied largely upon expressive cultures, such as music and the performing arts, to express and construct their identities. In navigating between two great social constraints, i.e., the communist ideology and the minority nationality policy, Chaoxianzu musicians transformed their ethnic music into a form unique to their diasporic community instead of presenting Korean music as it was executed in North and South Korea. From the 1980s to the present, the musical expression of Chaoxianzu identities has grown more diversified with the new emergence in China of global media, capitalism, cultural interactions, and labor migration movements. Given this new social and aesthetic reality, Chaoxianzu musicians continue to mediate between the expectation of presenting ""ethnically correct music"" and changing aesthetic dispositions among the musicians themselves and in their own communities. Shifting socio-political contexts condition the politics of identity by bringing changes in human consciousness, social structure, and cultural practices such as music. Investigating the construction of Chaoxianzu identity by tracing musical invention over the last fifty-five years in Yanbian, I argue that cultural identity is a subjective process, and that, in creating and performing music, the individual determines the kind of identity and the means of its construction. My study asserts that Chaoxianzu music has become a discursive space in which social and cultural identities are articulated and shaped.",304847194,,Dissertations & Theses," Koo, Sun HeeKooHeeSunKoo, Sun Hee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1428842601 , 37293801 , 66569 , 9780549320029 , 3288114 , 3288114", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549320029, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304847194?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0413 Music , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0413 Music , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0413 Music , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Music , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Chaoxianzu , China , Diaspora , Identity , Korean , Minority nationality , Music , Politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sound+of+the+border%3A++Music%2C+identity%2C+and+politics+of+the+Korean+minority+nationality+in+the+People%27s+Republic+of+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Koo%2C+Sun+Hee&amp;isbn=9780549320029&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Black migrants, citizenship and the transnational politics of race in postwar Britain","This dissertation examines the political implications of postwar black migration to Britain. Following World War II, unprecedented numbers of people of African descent migrated to Britain from the Caribbean colonies, exercising their claims to the rights of a transracial British citizenship status guaranteed under the provisions of the British Nationality Act of 1948. As a result of these postwar black migrations, during the 1950s and early 1960s the black population in Britain increased some tenfold, thereafter transforming existing racial dynamics. This study explores how race structured the experiences of black migrants and effectively precluded them from enjoying the full privileges and social entitlements of their British citizenship. To engage this issue, this dissertation pays particular attention to how instances of racial violence, namely the Notting Hill ""race riots"" of 1958 and the murder of Kelso Cochrane in 1959, served as critical events exposing glaring inconsistencies between the ideal of a transracial egalitarian British citizenship and the potent realities of socially sanctioned practices of racial discrimination in housing and employment, popular representations of black men as economic and sexual predators, racially motivated attacks on black citizens and the existence of a widespread climate of antipathy in regards to the increasing black presence in Britain. To be sure, all of these elements, informed by a broader imperial history of race-based economic exploitation, political exclusion and ocial marginalization, provided a context in which black migrants interpreted their second class citizenship status and consequently framed a grassroots black rights movement advocating police protection, greater regulation of organized racist campaigns, anti-discrimination legislation and opposition to migration restrictions designed to exclude black workers. I argue that in the process of making claims to British citizenship—through the very act of migration and by constructing and articulating a civil rights agenda—not only did black migrants contest and redefine ideas about race and British national identity, but more importantly, they participated in and were influenced by a transnational postwar dialogue on race, political rights, human rights, and the meaning of democracy. To demonstrate the complexity of the politics of race in postwar Britain, I situate the experiences of black migrants in Britain and the shifting racial dynamics prompted by postwar black migration within a broad transnational context that underscores the relationships engendered between local politics and racially charged international issues. In the postwar period, some of these issues included the emergence of the United Nations, the Cold War, decolonization, apartheid in South Africa, and the United States Civil Rights Movement. In doing so, this study highlights the extent to which the quest for black rights in postwar Britain was not simply a domestic affair, but rather represented a critical moment in the political history of the African Diaspora, interfacing the histories of people of African descent in Britain, the Caribbean, Africa and the United States.",304849083,,Dissertations & Theses," Perry, Kennetta HammondPerryHammondKennettaPerry, Kennetta Hammond",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1342728811 , 37018261 , 66569 , 9780549028529 , 3264214 , 3264214", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549028529, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304849083?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history"," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history"," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history",," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history"," Black history , European history"," Social sciences , African diaspora , Black migrants , Britain , Citizenship , Postwar , Race , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Black+migrants%2C+citizenship+and+the+transnational+politics+of+race+in+postwar+Britain&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perry%2C+Kennetta+Hammond&amp;isbn=9780549028529&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Stuck in go: The radical exclusion of ‘mobile women’ in twentieth-century United States literature,"This dissertation examines twentieth-century American cultural representations of itinerant women laborers, or ""mobile women,"" arguing that textual representations of migratory women provide a device for critiquing the relationship of woman to both home and work. The concept of (being at) home—in one's private residence, as a citizen in the homeland, in one's own body—resonates in discussions about the itinerant working-class female subject, whose labor not only estranges her from her own home, but leads her, as a domestic worker, a transnational migrant, a prostitute, into intimate knowledge of other houses, nations, and bodies. At once included and excluded, hers is the ideal position from which to examine the discourse of ""purity"" embedded in the discourses of class, national identity, and gender. An analysis of the cultural, historical, and economic significance of women's mobility in Western society is followed by four case studies that probe the uses of mobile women characters as narrative devices and political metaphors. Chapter One employs Theresa Serber Malkiel's The Diary of a Shirtwaist Striker (1910) to illustrate the links forged between ""foreign-ness"" and prostitution in times of increased national anxiety about immigration. Chapter Two builds on this link by analyzing the metaphorical significance of prostitution in Ken Loach's film, Bread and Roses (2000); the film's critical commentary on contemporary labor and immigration issues relies on uncritical assumptions about women's sex(ed) work. Chapter Three argues that the graphic scenes of poverty in Madeleine: An Autobiography (1919), a prostitute's anonymous memoir, ironically mimic the narrative conventions of the ""prostitute confessional"" to critique middle-class women's social purity campaigns of that era; the narrator's literal movement around the country metaphorically maps the relationship of a culture of consumption to a culture of gender exploitation. Chapter Four situates Jamaica Kincaid's Lucy: A Novel (1990) as an American working-class story, reading its ""mobile"" textual strategy of multiple meanings, free association, and shifting viewpoints as a critique of the latent imperialist, assimilative impulses in U.S. progressive political culture. Collectively, these case studies demonstrate how mobile women characters implicitly and explicitly challenge the limits and exclusions of labor and feminist movements.",304849732,,Dissertations & Theses," Nichols, JenniferNicholsJenniferNichols, Jennifer",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1417809071 , 37019861 , 66569 , 9780549239987 , 3282172 , 3282172", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549239987, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304849732?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature"," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature"," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature",," 0453 Womens studies , 0591 American literature"," Womens studies , American literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Immigration , Kincaid, Jamaica , Loach, Ken , Malkiel, Theresa Serber , Prostitution , Twentieth century , Women , Working class",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Stuck+in+go%3A++The+radical+exclusion+of+%E2%80%98mobile+women%E2%80%99%0Ain+twentieth-century+United+States+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nichols%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=9780549239987&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Under-mining Mayan resistance: The mining practices of Canadian corporations in Guatemala, their impacts &amp;amp; resistance","Currently the Canadian-U.S. company Glamis Gold Ltd., supported by the World Bank and the Canadian and Guatemalan governments, has established gold mining operations in the Mayan indigenous communities of Sipacapa and San Miguel Ixtahuacan in the department of San Marcos, located in Western Guatemala. The World Bank, the mining company, the Canadian and the Guatemalan governments frame this mining project as rural community sustainable development that will benefit the inhabitants of these communities. This project has been challenged nationally and internationally due to its failure to comply with basic human rights legislation, such as the Peace Accord on Indigenous People's Rights and the International Labour Organization's (ILO) Convention 169 on the Rights of Indigenous and Tribal Populations in independent countries. This convention establishes that communities must be consulted prior to the initiation of any development project that will impact upon indigenous peoples. In recent years, there has been strong resistance to the mining project on the part of indigenous communities in San Marcos, Guatemala who are challenging the lack of community consultations before the establishment of mining operations. Mayan communities are also voicing their concerns about the potential environmental, social, economic and cultural effects that this mining project is likely to bring. Drawing on fieldwork conducted in Guatemala during the months of July and August of 2005 this thesis analyzes the positions of Glamis Gold, and the Canadian and Guatemalan governments on the one hand, and the resistance of Mayan communities on the other. In analyzing the position of Glamis Gold Ltd. and the Canadian and Guatemalan governments, the thesis argues that international investments related to mining development projects in Guatemala have been directly linked to exploitation and violence, particularly since the 1960s and against indigenous peoples. This thesis also argues that Mayan resistance seeks recognition of cultural differences and thus challenges hegemonic definitions of nationhood. The Mayan struggles include self-government and collective use of land for the reproduction of indigenous identity, and directly undermine the neo-liberal drive towards privatization and individualization. This thesis' contribution is its unique analysis of current Mayan resistance to the Canadian-owned Marlin mining project. Drawing on Gramsci's theory of hegemony and counter-hegemony and social movements literature the thesis demonstrates how the current resistance is utilizing the national and international laws to promote alternatives proposals of development. This thesis also demonstrates that while innovative, Mayan leaders today are, as in the past, linking their struggles against international investment with their struggle for the preservation of their land, culture and identities.",304851739,,Dissertations & Theses," Godoy, Edgar SaulGodoySaulEdgarGodoy, Edgar Saul",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1441224451 , 38047821 , 66569 , 9780494338667 , MR33866 , MR33866", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780494338667, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304851739?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure,, 0700 Social structure, Social structure, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Under-mining+Mayan+resistance%3A++The+mining+practices+of+Canadian+corporations+in+Guatemala%2C+their+impacts+%26amp%3B+resistance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Godoy%2C+Edgar+Saul&amp;isbn=9780494338667&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Essays on monetary policy and liquidity effects,"My dissertation consists of three chapters that employ search theory to investigate monetary issues such as liquidity effects, exchange rate dynamics and private money. The first chapter of my dissertation models liquidity effects after a contractionary open market operation in a framework that highlights the frictions of limited participation in financial markets and search frictions in labor markets. It is shown that Lucas rigidities, with the aid of labor market rigidities, can generate more persistent liquidity effects under flexible prices. In addition, simulation results show that this adapted liquidity and labor search model can explain observed monetary dynamics in response to shocks of a plausible magnitude, and deliver substantial movements along a downward-sloping Beveridge curve. The second chapter of my dissertation proposes a dynamic general-equilibrium two-country model incorporating limited participation with labor market search as well as pricing-to-market. This framework is then applied to analyze the distributional effects of monetary policy shocks on real activities across countries and to account for exchange rate dynamics. Rather than focusing on monopolistic competition models with nominal rigidities, the qualitative and quantitative implications of this model for international liquidity effects and exchange rate behavior in a flexible-price environment are assessed. This sheds light on the international transmission of monetary policy and lends support to models that explain exchange rate dynamics with monetary fundamentals. The third chapter of my dissertation constructs a random-matching model with a clearinghouse and investigates the effects of private money on the volume of exchange, economic efficiency and social welfare in different monetary regimes. Under certain conditions, welfare in a monetary steady state with private money is strictly higher than that attained in a steady state in which bankers are prohibited from issuing private banknotes.",304857440,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, YanLiYanLi, Yan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1417811011 , 37416541 , 66569 , 9780549234470 , 3281379 , 3281379", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549234470, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304857440?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics," Economics , Monetary policy , Essays , Liquidity , Theory , Foreign exchange rates , Simulation , Labor market , Money , Studies"," Social sciences , Exchange rate dynamics , Labor market search , Liquidity effects , Monetary policy , Private money",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Essays+on+monetary+policy+and+liquidity+effects&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Yan&amp;isbn=9780549234470&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A cinematic dialogue between Nicaragua and Costa Rica: Shaping a transnational cinema through filmic exchanges,"This thesis focuses on the ways in which Costa Rican filmmakers and the Centro Costarricense de Producción Cinematográfica (CCPC) privileged the social documentary format of the New Latin American Cinema (NLAC) movement to critically view current events from 1973 to 1979.

This dissertation explores the confines of political Islam as a system of thought by analyzing the ideological formulations of Islamism and identifying its shortcomings in the context of today's regional and global conditions. It also explores the limitations of political Islam as a ""revolutionary"" force through an examination of the emergence of Islamist groups in Egypt (a secularist nationalist state) and Saudi Arabia (a conservative Islamic state). This involves explaining why contemporary Islamism has become so assertive and militant, and how regimes in both countries have responded to and overcome the Islamist challenge. The study demonstrates that the threat of an Islamist takeover in the Middle East is overstated and unrealistic despite the high profile militant activities of these groups. The study's timeframe covers the current period of Islamic revival, which began in the aftermath of the 1967 Arab-Israeli Six Day War to early 2006. The study found that Arab regimes have utilized various strategies of containment to confront the Islamist challenge. Egypt has used a combination of harsh repressive measures, the enlistment of international support, the adoption of religious themes and symbols, and for a while, the cooptation of mainstream Islamists. Saudi Arabia utilized a mix of closer cooperation and consultation with the ulama, the cooptation of non-violent Islamists, placating the Shia Islamist opposition, accommodation with modernists and the business elite, and intimidation, confrontation, and repression. The study also found that although both countries utilized the coercive power of the state to suppress the Islamist challenge, the Saudi response has been tempered significantly by cooptation and accommodation. Insofar as it has developed into a moderately successful social force, Islamism has still failed to achieve any of its political aspirations. In addition, the study found that certain intrinsic limitations of Islamism have also hindered its influence. The Islamists' vision of state and society is incompatible with today's realities and changed environment in the Middle East, making it too radical an alternative.",304860368,,Dissertations & Theses," Altamimi, Turki I.AltamimiI.TurkiAltamimi, Turki I.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1331399731 , 36828381 , 66569 , 3262373 , 3262373", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304860368?accountid=14496, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion, 0318 Religion,, 0318 Religion, Religion," Philosophy, religion and theology , Fundamentalism , Islam , Political Islam , Religious revival",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+Islam%3A++Emergence%2C+confrontation%2C+and+containment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Altamimi%2C+Turki+I.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“Quadrante” and the politicization of architectural discourse in fascist Italy,"Through a detailed study of the journal Quadrante and its circle of architects, critics, artists and patrons, this Ph.D. dissertation investigates the relationship between modern architecture and fascist political practices in Italy during Benito Mussolini's regime (1922-43).

It is a case study that examines how social ideas about modernity, health, and the body were translated into the built environment at a formative moment in Western urbanization. The first two chapters take a transnational perspective, with a survey of several urban centers (London, New York, Montreal). Chapter Three and Four focus in on Berlin as the central case study. The hygiene movement was deeply concerned with the built environment from its inception. Concepts of circulation and order were imbued with powerful health values, producing designs for the bathhouse that emphasized separation, regulation and a radically simplified space. Changing concepts of public life and the civic body shaped architectures of hygiene and inflected their decorative programs. A historical, spatial narrative of architecture and the body politic is opened up by a history of the bathhouse, which crosses Old World-New World, Historicist-Modernist, and Wilhelmine-Weimar boundaries. The substance of this research is drawn from previously unexamined archival and archaeological evidence from city bathhouses constructed in Berlin during the Wilhelmine period (Turmstrasse, Schillingsbrücke, Baerwaldstrasse, Dennowitzstrasse, Oderbergerstrasse and Gerichtstrasse Volksbadeanstalten), as well as the Weimar period (Mitte and Lichtenberg). The discussion of Weimar bathhouses includes a reading of Strandbad Wannsee (Martin Wagner, Richard Ermisch), Stoedieck and Poelzig's plans for the Thermenpalast (1929), and the graphic record of Heinrich Zille's Rund um's Freibad (1926). Critical perspectives rooted in the spatial politics of Lefebvre, Bourdieu, Benjamin, and Althusser help evaluate bathhouse architecture as a representational medium, a productive gadget, and a medical technology. The resulting history argues not only that social hygiene played different kinds of roles in the development of modern architecture, but also that changing concepts of the hygienic body generated diverse modes of interaction between the individual and the public sphere.",304862304,,Dissertations & Theses," Dillon, Jennifer ReedDillonReedJenniferDillon, Jennifer Reed",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1445355921 , 37705081 , 66569 , 9780549293675 , 3284095 , 3284095", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549293675, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304862304?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0335 European history , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0335 European history , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture",," 0335 European history , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," European history , Art history , Architecture"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Berlin , Germany , Modernity , Public bath , Sanitation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Modernity%2C+sanitation+and+the+public+bath%3A+Berlin%2C+1896%E2%80%931933%2C+as+archetype&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dillon%2C+Jennifer+Reed&amp;isbn=9780549293675&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Kate Millett and Jean -Jacques Lebel: Sexual outlaws in the intermedia borderlands of art and politics,"This dissertation argues for the historical importance of two understudied artists of the 1960s, and beyond: Kate Millett, an American radical feminist, and Jean-Jacques Lebel, a French anti-Algerian War activist who went on to lead in the student/worker movement of Paris 1968. Both are artists, writers, and theorists who critiqued prevailing morés and celebrated a morality of libertine sexuality. This study explores their multiple activities and the ways in which each linked cultural and political avant-gardes. In doing so it sheds light on the contributions of experimental artists and their international and interdisciplinary circles to broader social developments. This dissertation has a tripartite structure. Firstly, it is grounded on close examination of the art and writings of Millett and Lebel. Secondly, it presents a theoretical argument for the convergence of three tendencies that shaped politicized art in the 1960s: an insubordination inspired by Dada, an ethics of committed action reflecting philosophical Existentialism, and a utopic belief in the revolutionary potential of liberated sexuality. Thirdly, it gives a historical reading of the transnational cultural circles in which Lebel and Millett worked in order to consider the evolution of avant-garde intermedia, art that operates between traditional media. This dissertation concludes that, despite differences in perspective regarding gender, sexuality, and the means that these artists use to radicalize their audiences, Millett and Lebel had certain critical similarities that made them icons of the 1960s: artistic backgrounds, shared morality of dissent, and individual lives of committed acts. This theoretical and historical work contributes to the history of experimental art, especially of Fluxus and happenings, and enriches understanding of the foundational practices of much contemporary art as well as scholarship on the interrelationship of culture and politics.",304862342,,Dissertations & Theses," Fredrickson, Laurel JeanFredricksonJeanLaurelFredrickson, Laurel Jean",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1551264741 , 40301601 , 66569 , 9780549662082 , 3317711 , 3317711", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549662082, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304862342?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Algeria , Art , Art and politics , Art and sexuality , Feminist art , Lebel, Jean-Jacques , Millett, Kate , Nineteen 60s , Politics , Sexuality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Kate+Millett+and+Jean+-Jacques+Lebel%3A+Sexual+outlaws+in+the+intermedia+borderlands+of+art+and+politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fredrickson%2C+Laurel+Jean&amp;isbn=9780549662082&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"New media anxiety: Art history and the problem of modern technology,"New media forms intensify the effects of modern technology on both artistic production and its canonical scholarly reception. Indeed, advancements in computational technologies may have transcended the perspective of a mechanical era, ushering in new questions of aura and agency as regards new media versus high art. Both compelling and problematic for their largely military-industrial origins, electronics and the digital stretch the limits of art theory, criticism, and practice. This investigation considers the influence of modern technology upon contemporary artistic production, and how scholars assimilate that art into a cogent intellectual history. Chapter One introduces a historical context for the canonical reception of advanced technological media. Beginning with the problem of photography and its split nature as both a mechanical tool for 'scientific' observation and an expressive medium for an artist's unique vision, I identify the reverberations of this dualism on subsequent artistic movements and advanced technological forms. Surveying the reception of art and technology in the American academy, this chapter chiefly considers the significance of high art/low culture debates to prevailing canonical responses. Chapter Two brings the dimension of commercialism to this discussion, through an examination of its role in defining the artistic avant-garde. By analyzing the so-called collapse between aesthetic and commercial objects under the duress of capitalism, this writing elucidates the western canon's theoretical apprehensions around electronics and the digital. Chapter Two also considers the impact of postmodern identity politics and social reality of globalization, relative to the foregoing discussions. Chapter Three analyzes what ideological discord is stirred in the coming together of the socially-defined minority artist and media art, especially as it relates to global movements in contemporary production. Finally, it offers a model of embodied engagement with electronics and the digital that brings the intellectual vitality of new media studies to the rich legacy of art history. This exploration offers a language for art that is deeply engaged with media technologies, and a theoretical bridge that links the resources of recent new media scholarship with dominant western art historical discourses. In analyzing the anxious interface of art and technology, this work acknowledges their symbiotic relationship.",304865755,,Dissertations & Theses," Murray, SorayaMurraySorayaMurray, Soraya",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1303295951 , 36350661 , 66569 , 3254679 , 3254679", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304865755?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0708 Mass media , 0710 Educational software"," 0377 Art history , 0708 Mass media , 0710 Educational software"," 0377 Art history , 0708 Mass media , 0710 Educational software",," 0377 Art history , 0708 Mass media , 0710 Educational software"," Art history , Mass media , Educational software"," Communication and the arts , Education , Aesthetics , Anxiety , Art history , Media art , Modern technology , New media",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=New+media+anxiety%3A+Art+history+and+the+problem+of+modern+technology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Murray%2C+Soraya&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Give us this day our daily bread: The African American megachurch and Prosperity Theology,"This dissertation explores the simultaneous rise of megachurches and Prosperity Theology within the black church. Recognizing that the megachurch and Prosperity Theology represent two separate phenomena within contemporary religion, I also acknowledge the tendency to regard them as being synonymous. My research begins with an examination of the traditional African American church and pastor, and an exploration of the recent growth of megachurches within the black community. In an attempt to better understand the Prosperity Gospel, I evaluated it in comparison to the Social Gospel, discovering the similarities and differences between the two movements. Considering that there is no consensus as to how Prosperity Theology is defined, I examine the various ways in which it has been defined by African American megachurch pastors. In particular, I assess the ways in which Prosperity Theology represents an extension of the traditions of the black church and its emphasis on economic, social, and political empowerment. This dissertation compares the ministries of Dr. Creflo Dollar, Senior Pastor of Atlanta Georgia's World Changers Church International and Bishop Joseph W. Walker, III, Senior Pastor of Mount Zion Baptist Church in Nashville, Tennessee. Both are regarded as proponents of Prosperity Theology, however, they advance significantly different approaches to prosperity and Prosperity Theology. An examination of the teachings of Dr. Dollar and Bishop Walker indicate that Dr. Dollar's beliefs put him at odds with many traditionalists in the black church. In contrast, Bishop Walker's ministry more closely resembles that of a traditional African American church. These findings are further supported by the responses of their churches' members. The research conducted suggests that Prosperity Theology may be useful in facilitating the goals of economic, social, and political empowerment historically advocated by the black church.

Focusing especially on the last two decades of ballet culture as led by the two ballet companies in Korea, I undertake a feminist inquiry into ballet's globalization. I take a historical approach to ballet in Korea in order to trace many-layered meanings in accordance with social and political changes in different times and spaces. Additionally, the history of Korean ballet enables me not only to look at inner struggles in Korea but also to develop issues of colonial movement and appropriation of colonial power through ballet. I argue that Korean Ballet is a crucial channel through which Korean women experience the plurality of the postcolonial situation. Korean ballet provides a good example to acknowledge the ongoing complexity of women's oppression in global culture. In addition, I propose how Korean feminism has the potential to develop the blind spots of feminist research through ballet. The two Korean ballet companies which I pay attention to, the Korean National Ballet Theatre and the Universal Ballet, Company are leading groups that are charting a path toward the globalization of Korean ballet by exploring a Korean aesthetic using a Western form of dance. The incorporation of Korean cultural heritage and identity through ballet is regarded by Korean ballet directors and choreographers as a main tendency of the Koreanization of ballet in response to the globalization of ballet. I maintain that Koreanization can be understood as a form of resisting, struggling against or negotiating the homogenization of global culture by exploring a sort of difference or hybridity. However, it also reflects the predicament of contemporary women. Chapter One ""Walking onto a Stage: The Art of Dance Writing in the Age of Globalization"" introduces strategies and theoretical methodologies of my dissertation. Chapters Two and Three, ""Wandering: from the Past and to the Present"" provide a historical overview and background for Korean ballet. In Chapter Four, ""Dancing Desires: Narrating Filial Piety, Royalty, and Confucian Family,"" I examine choreographies of Korean ballets focusing on three full-length ballets: Prince Hodong (1988) and The Fantasy Ballet, Bary (1997) performed by KNB, and The Blind Man's Daughter, Shim Chung (1986) performed by UBC. Chapter 5 offers concluding remarks about women, the Koreanization of ballet, and the global stage.",304876343,,Dissertations & Theses," Roh, YoungjaeRohYoungjaeRoh, Youngjae",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1467888531 , 37473901 , 66569 , 9780549417897 , 3298251 , 3298251", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549417897, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304876343?accountid=14496, 0378 Dance, 0378 Dance, 0378 Dance,, 0378 Dance, Dance," Communication and the arts , Ballet , Choreography , Feminism , Feminism (women) , Globalization , Korea , Korean ballet , National identity , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Choreographing+local+and+global+discourses%3A++Ballet%2C+women%2C+and+national+identity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Roh%2C+Youngjae&amp;isbn=9780549417897&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""We are cool now…in &lt;i&gt;Hamara&lt;/i&gt; India: Bikinis, bike races and dancing bodies in the “age of globalization”","This dissertation studies dances and dancing bodies in popular Indian visual culture, to analyze the interaction between these productive bodies on the one hand, and macro processes of economic liberalization and ideological change in Indian politics, media systems and social-cultural life on the other. The study performs a close analysis of local-global styles of dancing and moving to understand how bodies reflect and produce larger processes of cultural change, and by comparing moving, reflective bodies in India today with older dance forms, traditions, post-colonial ideologies, political and psychological issues of nationalism and identity, global trends in beauty and bodies, economic and political structures of the visual culture industry in India, and other processes of globalization. In an attempt to understand how moving bodies produce emerging cultural ideologies, including those that re-define femininity and masculinity, this analysis includes a special look at historical strategies of patriarchal control and resistance in India that are unique to the country's culture, and political-social institutions. This includes an analysis of the exercise of patriarchal structures in the country including histories of nationalism and changing gender roles, the acts of compliance, resistance and indeed production enacted by bodies that constantly re-constitute themselves, ideologies that define the political-erotics of bodies, artistic/performative traditions in India, and emergent body movements and lifestyles that create possibilities for difference. The study also looks briefly at relationships and interactions between the country and its diasporic populations. It utilizes semiotic analyses of dancing bodies in filmic texts, including dances from Bollywood, diasporic cinema and music television, material from films, advertising and music videos, as well as analysis of live dances. The study suggests a theorization of the place and function of dance and dancing bodies in creating change, in re-defining gender, national and diasporic identity, in producing filmic pleasure for audiences, and in shaping, reflecting and creating ideological change for populations in flux.",304877143,,Dissertations & Theses," Nijhawan, AmitaNijhawanAmitaNijhawan, Amita",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1375514901 , 37473901 , 66569 , 9780549089919 , 3270451 , 3270451", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549089919, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304877143?accountid=14496," 0378 Dance , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0378 Dance , 0900 Motion pictures"," 0378 Dance , 0900 Motion pictures",," 0378 Dance , 0900 Motion pictures"," Dance , Motion pictures"," Communication and the arts , Bike races , Bikinis , Bollywood , Dancing , Diaspora , Globalization , India , Visual culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=We+are+cool+now%E2%80%A6in+Hamara+India%3A%0A+Bikinis%2C+bike+races+and+dancing+bodies+in+the+%E2%80%9Cage+of+globalization%E2%80%9D&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nijhawan%2C+Amita&amp;isbn=9780549089919&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Investigating &lt;i&gt;la frontera&lt;/i&gt;: Transnational space in contemporary Chicana/o and Mexican detective fiction,"""Investigating La Frontera"" is a transnational comparative project in which I argue that some Chicana/o and Mexican detective writers question and revise hegemonic definitions of ""crime"" and ""justice"" that criminalize Latinas/os on both sides of the U.S.-Mexico border through their representations of domestic, borderland, and university social spaces. I argue that frontera detective writers employ and revise the hard-boiled detective genre to uncover a history of larger systemic crimes against Latinas/os that ""official"" narratives neglect and/or erase. My analysis therefore shows how Chicana/o and Mexican detective writers use popular culture as a tool to criticize laws and other discourses that criminalize Latinas/os and to demonstrate how categories of class, race, gender, citizenship and sexuality complicate conceptions of justice and crime. My dissertation builds on the important scholarly work that studies Chicana/o and Mexican detective fiction separately, but I take a comparative approach in order to consider the linkages and disconnections between these two literatures. The crime investigation and the quest for justice in many of the texts I examine are predicated on the movement of characters across the U.S.-Mexico border, thus inviting the reader to examine how concepts of justice and criminality are embedded in U.S.-Mexico economic and social relations. I therefore read these detective texts in relation to economic policies that have displaced workers on a global scale as well as in relation to racist immigration laws and discourses that criminalize Latinas/os, vilify immigrant and migrant labor, disavow the histories of worker and student protest, facilitate nativist violence against undocumented workers, as well as perpetuate gender-based violence against women. The Chicana/o and Mexican detective texts that I examine in this project force a reexamination of official histories that marginalize Latinas/os based on their positions within domestic, borderland, and university spaces. In my analysis I identify parallels (in worker struggles and student protests) as well as differences between Chicanas/os and Mexicans in the U.S. (especially differences in citizenship, gender, class, and sexuality). These specificities are important because they show that Latinas/os are not a homogenous group even though they often participate in similar or common struggles against state racialization processes, exploitation, and oppression.",304877193,,Dissertations & Theses," Nunez, GabrielaNunezGabrielaNunez, Gabriela",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1472126351 , 39053941 , 66569 , 9780549286516 , 3286241 , 3286241", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549286516, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304877193?accountid=14496," 0298 Literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," 0298 Literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," 0298 Literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic Americans",," 0298 Literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," Literature , Latin American literature , American literature , Hispanic Americans"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Border studies , Chicana/o , Chicana/o literature , Detective fiction , Detective fiction - Mexican , Detective fiction - U.S. , Mexican , Mexican-Americans - intellectual life , Popular culture - Mexico,U.S. border region , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Investigating+la+frontera%3A+Transnational%0Aspace+in+contemporary+Chicana%2Fo+and+Mexican+detective+fiction&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nunez%2C+Gabriela&amp;isbn=9780549286516&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Coaxing capital, re -inventing the nation: Promoting foreign investment in neoliberal Nicaragua","This dissertation examines the social and cultural practices deployed to encourage, to promote, and to facilitate the movement of capital to Nicaragua by representatives of the country. Nicaragua is the second-poorest country in the Americas, with few natural resources and a tottering economy. Between 2002 and 2006, Nicaraguan leaders placed hopes for the country's recovery on the mobility of global capital, employing various strategies to persuade foreign investors to consider Nicaragua as a lucrative investment opportunity. I argue that promoting investment is less about actual foreign investment, and more about introducing a neoliberal capitalist imaginary that produces the nation-state in new ways. The project of this capitalist imaginary is to re-conceptualize the nation-state and its citizens as raw materials to be re-shaped and re-packaged in ways that complement the expectations of potential investors. Yet, this imaginary confronts the present of capitalism in Nicaragua, haunted by a non-capitalist past, and not easily made investment-friendly. In this dissertation, I examine the multiple ways in which this capitalist imaginary operates through the work of those who attempt to attract investment to Nicaragua, a marginal place in the global economy. My research examines the practices of subjects who have absorbed business management expert knowledge and are working to integrate these practices with the unruly object of Nicaragua, for the purpose of creating economic development. I examine their practices and how they seek to deploy them to transform Nicaragua. Through an ethnographic analysis of the work of Nicaragua's investment promotion agency, I examine the work of trying to re-make Nicaragua as compliant with the perceived needs of foreign investors and to create new imaginaries of Nicaragua. I argue that attention to the capitalist imaginaries in marginal places on the global stage shows the particular inversions, social practices, beliefs and practices that challenge monolithic representations of global capitalism.",304877343,,Dissertations & Theses," Hanson, Justine BirminghamHansonBirminghamJustineHanson, Justine Birmingham",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1390286611 , 36828731 , 66569 , 9780549148883 , 3274340 , 3274340", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549148883, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304877343?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Capitalism , Foreign investment , Globalization , Nation , Neoliberal , Nicaragua",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Coaxing+capital%2C+re+-inventing+the+nation%3A++Promoting+foreign+investment+in+neoliberal+Nicaragua&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hanson%2C+Justine+Birmingham&amp;isbn=9780549148883&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Political ecologies of genetic pollution and containment: Social resistance to agricultural biotechnology and the uneven governance of genetically engineered organisms,"This dissertation research provides an account of anti-genetic engineering activists' efforts to shape the regulation and containment of genetically engineered organisms (GEOs), examining the uneven power relations in mobilizations against three commodities and at the local, state, and national scales. Genetically engineered (GE) corn, GE salmon, and GE rice are compared to explain why some commodities receive more regulatory attention than others. This dissertation also explores several activist strategies for contesting the social and environmental dimensions of GEOs, including county GE-free zones, state regulations, federal and international containment policy, and consumer politics. Unveiling the political forces at work in shaping social movement efficacy and governance reveals how the social and environmental dimensions of GEOs are profoundly bound up in other political projects, such as changing trade regimes, agro-food system restructuring, declining public research funds.

Because journalistic decision making by corporate-owned media outlets is based on profit, many critical public interests and perspectives are ignored in news reporting. The result is a media marketplace that disenfranchises the voices of many progressive social justice groups like the Global Justice movement. This thesis examines the mainstream media and proposes how activist-designers can utilize their unique abilities to increase awareness and provoke social change through alternative forms of communication. The Fair Trade Multi-Media Project (FTMP) is a model based on the philosophy that visual communication is a powerfully persuasive tool that can catalyze a paradigm shift in awareness and public discourse. Additionally, advances in technology provide windows of opportunities to create alternative sources of communication that circumvent the corporate media establishment to better educate the public.

I examine the deferral of agency through the theoretical prism of the work of Jürgen Habermas, comparing and contrasting his approach with that of social movement theory, postmodernism, and ethnomethodology. I explore this apparent discrepancy through the analysis of the data provided by nine in-depth interviews, using the analysis of one interview as a template to compare and contrast the other eight respondents' accounts of the relationship between their concerns about global issues and their responses to them. My analysis suggests that significant factors influencing the deferral of agency in situations of potential action may include the individual's development of the capacity for independent moral judgment; the tendency to delay or defer decisions about whether to engage in political action under the complex, often uncertain conditions of modern life; the extent to which an individual's orientation towards such situations is characterized by existential or expressive, as opposed to goal-oriented (or instrumentally-rational ) value commitments; the existence of a personal connection with others who already are involved in efforts to address the problems the individual is concerned about; and the individual's biographical availability for involvement in such issues. Through a detailed analysis of the accounts which my respondents give of their decision-making processes with regard to situations of potential action, I explore the extent to which behavior that often appears to be non-rational behavior on the part of individual social actors can, under some interpretations of what actors say and do, be understood as rational. What makes that behavior rational is that, in terms of most of the data analyzed here, my respondents' exercise of political agency is not absent, but rather deferred; that is, my respondents appear to be no less ""active"" than those who already are participating in social movement organizations or activities, and thus already are committed to a particular mode of political involvement.",304888846,,Dissertations & Theses," Sukhov, Michael J.SukhovJ.MichaelSukhov, Michael J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1436354121 , 38045461 , 66569 , 9780549315384 , 3284485 , 3284485", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549315384, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304888846?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology",," 0344 Social research , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology , 0628 Families & family life , 0628 Personal relationships , 0628 Sociology"," Social research , Political science , Sociology , Families & family life , Personal relationships"," Social sciences , Activism , Agency , Critical theory , Deferred , Deferred agency , Habermas, Juergen , Participation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+activism+and+deferred+agency&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sukhov%2C+Michael+J.&amp;isbn=9780549315384&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Black atlas: Geography and scales of movement in African American literature,"This dissertation examines the literature as well as the social and geopolitical theory of a range of nineteenth-century African American authors writing between 1853-1900: William Wells Brown, Martin Delany, Pauline Hopkins, and Alice Moore Dunbar-Nelson. What unifies the authors in this collection is that they all used their literature as a theater for deliberation about the national landscape. They were sharply attentive to typologies of borderlands and the connection between geography and physical mobility. They also understood geography to be something textual, a discourse that reflected both privilege and exclusion. This study is built around several critical nineteenth-century flashpoints, which shaped national perceptions about the landscape and territoriality. These included antebellum abolitionism movements prior to the Civil War, United States attempts to accede Cuba for slavery throughout the decade of the 1850s, and Jim Crow mobilization in turn-of-the-century Boston. I also address the ways African American writers in the nineteenth century were deeply attuned to a question that has only more recently commanded the attention of contemporary cultural geographers and literary historians alike: the question of spatial scale and the ways it operates at manifold levels, from region and nation to wider diasporan spaces. William Wells Brown investigated the conflation of industrialization and planter politics in both the national Capitol and the capital of the Confederacy, Richmond, Virginia. Martin Delany devoted considerable sociological research to the theme of internal diasporas within the United and the transatlantic circuits of colonialism, from West Africa's Guinea Coast to Cuba. Pauline Hopkins fashioned a black public sphere within the urban geography of 1896 Boston, and Alice Dunbar-Nelson remapped the locales of late-century New Orleans to write a regionalism that was consciously creolite and transnational. Each of the authors opened the theme of landscape to new modes of textual experimentation. They offered ways to explore the often-inaccessible habitats, places, and people of the United States through their writings. They also revealed interconnections between shifting national orders and the idioms and voices that circulated within regional cultures.",304888890,,Dissertations & Theses," Irwin-Mulcahy, JudithIrwin-MulcahyJudithIrwin-Mulcahy, Judith",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1445035411 , 35766271 , 66569 , 9780549316312 , 3288747 , 3288747", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549316312, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304888890?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0366 Geography , 0591 American literature"," 0328 Black history , 0366 Geography , 0591 American literature"," 0328 Black history , 0366 Geography , 0591 American literature",," 0328 Black history , 0366 Geography , 0591 American literature"," Black history , Geography , American literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , African American literature , African-American , American studies , Brown, William Wells , Cultural geography , Delany, Martin , Dunbar-Nelson, Alice Moore , Geography , Hopkins, Pauline E. , Nineteenth century , Nineteenth century literature , Scales of movement , Transatlantic history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Black+atlas%3A+Geography+and+scales+of+movement+in+African+American+literature&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Irwin-Mulcahy%2C+Judith&amp;isbn=9780549316312&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""What went right: Political participation, state capacity and peaceful Islamic mobilization","This dissertation asks why are some states able to encourage peaceful Islamic mobilization and discourage violent Islamic mobilization while other states seemingly cannot. It contends that by providing channels for institutionalized participation, which may include elections, political parties, local and national legislatures and legislative alliances, states encourage peaceful Islamic mobilization. The majority of Islamist groups will react strategically and employ those channels as they work to achieve their goals. However, it is not sufficient for states to simply encourage peaceful mobilization; they must also discourage violence. States do this by maintaining effective capacity. They ensure law and order so that no lawless areas emerge where state authority cannot penetrate. Furthermore, they provide a measure of education, welfare and poverty relief. The combination of these two strategies enables the state to gain and maintain a measure of legitimacy. Furthermore, it limits the abilities of radical Islamist groups to make inroads, legitimacy and popularity gains by supplanting the state. When the states fail to provide either law and order or education and welfare, radical Islamist groups use state's lapses to gain recruits, popularity and legitimacy at the state's expense. Violent mobilization increases as a result. External forces, most notably, Afghan returnee organizations and international terror networks, use these lapses to exacerbate the violence already taking place. The dissertation draws upon the institutionalist, social movement, and state-centered theory literatures. It employs the comparative case study methodology to create structured-focused comparisons of three cases: Indonesia, Malaysia and Turkey and utilizes field research conducted in 2005 and 2006 in these three countries. Data collection methods included archival research, scholarly research, participant observation and over 70 interviews with scholars, party politicians, leaders of major Muslim organizations and ultraconservative Islamist groups, military officers, and international NGO observers.",304889512,,Dissertations & Theses," Chernov, JulieChernovJulieChernov, Julie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1296112421 , 36227351 , 66569 , 3256387 , 3256387", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304889512?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Indonesia , Islamic , Malaysia , Mobilization , Peaceful mobilization , Political participation , State capacity , Turkey",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=What+went+right%3A+Political+participation%2C+state+capacity+and+peaceful+Islamic+mobilization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chernov%2C+Julie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Transforming social conflict through an expanded theory of rhetoric,"This dissertation connects theories of rhetoric and composition with conflict resolution. It argues for an expanded role of rhetorical invention in negotiation and mediation by demonstrating how current resolution practices can benefit from theories of rhetorical invention and inquiry. Chapter One, ""Introduction: The Kairos of Investigating Rhetoric and Conflict Resolution,"" argues that an investigation is timely as current events and international relations are plagued by conflict. Chapter Two, ""Rhetoric and Conflict: Constructing Meaning through Rhetorical Invention,"" establishes the connection between rhetoric and conflict resolution by demonstrating how theories from classical and new rhetorics contribute to understandings of interpersonal conflict. I argue that four specific theories of rhetorical invention---critical, social, collaborative, and generative---contribute to conflict resolution by increasing opportunities for people to create meaning. Chapter Three, ""Improving Negotiation and Mediation through Rhetorical Invention,"" examines the relationship between integrative conflict practices and rhetorical invention. It enriches integrative negotiation strategies by demonstrating how rhetorical invention improves opportunities for constructive inquiry. I examine how specific negotiation and mediation practices utilize invention through various process and spatial considerations. Chapter Four, ""Beyond Conflict Resolution: Mediation as Means of Transformation,"" argues that a rhetorical approach to conflict resolution can improve current social practices. I argue that the recent articulations of transformative mediation can expand opportunities for invention. Based on a local community mediation center and a national transformative resolution program, this chapter demonstrates concrete applications for a rhetorical theory of conflict transformation. Chapter Five, ""Enhancing Pedagogy through Transformative Rhetorical Inquiry,"" argues for ""transformative rhetorical inquiry,"" an analytical method based on transformative concepts of information gathering, empowerment, recognition, pie expansion, and relationship building, can improve pedagogy and curriculum design. I apply these concepts to the University of Arizona Writing Program's Upper-Division-Curriculum-Review project of AY 2004-2005 and two curriculum designs I co-developed with peers. Chapter Six, ""Conclusion: The Future of Rhetoric and Conflict Transformation,"" argues that rhetoric and conflict resolution can improve current methods of inquiry and peace building by demonstrating how transformative rhetorical inquiry enables framing and reframing strategies relevant to activist rhetorics and social movement theories as well as collective ethos and community building.",304895381,,Dissertations & Theses," Juergensmeyer, Erik MarkstromJuergensmeyerMarkstromErikJuergensmeyer, Erik Markstrom",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1288668731 , 36107161 , 66569 , 3254697 , 3254697", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304895381?accountid=14496," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition",," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," Rhetoric , Composition"," Language, literature and linguistics , Conflict resolution , Mediation , Rhetoric , Social conflict",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transforming+social+conflict+through+an+expanded+theory+of+rhetoric&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Juergensmeyer%2C+Erik+Markstrom&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""&lt;i&gt;Miskitu takaia&lt;/i&gt;: Miskito identity and transformation, 1600–1979","This is a study of identity reformulation as adaptive strategy among the indigenous Miskito population of Nicaragua and Honduras from the time of their first European encounters in the early seventeenth century to their rebellion against the Sandinista state in the 1980s. Referred to here as ethnogenesis, the manner in which the Miskito repeatedly reinvented themselves in order to manipulate their position within an ethnic hierarchy shaped by competing British and Spanish and later United States and Nicaraguan colonial interests, reveals the Miskito's active role in their historical development and challenges static and historically Anglo-centric assumptions regarding the nature of Miskito identity. Research drew on multicultural perspectives derived from British as well as Spanish documentary sources. For the twentieth century, data was gleaned from oral history interviews and the author's more than three years on Nicaragua's Mosquito Coast. Interviews followed guidelines established by the Oral History Association and were in depth, open-ended and tape-recorded dialogues. Explored topics included education, political organization and social conditions among the Miskito between the 1950s and 1980s. This study found that Miskito identity, especially in terms of Miskito-Anglo relations, was more malleable than has been generally assumed. It found that Miskito leaders of the colonial as well as the national periods sought and gained regional benefit by adopting not just British but also Spanish structures of authority and that portrayals of the Miskito as Anglophile ignore intra-ethnic divisions and perspectives that reveal this history of Miskito-Spanish interaction. Oral history research discovered the same to be true of Miskito political mobilization in the twentieth century. Viewed as a single, albeit factious movement based on self-determination and resistance to Hispanic authority, twentieth-century Miskito activism actually began as an integrationist, civil rights movement operating within the international assimilationist ideology of indigenismo. While popular during its time, this early Miskito movement lost legitimacy by the end of the 1970s as the Miskito and indigenous peoples throughout the hemisphere rejected indigenista politics. As a new Miskito leadership emerged, the reformulated Miskito identity it projected required the silencing of the Miskito's earlier history of corroboration with the Hispanic state.",304895493,,Dissertations & Theses," Meringer, Eric RodrigoMeringerRodrigoEricMeringer, Eric Rodrigo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1467887851 , 36828901 , 66569 , 9780549309680 , 3287985 , 3287985", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549309680, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304895493?accountid=14496, 0336 Latin American history, 0336 Latin American history, 0336 Latin American history,, 0336 Latin American history, Latin American history," Social sciences , Ethnogenesis , Honduras , Identity , Miskito , Nicaragua",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Miskitu+takaia%3A+Miskito+identity+and+transformation%2C+1600%E2%80%931979&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Meringer%2C+Eric+Rodrigo&amp;isbn=9780549309680&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Post -9/11 rhetorical theory and composition pedagogy: Fostering trauma rhetorics as civic space,"Though a recent series in JAC (24:1&amp;2, 2004) featured special issue on Trauma and Rhetoric, little to no information is available in the Composition and Rhetoric field that provides instructors a writing curriculum by which to address social traumas. At the same time, only in the last several years has there been a noteworthy surge of theory and practice in the field calling for the inclusion of technology and visual rhetoric in composition production. Add to that lack of training available for teachers to maintain the knowledge to meet the growth of new media and its influences on current literacy demands and classroom practices, and these omissions constitute significant gaps in curriculum needs necessary for the 21st Century, post-9/11 writing classroom. Defining the needs of a post-9/11 writing student is a complicated process and requires a wide scope consideration of both ancient rhetorical traditions and contemporary composition pedagogies. This study uncovers the common characteristics of those traditions and pedagogies that best suit post-9/11 students by first considering the historic role linking rhetorical and composition education while explicitly concentrating on their shared function of teaching citizenry. Next, the text explores rhetorically resonant artifacts from WWII, The Vietnam War, and the Oklahoma City Bombing to indicate the shifts in literacy practices that seem to correlate with traumatic social events. The text triangulates Critical Theory, Culture Studies, and the Post-Process Movement to build a rhetorical theory and subsequent composition pedagogy based on three tenets: (1) the democratic values of traditional rhetorical education, (2) a complex citizenry that is both global- and cyber-responsible, and (3) the importance of multi-modal literacy. In the compilation of Post-9/11 Rhetorical Theory and Composition Pedagogy, it seemed sensible to describe the theory and pedagogy via three areas: literacy, rhetoric, and curriculum while also negotiating alternative production practices, teacher training, and assessment strategies. The result is a complex theory designed to utilize the intricate social and rhetorical situations derived from trauma events to provide students a commonplace by which to produce alternative compositions. Thereby, the theory and pedagogy developed here asks instructors to end the marginalization of students and their cultural and critical ability to engage in an advanced citizenry when met with trauma and rather to encourage them to be more involved in their education, their communities and their democracy.",304898245,,Dissertations & Theses," Murphy, Robin Marie MerrickMurphyMarie MerrickRobinMurphy, Robin Marie Merrick",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1317345451 , 36587501 , 66569 , 3260615 , 3260615", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007,, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304898245?accountid=14496," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition",," 0681 Rhetoric , 0681 Composition"," Rhetoric , Composition"," Language, literature and linguistics , Civic space , Composition pedagogy , Post-9/11 , Rhetorical theory , Trauma rhetorics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Post+-9%2F11+rhetorical+theory+and+composition+pedagogy%3A+Fostering+trauma+rhetorics+as+civic+space&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Murphy%2C+Robin+Marie+Merrick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Unearthing the underground: A study of radical activism in the Black Panther Party and the Black Liberation Army,"Using the prism of Black Power Studies, this dissertation explores the radical black underground as a vibrant and dynamic component of the black freedom struggle of the 1960s and 1970s in the United States. Although largely ignored by scholars and demonized by mainstream media, the radical black underground provided and received significant domestic and international support, across race and class lines, in the context of the overall struggle for social justice and equality. The clandestine nature of underground movements makes them difficult to study. Much of their structure, actions, membership, and history have been purposefully kept secret. While sonic narratives exist, and certain information can be gleaned from public statements, newspaper articles, declassified FBI files, and an examination of underground movements in other countries, a tremendous amount of work still needs to be done in order to unearth this neglected aspect of American history. Domestic armed struggle and underground movements have been ignored by conventional academia as part of its larger bias against the Black Power Movement. While often marginalized and criminalized, the radical black underground's efforts ushered in a greater degree of community control and power than had been achieved during the previous decade of civil rights. An examination of new methods and strategies of dissent, introduced by the radical black underground, further develops our understanding of the black freedom struggle. Originally articulated by Peniel Joseph, Black Power Studies raises critical issues that are imperative to understanding the complexity of the era and overcoming traditional academic biases.

Specifically, my dissertation examines how notions of gender equality, with its imagined possibilities of modern love and sexual freedom, are adopted into the lives of heterosexual couples residing in a government-designated migrant ""slum community"". I base this inquiry on ethnographic research utilizing participant-observations, interviews, and life history sessions with slum informants and their networks. To begin, I found that couples within the community accept gender equality as a new social value, one which is related to changing definitions of women's work, popular discourse influenced by the women's rights movement and Bangkok's high cost of living. Secondly, I found that ideals of how to marry and what marriage means are increasingly being linked to ideals of a middle-class consumerist lifestyle and moral propriety. A consequence is that persons with low-education levels and skills are effectively priced-out of marriage. Related to the rising costs of weddings is a third finding concerning slum women's desires to marry foreigners. These women perceive foreigners to be better marital prospects over local Thai men, because foreigners are imagined to be wealthier and more egalitarian partners. In a striking fashion, these attitudes - supported by my other findings namely contemporary conceptions of marriage as egalitarian and marriage as a form of upward mobility - are reflective of widening gender and class inequalities within Thai society. This third finding is also illustrative of how women, bolstered by a global awareness of alternative lifestyles, are strategically re-working the constraints upon them. I argue that these changes in marriage reflect ideological beliefs which obscure the issue of who can wed from one based on structural inequalities to one based on personal morality and national belonging. In sum, my dissertation details how traditional constructions of social difference, particularly gender and class, are perpetuated despite popular calls for equality. It contributes to theoretical discussions on globalization and the uneven articulation of capitalism within less-developed country contexts.",304901359,,Dissertations & Theses," Esara, PilapaEsaraPilapaEsara, Pilapa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1390286551 , 37704671 , 66569 , 9780549118992 , 3271972 , 3271972", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549118992, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304901359?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Bangkok , Class , Gender , Identity , Marriage , Societal change , Thailand",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Changing+marriage%2C+changing+society%3A+Contradictions+of+gender%2C++*class+and+identity+in+Bangkok%2C+Thailand&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Esara%2C+Pilapa&amp;isbn=9780549118992&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A Guatemalan tale of two wives: &lt;i&gt;Nawales&lt;/i&gt; (shapeshifters) in a time of genocide,"The motif of the nawal wife (a woman who shapeshifts into her animal other) appears in traditional tales among Mayan speakers in highland Guatemala. In context, such tales reveal the structural roots of violence in a society that is poised between post colonial oppression and globalization to reclaim the space of indigenous spirituality and effect political change. Racist ideologies at the national level constrain the scope of action of Maya peoples, yet practices of the everyday, such as tales, create degrees of consciousness and the will to work against violence. The movement flows from discursive possibility to life experience, working to change the conditions of possibility. The tales investigate transformation, the opening and foreclosure of social space, and consequent changes in meanings in the discourses of violence. In conversations between women from backgrounds as disparate as those as the indigena and the western feminist, the ritual destruction of a transformed wife frames issues of domestic violence and control of the power of women. During the civil war, la violencia, the metaphor of the naval reinforced ideals of the domestic interaction that would generate bodies in flesh and culture; tales also created a space to express grief. While the tellers and audience had an arena to address relationships within and between communities, they also explored the limits of resistance, mortality, and the fear that, to live, one might betray others and the self. Metaphors of the hidden and the covered, conflating land and the female body, carried a heavy burden in a landscape of disappearances, massacres, and the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Maya. Storytelling was itself a ritual to harness the power of the uncontrollable sacrifice that was taking place and to effect the structural changes that had to occur in its wake. Maya women and men have key ritual roles to assure smooth transitions of seasonal and life cycles within community and cosmos. When the whole structure (physical bodies, communal ethos, and memory) is threatened, powerful motifs such as the shapeshifting wife signal the distress of established orders. Female symbolic dominance emerges as socio-political change is imminent. The discursive appearance of the nawal wife signals an uncovering of force aligning with a historical cycle of resistance, of male military engagement, and of the political change that proceeds in Guatemala with the Pan-Maya movement and emergent Maya spirituality. This project has broad implications for the interpretation of traditional forms of discourse when working with communities stressed by violence and destruction. Metaphorical violence constrains social agency, especially for women, and frames actual perception. That metaphors can excuse violence must be addressed, given structural stresses within trans-national circuits of goods and people, tourism and labor in a global market. The space of the tale is an arena for non-accusatory discussion and reconciliation within communities, creating possibilities for coherent political action.",304901688,,Dissertations & Theses," Stone, Janferie JoyStoneJoyJanferieStone, Janferie Joy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1414118771 , 38123481 , 66569 , 9780549217770 , 3280646 , 3280646", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549217770, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304901688?accountid=14496," 0358 Folklore , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies"," 0358 Folklore , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies"," 0358 Folklore , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies",," 0358 Folklore , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies"," Folklore , Womens studies , Gender , Native Americans , Native studies"," Social sciences , Genocide , Guatemala , Mayan , Nawales , Shapeshifters , Wives",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Guatemalan+tale+of+two+wives%3A+Nawales+%28shapeshifters%29+in+a+time+of+genocide&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stone%2C+Janferie+Joy&amp;isbn=9780549217770&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Built to last: Preventing coalition breakdowns,"My dissertation research focuses on a labor community coalition between the Service Employees International Union and key organizations in the Independent Living Movement in California in the 1990's. This coalition was initially successful but eventually damaged relationships and failed to extend Labor's vision. In order to understand what went wrong, I construct a typology of coalitions and place this coalition within that typology. My typology differentiates coalitions according to the way they are structured. Who controls a coalition's agenda, and the degree of investment in relationship building are important distinguishing features in the structure of a coalition. I argue that those differences have major effects, particularly with regard to the impact of labor community coalitions on labor's agenda, and on labor's ability to form effective labor community coalitions in the future. In other words, a coalition's structure is of vital importance in Social Movement Unionism. It is not simply a matter of forming a coalition around the right issue, or a matter of having the right partners; most importantly it is a matter of having the right structure.",304902096,,Dissertations & Theses," May Rivas, Lynn InezMay RivasInezLynnMay Rivas, Lynn Inez",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1500060231 , 37952871 , 66569 , 9780549528920 , 3306248 , 3306248", Dissertation/Thesis, 2007, 9780549528920, English, English,,2007,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2007,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304902096?accountid=14496," 0626 Sociology , 0629 Labor relations"," 0626 Sociology , 0629 Labor relations"," 0626 Sociology , 0629 Labor relations",," 0626 Sociology , 0629 Labor relations"," Sociology , Labor relations"," Social sciences , CARE , Coalitions , Independent living movement , Labor movement , Service Employees International Union",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Built+to+last%3A++Preventing+coalition+breakdowns&amp;issn=&amp;date=2007-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=May+Rivas%2C+Lynn+Inez&amp;isbn=9780549528920&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"GUANGDONG SANDA INDUSTRIALIZATION SWOT ANALYSIS AND DEVELOPMENT OF STRATEGIC STUDIES,"Entering the 21st century, Sino-US, Sino-Thai representatives for a series of China-Sanda and foreign technical teams have settled in Guangdong, in the first operation of the commercial success of the initial formation of the Guangdong Sanda industry. In this paper, using a modern enterprise management analysis tool - SWOT analysis, the combination of expert interviews, data analysis, interpretation of research into methods of Guangdong Sanda industrialization of the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats to conduct a study of four, from the Guangdong local economic, and cultural management system to Sanda, Sanda level technical style start, and in-depth analysis of the impact of industrial development in Guangdong Sanda various factors. The results are as follows: 1. Unique geographical, cultural, economic, political factors create a market economy in Guangdong which has become China's most developed province, in this environment, Sanda industrialization of hardware such as stadiums, infrastructure, software, such as the emphasis on sports, Guangdong people's sense of innovation, and so on, which are extremely good for Sanda industrial production and development.In recent years, the home, the international high level Sanda sports event settled down frequently already may think that was in our country Sanda industrialization process a bold experiment, also had indicated the Sanda industry had the very good market prospect in Guangdong. 2. Guangdong Sanda industrial development is influenced by local characteristics from Guangdong, the sports management system and Sanda own, and some other problems. First, regional economic imbalances and the low level of social Sanda restricted Sanda industrial development in Guangdong Province in width and depth. Secondly, the existing sports system is constraining the industrialization of Guangdong Sanda bottleneck. From non-market institutional arrangements for the Sanda human resources, and competition issues such as resource monopolies have impeded the process of industrialization of Sanda. 3. In the situation that International and domestic sports industry are ascendant and the deep reform of Chinese sports system, the industrial development of the Guangdong Sanda system environment will be further optimized. And with the effects of the Olympic Games and the Asian Games, the influence of Guangdong sports consumption will be gradually warming, which has accelerated in the Pearl River Delta in Guangdong, led by industrial transition from the industrial to the service sector for the development of the industry Sanda ushered in the opportunity. 4. After joining the WTO, as the forefront of economically developed areas in Guangdong will lead to more intense competition in the market. Fenwick, martial arts and other sports, and entertainment projects in Guangdong Sanda the beaches will be the development of the industry formed a serious threat. Sanda technical style and the current instability, low level of commercial operation Sanda factors led to the industry itself is not so strong to the status of Guangdong Sanda industry how to respond to competition in the market raises difficult questions. 5. Overall, the development of the industry in Guangdong is Sanda advantages than disadvantages, and the opportunities outweigh the challenges. However, if the movement did not make good use of Sanda Guangdong this development platform, longing for change and strengthening the existing constraints Sanda resolve the core issue of industry (such as the management structure, competition mode, etc.), Guangdong Sanda industry will be faced with Muay Thai, Taekwondo martial arts kicked out of the market such as the domain, in the plight of being marginalized. In summary, I believe that can break the shackles of the traditional mode of operation so that the Government from the market operators as the changing role of the operator to carry out the macro-management Sanda industries, ""vigil"" location, the establishment of the support of the Government Shehuililiangban Match mainly operating systems and formulate policies for supporting industries, such as Sanda way to inspire social Office Sanda industry enthusiasm, promote the industrialization process of Guangdong Sanda; Secondly, the industrial development at the micro level, the timely introduction of Sanda may consider betting mechanism to create and use Sanda star effect and spread through the school, such as measures to improve the public and the relevance of Sanda, accelerate social and attract Sanda Sanda consumer groups; Once again, we must address viewers and the learners, and other consumer groups needs, and optimize Sanda technical characteristics, stable and developed in line with market demand Sanda contest rules; Finally, the combination of economic, social characteristics of the environment should be Sanda Guangdong Pearl River Delta region as a breakthrough in the industry, the establishment of strong domestic Sanda, large-scale commercial events, and rapidly grow in size and strength Guangdong led other areas of Sanda industrial development, a thriving industry development.",1026570219, 广东散打产业化SWOT分析及发展战略研究,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, Yu FeiChenFeiYuChen, Yu Fei陈飞宇",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2712764891 , 70541862 , 189128 , H240770 , H240770", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 广东散打产业化SWOT分析及发展战略研究,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026570219?accountid=14496, 0575 Kinesiology, 0575 Kinesiology, 0575 Kinesiology,, 0575 Kinesiology, Kinesiology," (UMI)AAIH240770 , Health and environmental sciences , Guangdong Sanda  Industrialization  SWOT analysis , SWOT分析 , 产业化 , 广东散打",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=GUANGDONG+SANDA+INDUSTRIALIZATION+SWOT+ANALYSIS+AND+DEVELOPMENT+OF+STRATEGIC+STUDIES&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Yu+Fei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The research of balanced treat way of labor dispute,"ABSTRACT The fifth plenary meeting of CCP delegate has put forward the demand of promoting social harmonious.

This great historical affair not only means the world socialism and international communist movements have fallen into a new low tide, but also extremely affected whole international structures and the trend of mankind social development. The viewpoints of representatives of different classes, different political groups and different trends of thought are various about such historical affair of great influence in world, and so are the academic circle. It is of great theoretical and realistic significance for the nations, parties and people being engaged in socialism, to continue researching the evolution and collapse of the former Soviet Union and pursuing the fundamental causes of the affair and get a beneficial lesson from that. Being in the right position and having scientific methods is necessary to study such complicated historical affair. Say totally, we should do the research work guided by Marxist world outlook and Marxist basic principles and methods. We also should differentiate main contradiction and secondary contradiction, stress the objective analysis of the main causes, seek the root of the evolution, and do a comparative study with reference to other socialist countries, in order to get some certain and regular conclusions. The Soviet Evolution caused by many factors, which can be generalized as realistic factors and historical factors, international factors and domestic factors, exterior and inner factors of the party, political, economic and social factors, and ethnologic and diplomatic factors. There are no controversies about this conclusion in academic circles. Now, the controversies focus on the source (or decisive factor, main reason, basic reason, key factor...etc.) of Soviet Evolution. There are three main kinds of viewpoints, which can be summarized as: the exterior factors, which means the western peaceful evolution strategy is the source; the historical factors, which means the errors and maladies of the Soviet socialist practice are the source; the realistic factors, which means the humane and democratic socialist reform route is the source. In these three kinds of factors, the former can be considered as the exterior factors, and the latter two is the inner. According to the fundamental principles of Marxist materialistic dialectics, the exterior factors are only the exterior conditions, although they have played a great role in the process of the thing’s development and variety. The inner factors are the basis. So, the western peaceful evolution strategies are not the decisive factors, although they have great influence on accelerating the process of the Soviet Evolution. We should look for the fundamental causes from the inner, the economic and social situations of the Soviet Union. There are many inner factors of the Soviet Evolution, which can be mainly generalized as the history factors and the realistic factors. Totally, the history factors just provide some possibilities and created some conditions for the Soviet Evolution. They are not decisive factors just like exterior factors. The decisive factors of the Soviet Evolution are the wrong reform line implemented by Gorbachev in his tenure. The essence of the humane and democratic socialist reform line is the total desertion of the Marxist basic principles and the socialist road. Because of this transformation of the reform, the consequences of the failure of the socialism and the disaggregation of united Soviet Union are inevitable. If we can say that the soviet reform is an unsuccessful type because of serious mistakes having been made in the reform, we can consider China and other socialist countries’ reform as a successful type because of their having correctly handled key problems of the reform. The bridge that helped the Soviet Union from socialism back to capitalism is the humane and democratic socialism, which can be seen clearly in the process of the evolution and collapse of the former Soviet Union. The process of the Soviet Evolution is that of gradual fulfillment and final bankruptcy of the humane and democratic socialism. The Soviet Union social system had already been changed towards capitalism after the 19th representative conference convoked in June of 1988, because the parliament democracy, multiparty politics and presidential system had been established from then on. After the event of “8.19”(the event happened on 19 in August), the Soviet Communist Party was dismissed and the Soviet Union was disaggregated soon. It is not occasional that the humane and democratic socialism can play such great role in the Soviet Evolution, because its theoretic foundations and the practical creeds completely deserted the Marxist basic principles. The humanism is one of the theoretic foundations of humane and democratic socialism. As a kind of criterion of the value judgment and a norm of behavior in ethical and moral field, the humanitarianism has great positive significance in the history of mankind civilization development. But Gorbachev did not regard the humanitarianism as a kind of ethic and moral concept, but the character of socialism, the target and impetus of the socialist reform. The socialism that he understood then is a kind of humane socialism and a process that carries out this kind of abstract value ideal. Considering the humanitarianism as the innate character of socialism, as the impetus to the mankind social development, is a kind of historical idealism and the desertion of the Marxist historical materialism. Alienation is another theoretic foundation of the humane and democratic socialism. Gorbachev believed that the socialist society existed the alienation phenomena. The soviet socialism, established by a certain and abstract theoretic mode, was a transformed “totalitarian socialism” which had been forced upon the people. So it created a kind of phenomena that rights of politics, political powers, ownership and culture was alienated from people. These phenomena seriously existed in each social field, such as economic field, political field and ideological field...etc. The “political monopoly” in the political field caused by the dictatorship of the proletariat leaded by communist party, the “economical monopoly” in the economical field caused by socialist public ownership of the means of production, and the “ideological monopoly” in the ideological economical caused by the guiding position of Marxism. For the sake of cancellation of the monopoly and alienation, the main task of the reform must implement “plurolism” in economic, political and ideological fields. It’s incorrect to think that socialism is the source of alienation. In fact, the socialism has eradicated the source of alienation. Advocating plurolism and attacking centralization of socialism was one of another theoretic proposition put forward by Gorbachev. He believed that the nature of human being should be independent and free, not restricted by any social relations, and the ideal society should conform to human nature. He also believed that each person, each rank of the social groups and each class not only had its own interests, but their interests was equal and independent in realistic socialist society. Therefore, the socialism society must implement the “plurolism”, namely, “political plurolism”, “economic plurolism” and “ideological plurolism” to adapt to the demands of realistic conditions. We admit that different people have different interests in socialist society, but it is absolutely wrong to make a conclusion just like Gorbachev that we must abandon the leadership of communist party in socialist regime, the leading position of socialist public ownership in the economical field, the guiding position of Marxism in the ideological field. If we can say that humanitarianism, alienation and plurolism were the theoretical foundations for Gorbachev to carry out domestic policies, we also can say that “the whole mankind interests is higher than any other thing” was the theoretical foundation for Gorbachev to carry out foreign policies. The opinion put forward by Gorbachev deducing from abstract humane principles that the whole mankind interests are higher than any other thing, namely, higher than each class, each race and each nation, is incorrect. The abstract, higher than any other thing common interests of the whole mankind do not exist in class society, although there are the common interests of whole mankind. Advocating this opinion indiscriminately resulted actually in the weakening of class interests, and desertion of Marxist class viewpoints and class analytical methods, and took great effects on the demilitarization of Soviet Communist ideology and meeting to the demands of “peace evolution” strategies launched by the west. Under the guiding by these theoretical principals above, the practical guiding principles of the humane and democratic socialism had been formed gradually in the process of reform. Summarily, the political guiding principles meant canceling the leadership of communist party to implement multiparty elections, abandoning the dictatorship of the proletariat to carry out civil democracy, changing fundamentally the nature of communist party in accordance with the social democratic party; the economic guiding principles meant the thorough privatization of public-owned enterprises to carrying out capitalist economy market; the ideological guiding principles meant the thorough denial of the Marxist leading position in ideological field; the foreign guiding principles meant the humanism and the non-ideology of international relations, the denial of confrontation between socialism and capitalism to fulfill the integration of these two systems. The Soviet Evolution means the first socialist country in the world turned back to the ages of capitalism again, after practicing the socialist system more than 70 years. It’s a peaceful restoration of the capitalist system in essence. It did not mean the failure of socialism and did not change the general trend of historical development of mankind, although the world socialist movements reenter into a new low tide from then on. The historical lessons drawn from the Soviet Evolution are various. The key is two: one the one hand,	the socialism needs reform. Non-reform is a dead road. It’s necessary to eliminate contradictions and problems in the socialist practices continuously by reform in order to perfect and develop socialism system; On the other hand, socialist reform must adhere to socialism with no vacillation, and never abandon the Marxist basic principles.

The experiment, no matter it is a success or failure, takes an important part in the history of socialist thoughts as well as international communist movement, and especially for our socialist development, it has a significant meaning of illumination and promotion. Before the 1970s in China, the experience of Yugoslavia had been treated as the synonymy of modern revisionism and restoration of capitalism, and Tito was animadverted on as a revisionist. However, the case has passed and the experience of Yugoslavia has been a focus of attention for some scholars in China. What features does the Yugoslav revolution have led by Tito? What role did Tito play in the Political Quarrel between Yugoslavia and the U.S.S.R.? How about the creation and development of Yugoslav self-management during the age of Tito? Why and how did Tito construct the Party? How about the creation and development of nonalignment diplomatic policy? What position should the thought of socialist self-management of Titoism hold in the history of Marxism? All the issues have always been worthy of lucubrating. The paper has responded to these issues, based on the abundant historical documents and using the relevant research fruits home amd abroad for reference; it takes the thoughts and practices of Tito as the basic clue , studies the socialist revolution, construction and reform led by Tito of Yugoslavia and sums up the experience and lesson, trying to show the historical truth of the Yugoslav socialist revolution and construction, and evaluate what historical part and position the thoughts and practices of the socialist revolution, construction and reform led by Tito of Yugoslavia take in the history of socialist thoughts and international communist movement. Tito experienced a legend from a plebeian to a revolutionary leader; adversity trained his characteristics of independence and tenacity; the work of Underground Party developed his predominant ability of organizing and leading. He built the Communist Party of Yugoslavia into a party with Lenin style, led it to prepare actively for the war, led the Yugoslav liberation War and socialist revolution, and created a new and outstanding history of New Yugoslav Socialism. Even more, Yugoslav revolution led by the Communist Party of Yugoslavia of Tito did not follow the model of the Russian revolution completely, but developed the useful and discarded the useless, which realized the social reform in the liberation war of the nation, achieved the success of socialist revolution, and prepared for the later self-management experiment. In the June of 1948, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia was expelled from Cominform, and the break with the Soviet Union burst out into open, both of which were the first division in the history of international communist movement since the Communist Party came into power. After that, the Communist Parties of U.S.S.R. and other countries carried out a furious movement to blame on the Communist Party of Yugoslavia led by Tito. In the break with the Soviet Union, he fought for the independence and equality of Yugoslavia and the Communist Party, in spite of the powerful hegemony. Confronted with the political isolation, economic blockade, military menace caused by the Soviet Union and other Eastern-European countries, Tito adjusted the interior and diplomatic policies to search for the way of surviving and developing without doing any harm to the national independence and socialist construction achievements, so that he created a new path for socialist development according to the situation of Yugoslavia. The Political Quarrel between Yugoslavia and the U.S.S.R. and the break-up with the Soviet Union caused the Yugoslav reform led by Tito. In 1950, Yugoslavia took the lead to implement worker’s self-management in the economic field, which turned on the course of Yugoslav socialist self-management; later in the social field, he carried out the social self-management , and established the commune system to develop local self-management; in the 1960s, the Communist Party of Yugoslavia led by Tito implemented the economic and federal system reform, and advocated democracy of political life, certainly with crisis as well. In the 1970s, the associated labour self-management system based on the self-management agreement and social compacts came into effect and the delegational system made some progress, a new form of pure democracy of socialism. Meanwhile, the paper also focuses on Tito’s thoughts and practices of the Party construction as well as nonalignment diplomatic policy in the course of Yugoslav self-management. All these reforms, from the various aspects of economy, politics and thoughts, broke through the Soviet model to a large degree. The study on the socialist self-management thought of Titoism from the view of the history of Marxism development is another important aspect of the paper. The historical meaning of the socialist self-management of Yugoslavia is that it put forward theoretically the issue of proletariat self-management again, based on which the self-management criticized the disadvantages of the Soviet model, and tried to realize proletariat self-management in practice, the socialist essence of Marxism, in the form of self-management construction. In conclusion, Yugoslavia noticed the differences between the socialism of Marxism and the socialist nations in reality earlier than others in the economic field, broke up the traditional bondage of mechanical antinomy between socialism and commodity economy, broke through the Soviet model in theory and practice. In 1950, Tito brought it forward that state ownership was the lowest level of socialist ownership and he protested that social ownership should take the place of state ownership. Early in the middle of 1950s, Tito adjusted the economic development strategy, changing the strategy with priority over heavy industry into the one over light industry and agriculture, both of which are essential for improving the living standards, which brought Yugoslavia into the range of middling developed countries in the late 1970s. In the political field, the democracy of socialist self-management led by Tito showed the characteristic of self-management of interest pluralism, and it was the peculiar form of proletariat dictatorship. Yugoslavia began earlier to divide party from government; in the aspect of the leading of the party and government, limited vote, rotation system, limited concurrent system, and the system of the group leadership were put into practice. In the diplomatic field, Tito is the founder of non-aligned theory, and he has made great contribution to the worldwide Non-Aligned Movement. Certainly, there had been various conflicts and disadvantages in the process of socialist construction and Yugoslav reform, and the Communist Party of Yugoslavia led by Tito pointed them out and tried to solve them. Although, they didn’t fulfill the target, they put the problems forward anyway. After Tito had passed away, the Yugoslav economy met a lot of trouble, with the increasingly intensive inflation, a large number of foreign loans and serious unemployment; politically, the League of Communists of Yugoslavia had a strong tendency for federalization, which resulted in the break-up of the League, changing into social democratic parties and implementing democratic socialism and multi-party election, and even more some republican countries of Leagues of Communists lost their regimes; at the same time, the national problems arose one after another with various perplexing exterior causes, which led to the disintegration of Yugoslavia. The paper holds the point that we cannot attribute the disintegration of Yugoslavia simply to socialist self-management experiment, and we should also take into consideration the influence of national separatism home and abroad and the peaceful evolution of western countries. The innovations of the paper are shown in the aspects as follow: Firstly, it is the innovation of the subject. For the current study on Tito, there are some biography readings rather than the scientific study on Tito’s thoughts and practices. The feature and innovation of the paper lie in, on the one hand, studying the history of socialist self-management of Yugoslavia by the development of Tito’s thoughts and practices, on the other hand, studying the important position of Titoism in the history of Marxism from the view of thought history, which is a new angel. Secondly, the paper makes use of many new documents. The “new” here means two points. One is that the paper uses the decipherment archives of the Soviet Union, Eastern European and western countries. Although some scholars have already employed them, the views will be different because of the different study angel. The other is that the paper tries to revert to the original history, and make a comment and analysis of various viewpoints, with the newest foreign research achievements on the subject for reference. Further more, the paper does a historical textual research on some vague opinions in order to get a clear idea about the historical date of the start and development of socialist self-management of Yugoslavia. For example, the paper has a historical textual research on the start time of “social self-management”, and finds that it is not after the 1963 of constitutional reform as some scholars have pointed out, but after the 1953 of fundamental law. At last, the author puts forward her own scientific views, based on the precise and objective study and historical analysis of Tito and his socialist self-management model with distinctive features, and thus a normative degree paper has come into being in order to memorize Tito, the distinguished proletariat leader.",1026919953, 铁托与南斯拉夫社会主义自治研究,Dissertations & Theses," Gu, Hong YaGuYaHongGu, Hong Ya谷亚红",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715045801 , 70534732 , 189128 , H336273 , H336273", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 铁托与南斯拉夫社会主义自治研究,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026919953?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIH336273 , Social sciences , #8226 , Jisop Broz Tito , Marxism , Titoism , social self-management , worker’s self-management , 工人自治 , 布罗兹&amp , 社会自治 , 约瑟普&amp , 铁托 , 铁托主义 , 马克思主义",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+Josip+Broz+Tito+and+Socialist+Self-management+in+Yugoslavia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gu%2C+Hong+Ya&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"On the Historical Types of Government Trust Relationship,"Overall academic research in government trust relationship remains scarce even though wide concerns have been given to human trust and government trust relationship in recent years. This dissertation takes historical types of government trust relationship as clue and makes a overall exploration to its form in different period and exposes the trend of it in the contemporary social transition with a goal of proposing a constructive project of a type of new government trust relationship. Historical types of government trust relationship is the basic frame of analysis, providing a method of properly analyzing the content and property of different government trust relationships in history, describing transitions from one type to another and providing a constructive project of government trust relationship in future. In contemporary times, we are in the transition from industrial society to post-industrial society, which can be apparently noticed in continual administrative reforms worldwide. All the countries are pursuing to construct a government suitable to post-industrialization. China is also encountered with the urgent task of constructing a new type of government in the tide of globalization even though it is in the transition of industrialization. In a sense, the proposal of construction of service government proves to open a historical process in conscious construction of new government, and its basic integration frame is government trust relationship. Therefore, in order to meet the need of constructing service government, research in government trust relationship itself is fundamental theoretical preparation and possible exploration. That is to say, proposal of constructing service government leads to urgent requirement of the research to the types of government trust relationship. This dissertation makes an exploration to government trust relationship in the frame of its historical types, a theoretical exploration in theoretical service of constructing service government. Historical types of government trust relationship is relevant to specific exploration to government trust relationship and of diachronically exploration to the evolution of political order and social order, of high importance to elaborate ethnical foundation of and new regulations for service government. “Trust” is understood in the vision of structuralism in the dissertation. It refers to systemic relationship structure and general social communication practice, and presents in specific time and space mutual adjustment between those that take action and institutions, and the relatively stable characteristics of such adjustment. Trust functions as the foundation and the result of social production and reproduction, and the media of the reproduction of the whole social system. Trust, as a structure should be investigated in different social types and in different social praxis under different time and space. And government trusts relationship, as an important part of social systemic integrity, is relevant to various regulations and resources when in function. Government trust relationship is the outcome of consolidation of relations in which various norms and resources are endowed with institutional properties, and proves to be the condition in which these properties is historically produced. The horizon composition, historical gathering and practical integrity of different formula and resources, constitute a framework that government trust relationship could take shape, i.e. the structural characteristics of it. Different types of government trust relationship present different structural characteristics. It has two meanings: government trust relationship is an action system in human communication, and also a functional social frame embedded in social system and social system; it presents the situation of mutual expectations and identification in human communications through different dimensions of social system. On such a foundation, social trust relationship and government relationship are established with a certain kind of mutual adjustability synchronically and diachronically, and the essential goal of the research on different types of government trust relationship is to propose a new project of constructing trust. In the early period of human society (social governance), social trust took its shape in familiarity, was deployed the dimension of common life and subjected to the norms of conventions and to the satisfaction of conventions. Therefore it was intuitive and sensuous, and thus can be called conventional trust relationship. In the social form of agriculture in which realms were integrated, trust in social life was guided by personality, behavior conventions and religion culture overwhelmed with traditions, and was constrained by awful authority, and because of these institutive factors spread into social system that was characterized by integrity of family and nation, and therefore there was conventional government trust relationship. Since modern time, industrial society has produced another kind of trust, i.e. contractual government trust relationship through its pursuit of ideal law order and legitimacy, with all aspects of the society overwhelmed by the conception of laws that became a general social trust relationship. In social transition of developed countries and in the double social transition of post-developed countries, we are encountered with social separations and uni-dimension trend of social life, and a new regulation-resource system relevant to social system should be reconstituted and a new government trust relationship, i. e. cooperative government trust relationship should be expected, a theoretical proposal as a result of focus investigation of social changes world wide. Cooperative government trust relationship proves to be a starting point from which future, and the ethnical essentials it contains represent a return to an ethnical society. Conventional government trust relationship existed in an integrated agricultural society or so called the etiquette and custom society, and had a strong empirical color. It relies on a general trust of political power political system, and was established by the expansion of the human trust relation to that between individual and system. The structural character of conventional government trust relationship is founded on natural economy and provides support to subordinate estate relationship. Conventional government trusts relationship took its shape spontaneously and steadily. However, when it functioned as a system of integrating government process, it established and strengthened subjects’ unilateral and subordinate submission to their king. In the evolution of conventional government trust relationship, the integer homogeneity of carriers of trust relationship developed gradually to heterogeneity and coercion, alienated to humanity in a degree. Apparently, conventional government trust relationship manifested itself differently in ancient China and western countries, with the kind in China as its characteristic form, while the kind in western countries falling into non-characteristic form. In the ancient agricultural society, “li” system stands as ethnical-psychological model and a series of regulations, constituting the fundamental content of conventional government trust relationship as its origin and essence, while Confucianism and relevant ceremonies function as inner constraint and outer guiding system. However, conventional government trust relationship existed in a weak state in Europe in the medieval time, lasted in a relatively short time, and failed to develop to the characteristic form as that in China, just as agriculture in Europe was not the characteristic form of agriculture. European society began its step to industrialization and urbanization in the 14th century, and contact began to develop rapidly as a new social composing factor, and conception of rights and duties have come into human’s idea. As far as trust relationship is concerned, contractual relationship has developed gradually to its shape and contractual government relationship has finally been established with the coming of industrial society and persistence of the Enlightenment. The collapse of acquaintance society and rise of stranger society are accompanied with the forming of market economy and shaping of nationalism (or dictatorship). In a sense, contract proves to be middle institute design of trust relationship between public and government with laws as its form and spirit of contract as its essence, and government and the whole social governance system strengthen consciously conception of contract and contractual order. All these constitute the establishment of contractual government trust relationship from skepticism to contractualism in the ideological design of social institutions and governing order and. It is an objective psychological guarantee system in view of psychology, is a result of utilitarian calculations, and an institutionally and structurally operative system in view of managerial science. The establishment of contractual trust relationship from conventional trust relationship turns out to be one aspect of human progress, with contractual government trust relationship providing guarantee to the realization of exchange justice. However, it ban be ascertained through theoretical analysis that contractual government trust relationship is somehow a kind of objectivated and formal trust, and the objectivation abstracts all the essential content of trust and renders it a kind of calculative trust relationship with mean rationality as its character and mutual benefit as its premise. Therefore, it is a historical challenge to transcend contractual government trust relationship and establish a new kind of government trust relationship in post-industrialization. The proposal of moral being and holistic analysis of human being can be considered as preparing a new foundation for the construction of a new series of regulation that our new life world, communicative model and relationship need, and also a starting point from which a new form of social governing design and a new government trust relationship is proposed and established. The exploration of “anticipation and reflection” method to social governance indicates that to transcend contractual government trust relationship is a process in which new social governance model replaces managerial social governance model and moral existence of human beings manifests itself that has suffocated by social institutions designed according to formal rationality. The construction of new government trust relationship that will prove to be cooperative government trust relationship and of new social governance is the same process. Because of the introduction of ethnical relation, cooperative government trust relationship is on one hand the persistence of authority order and laws order, and on other hand presence of new ethnical spirit with service and cooperation as its essential content, and also an appealing to an ethnical society with social cooperation and social autonomy. Cooperative government trust relationship is deeply rooted in the urgent need of post-industrialization, and conscious construction of the relationship has developed to a historical movement of reality urgent importance in reality. It has been witnessed that more and more new social factors in the social changes and social progresses since the later time of 20th century provide support to the construction of cooperative government trust relationship. For example, it is necessary and possible to consciously construct the relationship in the global movement breaking the center and margin structure in the world, in the development of non-governmental organizations and their active and constructive participation into social governance. China is in the double transition of industrialization and post-industrialization and there various irregular relationships functioning that result in frequent invalidation in social integration and regulation, and in latent legitimacy in the performance of public authority. Therefore, it is of particular urgency and high importance for China to consciously construct cooperative government trust relationship. Nowadays, constructing service government constitutes a historical chance and constraining government functions to macro-guide constitutes the premise of it.",1026922923, 论政府信任关系的历史类型,Dissertations & Theses," Cheng, QianChengQianCheng, Qian程倩",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715040581 , 70534552 , 189128 , H385689 , H385689", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 论政府信任关系的历史类型,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026922923?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAIH385689 , Social sciences , government trust relationship , the contractual trust relationship , the convention of government trust relationship , the cooperative government trust relationship , 习俗型 , 合作型 , 契约型 , 政府信任关系",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+Historical+Types+of+Government+Trust+Relationship&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cheng%2C+Qian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Comparative Study of the Socialism Development Values of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping,"Development is the eternal theme of human society. Development viewpoint to about total viewpoint and basic viewpoint of social development , instruct people carry on cardinal principle of social work. Dialectical materialism think what kind of development viewpoint does it have , what kind of development paths does it have. If development one boat that brave the wind and the waves, develop viewpoint to is it sail the steersman in the direction to administer. Whether a society could establish the correct development viewpoint , concerns the development that this society could be healthy , lasting , overall. So, it is essential to development and progress of the human society to develop the viewpoint. The socialist cause is mankind's brand-new undertaking. Persons who are regarded as the initiator and development of China's socialist cause of Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping respectively, in exploring that there is course of the development path of socialism with chinese characteristics, form two have close connection , have obvious socialism of difference develop the viewpoint. No matter Mao Zedong, or Deng Xiaoping, socialism is development viewpoint have abundant content very. But Mao Zedong socialism development viewpoint Mao Zedong Thought , Deng Xiaoping socialism develop viewpoint no Deng Xiaoping Theory after all, socialism develops the viewpoint just about the cardinal principle of the social development, can't attend to each and every aspect of a matter . So this text has just chosen the development path and development model in term of developing the viewpoint, developing stage , developing several respects , such as motive force and central task , development goal and strategic plan ,etc., socialism of great man develop viewpoint carry on comparative analysis , is it find out the difference of the two and get in touch to aim at to two. Because of this, whole logic structure of this text and main content are formed by five parts: First, theory resource and history , era background analyse This part compare Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping socialist development theory origin and different history , era background that viewpoint produce to analyse mainly. In Marx, Engels , Lenin , Stalin, there then , is it describe about socialist development system of viewpoint to have, no more successful experience about socialist construction either. So, Mao Zedong, with Deng Xiaoping when explore the Chinese socialism development problem, theory resource and successful socialist construction experience that can utilize are quite limited. The national conditions that Mao Zedong and Deng Xiaoping face are "" poor and underdeveloped "", have a large population, based on a weak economy. But the understanding of the national conditions is different. Mao Zedong regards "" poor and underdeveloped "" as the advantage , "" easy to write with the newest and most beautiful characters, easy to draw the newest and most beautiful picture "", have ignored socialist arduousness of developing, mistake of making "" left "" to incline and advance rashly in socialism is developed. Deng Xiaoping see "" have a large population , based on a weak economy "" unfavorable one side , is it develop socialist long period of time and arduousness to put emphasis on more, pay attention to doing solid work , looking for the truth and be practical further in developing. Era that Mao Zedong face theme"" war and revolution "", excessive to estimate that erupts the danger of the world war, have influenced the decision to the development strategy of Mao Zedong. Deng Xiaoping has held theme "" peace and development "" of the era at that time correctly, pay attention to developing further, safeguard the peace. Mao Zedong Times, the mainstream of the international communist movement is that eager to carry out the transition to communism producing the wind altogether prevails, Mao Zedong's "" catching up with and surpassing strategy "" is influenced by this and put forward. In Deng Xiaoping times, the reform is a mainstream of the international communist movement at that time, so, Deng Xiaoping regards reform and opening-up as the only way of China's social doctrine development. Second, about the development path and socialist development model This part of is analysis mainly compare Mao Zedong and the development road of the option of Deng Xiaoping and their two differences develop pattern. found country initial stage, China is basically in building have copied Soviet pattern. along with Soviet pattern abuse expose , Mao Zedong have put forward "" is warning with the Soviet Union, "" "" go to own road, "" thought, begin explore accord with the socialist development road of Chinese reality more, try hard breakthrough Soviet pattern. but because of Mao Zedong "" is left , "" incline the influence of thought, do not break through the planned pattern of economic system of high concentration eventually. Deng Xiaoping in summarize historical experience give the socialist road of Chinese characteristic a lesson foundation on, have put forward go have , have established the system of socialist market economy develop pattern, make the socialist construction of China have gone to the orbit of healthy development. Third, about developing stage of socialism This part of is analysis mainly compare Mao Zedong "" two stage theory "" with the socialist elementary stage theory of Deng Xiaoping content. Mao Zedong have put forward : socialism may divide into "" not developed socialism "" and "" more developed socialism "" two stages, our country is still in "" not developed socialism "" stage. reforming and opening up to the outside world after, Deng Xiaoping have gone on for the socialist located stage of our country know again, have put forward the theory of socialist elementary stage, have established "" a central, two basic points "" socialist elementary stage basic route. Fourth, about develop motive force and central task of socialism In socialism develop power aspect, Mao Zedong have put forward "" basic contradictory power theory "", point out the contradiction between production relation and productivity, superstructure and the contradiction between economic foundation is still the basic contradiction of socialist society, is promote socialist basic power. discuss according to basic contradictory power, have put forward the basic task of socialist society is "" protect and develop productivity, "". Deng Xiaoping in 11 classes of 3 in plenary after, have put forward "" reform power theory "", in reform production relation and superstructure the basic task of socialism and the abuse of obstruction productivity development is "" liberate and develop productivity "", reform is 2th Chinese revolutionary. Fifth, about the socialist development goal and strategic plan In socialism develop goal aspect, Mao Zedong have put forward realization 4 modern goals, realize industry, agriculture, defence and the modernization of science and technology . for realize this magnificent goal, Mao Zedong have again established "" two steps goes "" strategic deployment. Deng Xiaoping inherit and develop the thought of the 4 modern goals of Mao Zedong , have put forward "" become the construction of our country , is prosperous, democratic , civilized socialist modern country "" goal. for realize this goal, Deng Xiaoping put forward "" three steps goes "" strategic deployment. Deng Xiaoping develop goal and strategic deployment than strategic deployment and the goal of Mao Zedong more specific , more reality , more practical feasible.",1026923176, 毛泽东与邓小平社会主义发展观比较研究,Dissertations & Theses," Sun, You LanSunLanYouSun, You Lan孙兰友",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715038131 , 70534442 , 189128 , H389538 , H389538", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 毛泽东与邓小平社会主义发展观比较研究,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026923176?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIH389538 , Social sciences , Comparison , Deng Xiaoping , Development Value , Mao Zedong , 发展观 , 比较 , 毛泽东 , 邓小平",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Comparative+Study+of+the+Socialism%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A%0ADevelopment+Values+of+Mao+Zedong+and+Deng+Xiaoping&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sun%2C+You+Lan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The forming, development and reform of China's contemporary political system","The full text including six chapters, take the Marxism historical materialism as the instructions, the China political system historical development process has carried on the comprehensive review since to the founding of the nation, has discussed the Contemporary China political system formation, the successional variation process and its the experience lesson with emphasis, to has carried on the summary and the summary in the different stage political system characteristic; This article pays attention from the Contemporary China political system forms with in the evolution history analyzes its structure, the function and the movement mechanism, in evaluation political system some diseases and the origin, since has promulgated the founding of the nation the Contemporary China political system development change historical process, the characteristic and the law of development; Since to party's 11 session of Third Session, the mammoth political reform which Contemporary China has carried on carries on has combed, the induction and the summary.

In 1949 Political Consultative Conference plenary session through ""Common program"", is the legal standard, which the early years of the new nation whole nation observes together. It explicitly stipulates the National People's Congress for our country's highest administrative organization. At that time because held the general election the National People's Congress condition not to be mature, temporarily by Political Consultative Conference plenary session acting its authority. New China political system several main categories although at the beginning of young, but all has the quite obvious transition nature. The political system adopts the leadership way, the method, are with the transition period historical characteristic, which transforms to the socialism adapts by new democracy, is correct. It had reflected the party to the state power and society's leading role, as well as the party and the national all levels of political power organization, in various social group respective work movement basically can achieve performs its own functions, had guaranteed the domestic politics stability, promoted the social productive forces development. From September, 1954 the first session of National People's Congress to September, 1956, was the Contemporary China political system forms the time initially. First ""People's Republic of China Constitution"" by the basic big method form, national nature, to the socialism transition policy step, the state institution, people's democratic right and the duty and so on the major issue explicitly stipulated, the specially explicit affirmation our country society has been experiencing the socialism great transformation, indicated our country to move towards the socialism the prospect and the political system socialism essence. This time political system structure and function quite suitably in processing at that time domestic massive existences class struggle question and solution transition period social principal contradiction. It with this time society politics, the economical development condition adapts, effectively impelled the national economy national economy restoration and each society democratic reform carrying on, had guaranteed the large-scale economic development launches and the socialist transformation basically completes, regarding smoothly realizes our country society by new democracy to the socialism transformation, played the vital role. Because party's unified leadership principle not makes in the practical work to the party and the government and other organizations' within the job duties is clear about divides, thus some party committees worked the department and government department's party group have managed some business scopes matters; The party committee discussion and the decision government service important question, the varying degree development for the party committee direct management government service, and so on, these questions negative effects will reveal day by day in later. This time, the Central Party Committee, Mao Zedong proposed at that time reforms and consummates our country political system under the socialism condition some basic conception, started the exploration to reform and to consummate our country political system the course. Third chapter, Contemporary China political system in exploration winding development (in September, 1956-April, 1966). Basically completes along with the producer goods private ownership socialist transformation, the domestic principal contradiction already no longer was between the working class and bourgeoisie's contradiction. From this time on, the national primary mission changes the economy, politics, and the culture by the large-scale class struggle and so on each aspect construction. This request political system implementation switcher trading, will rule the function primarily to shift to the social management function primarily track, namely the strengthening political system management economy, cultural and the social public affairs function, by will adapt the diverse social life and the various construction enterprise need. However, 1957 counter- right movement changed the development direction with ""the Great Leap Forward"" which prearranges, causes our country political system construction in to be winding difficultly marches forward. After 1957, Mao Zedong changed eight critical junctions in the domestic principal contradiction conclusion, mentioned again the proletariat and bourgeoisie's contradiction is the principal contradiction, and proposed must continue to carry on the socialism the political revolution and the thought revolution. In under this kind of theory instruction, the state form social management function has not risen to the main status. But while ""the Great Leap Forward"" the movement development, was has formed the highly unified direction and the management system, the political system had the authority over-concentration tendency. On June 10, 1958,The Central Committee of the CCP sends out ""about Establishment Finance and economics, Politics and law, External affair, Science, Culture and education Various Groups' Notice"" symbolized finally establishes by the party generation of politics political system. In 1960 the second half-year, the party started to correct ""is left"" leans the mistake, to national economy national economy implementation adjustment. At the same time has also carried on certain adjustments to the political life aspect. But as a result of historical limitation, but also does not have to be able fundamentally to carry on the earnest cleaning up to the class struggle magnification mistake. The democracy within the party, the mass line and the National People's Congress system and so on the democratic political construction question, has not obtained the entire party to take highly. Our country's political system spring the nearly 10 years development course basically from 1957 to 1966 is evolves along the unceasing concentration of power direction. After ""the Great Leap Forward movement"" and “against the Right”, the country political system authority centralization further develops, the entire political system formed one kind of altitude concentration of power pattern in the structure and the function, the authority more and more much has concentrated in party's system, the party politics does not divide. Once unifies with the class struggle magnification mistake, then can accelerate to cause the turmoil to have the factor accumulation, finally breeds the turmoil. Fourth chapter, in Contemporary China political system construction advancement serious setback (in May, 1966 - October, 1976). Our country's political system process ""previous ten years"" the winding development, presents the high degree of concentration in the structure the aspect. In the system disease allied groups interweaves, the union in class struggle question fault, finally has caused ""the Great Cultural Revolution"" occurrence. The anarchism and the authority high degree of concentration accompanies but the line, people's democratic right suffers tramples, the social economy appears stagnates even backs up. ""The Great Cultural Revolution"" center, our country's political system has experienced the serious setback and the malformed development process. At ""the Great Cultural Revolution"" center, the new political power organization form - revolutionary committee, in was considered at that time was has the world significance the new pioneering work. In fact, its production is our country political system in the function; structure significantly transforms and backs up. The revolutionary committee has obliterated the government and enterprise's difference, cancelled in the modern country to have the basic division of labor, it front the party politics did not divide ""the Great Cultural Revolution"", the without a clear line between the functions of the government and enterprises unified leadership system, developed party politics, the government and business gathers a chaos body. It only adapts the serious class struggle magnification, but unsuitably manages the modern society the request. Generally speaking, these ten year center political system has developed in the former political system malpractice, like the authority high degree of concentration, the party politics do not divide, individual despotism, lacks the democracy, the inspector general and so on, this is ""the Great Cultural Revolution"" can continue for ten years long time the important reason. In system serious disease created the serious efficiency to be low, the bureaucratism, the unhealthy tendency, the feudal privileges and so on. This kind of system both cannot contain the class struggle magnification the development, and lacks effectively solves each kind of social contradictory intrinsic mechanism and the ability, but only can allow each kind of contradictory development, the accumulation, is lying concealed the various social crisis. ""Great Cultural Revolution"" the occurrence and its creates the long-term turmoil, deepened and has developed the entire party and the whole nation to the political system in the serious disease understanding, might say, proposed the political reform duty, first was our party profound reconsidering ""the Great Cultural Revolution"" the lesson, from realized the national politics life normalization and the long-term peace and good government angle embarks, realized to the political system to the social development and the stable important result, did not have ""the Great Cultural Revolution"", also did not have the afterwards political reform. Fifth chapter, Contemporary China political reform duty proposing with implementation (in October 1976 - September 1997). Since 11 session of Third Session has convened, realizes our party founding of the nation to have the profound historical significance the great transition. This conference corrected ""take the class struggle as the outline"" the erroneous line, has realized party's work key shift, has provided the political premise for our country political reform; At the same time proposed a series of routes general and specific policies, in particular about the development socialism democracy and the perfect socialist legal system goal, about changes the productive relations and the overtop structure duty which the same productive forces development does not adapt, has laid the rationale for our country political reform. After 1980, our party started the political reform exploration and the practice, is overcoming the authority high degree of concentration, straightens out the party politics relations, strengthens the state power institution, the administrative organ and judicial organ's work, the transformation government function, simplified administration, decentralizes power, reforms aspect and so on cadre system has obtained the preliminary result. But, this section of time reform, regardless of practices from the theory looked like does not have the concrete application, the systematization, not yet obtains the substantive breakthrough in many important questions, some reforms achievement has not been able to consolidate, even has drawn back, the political reform not yet has a whole to conceive with the overall plan. In September 1982, the Communist Party of China convened 12th the National People's Congress. The congress explicitly pointed out that, the political reform duty constructs the high socialism democracy diligently. The socialism people mainly expand to the political life, the economic life, the cultural life and social life each aspect, autonomously develops each business and enterprise unit's democratic management, the development basic unit social life populace. Party's 12 big first has used ""the political reform"" officially the terminology, symbolized our country political reform is bringing order out of chaos, the summary history experience and the reform and open policy start generalissimo type mentions the agenda. The party 13 has formulated the political reform grand blueprint greatly, and in party's document comprehensively systematically elaborated political reform, this is unprecedented. This blueprint overall speaking, is must base our country national condition, fully considered our country the social history condition and the reality bearing capacity, the proper attention to both long term goal and the short-term goal two aspects, under party leader's, will have the plan to have the step, stably safely will advance the political reform. The right political reform has the leadership, has the step, orderly carries on, in 1989 spring China occurs the political disturbance and on international occurs east Soviet the drastic change, this to the entire China's reform advancement, was specially the political reform has had the significant influence and the disturbance. Facing such significant event, how comes up from the positive significance the summary experience lesson, takes the corresponding countermeasure to persist the reform and open policy does not vacillate, this test on our party is enormous. In order to stand firm the general situation, causes Chinese the political reform advancement does not receive ""is left"" and the right ideological trend disturbance, the political reform suitably slowed down the footsteps. At the beginning of 1992 Deng Xiaoping's south conversed, causes a people's thought liberation, further deepened the economic restructuring regarding our party, closely held economic development this center not to vacillate, played the significant role. In October, 1992, the party 14 acted according to south Deng Xiaoping to converse greatly the spirit, the establishment and the consummation socialist market economy system took our country economic restructuring the goal, at the same time proposed wanted ""positively to advance the political reform"". Explicitly pointed out that, ""the political reform goal, is take consummates the multi- parties cooperation and the political consultation system which the National People's Congress system, the communist party leads as the main content, development socialism democratic politics."" This time political reform objective point lies in the advancement government apparatus to simplify, the transform/shift the government functions as well as to strengthen the legislative work, the advancement democracy at the grassroots level construction. China's political reform has not stopped in fact, but is had by the new generation of leader the step slowly to advance. After the party 14 is big, the legislation work strengthens greatly. In 14 big later several years, will formulate 113 laws, will be forming take the constitution as the core socialism legal framework, the socialist market economy legal framework will begin to take shape, this for the party 15 loudly proposed the construction socialism country under the rule of law essential plan, has provided the basis. Sixth chapter, Contemporary China political reform deepening and forecast (in September, 1997 - present). Our country economic restructuring is thorough and the socialism modernization cross-century development, requests us in to persist the Four Fundamental Principles under the premise, continues to advance the political reform, further expands the socialism democracy, the perfect socialist legal system, rules a nation legally, construction socialism country under the rule of law. The party 15 is big, 16 greatly from the cross-century development strategic altitude, to continued to carry out the political reform to make the comprehensive deployment. Most essential is in some significant formulations and the mentality has the significant breakthrough in the political reform, rules a nation the plan to propose legally, to party's ruling rule exploration, as well as development socialism democratic politics has manifested the new time our party regarding Deng Xiaoping political reform theory inheriting, and has made the recent development in the new practice foundation. This is our country democratic politics construction important milestone. Further deepens the political reform the basic conception is defers to the political movement institution, standardized and the sequenced request, reasonably limits the party and the state power institution, the administrative organ, the judicial organ and public organization's relations, forms modernized gradually the Chinese characteristic socialism democratic political system. How knew and has appraised our country 20 for many years political reforms. Some people thought China ""the political reform progress is slow, even does not pace back and forth front"". In fact, our party and the country are adapting the economic restructuring and the economy need to develop, according to democratized and rule of law in close integration with request, according to China's actual situation, in positively safely advances the political reform continuously. (1) 11 session of Third Session symbolized the China political reform and at the same time the economic restructuring carries on start. (2) ""Party And National Leadership System Reform"" the birth indicated that, China's political reform and the economic restructuring are at the same time carries on. (3) The reform concrete practice measure proved that, China's political reform and the economic restructuring is at the same time carries on. (4) Since party's 13 big reports about the political reform achievement will have been 11 session of Third Session's reform experience summary and take this as the foundation future reform tentative plan. In this foundation, 15 are big, 16 to continue to carry out the political reform and in some significant formulations and the mentality has the significant breakthrough in the political reform greatly. (5) China's political reform and the economic restructuring is seeps mutually inalienably. (6) Political reform is very hard, the long-term characteristic and the complexity, cause the effect which it has not been able like economic restructuring such to get quick results, makes the people to be easy to neglect it the fact which carries on with the economic restructuring at the same time. 20 for many years, our country's political reform and the democratic political construction accumulated the rich experience lesson for us, and give us by the historical enlightenment. First, must make the correct limits to the political reform nature, confirmed the political reform was carries on the consummation to the original system, but was not to the basic political system total repudiation. Second, the political reform and the democratic political construction must persist the Four Fundamental Principles. In the reform advancement, we must strictly distinguish clearly our country political system malpractice and the fundamental political system superiority are at, emancipate the mind, realistic, namely persists with the consummation basic politics system, also eradicates the old system thoroughly the malpractice. Only then the Four Fundamental Principles can our all development pattern, the way and the motion command. Third, the political reform and the democratic political construction must process the good political reform, the political development and the political stable relations. The political reform is wants for the political development, but must carry on under the maintenance politics stable condition. Fourth, the China political reform must be advances gradually the type to carry on, but cannot be impatient for success. After more than 20 years political reform is basic is follows anxiously slow, starts with the easy and then does the difficult first, the periphery the core, gradually arrives such way gradually to launch gradually, thoroughly to carry on unceasingly first. Fifth, the political reform and the democratic political construction must experience a quite long historical process, must have the step, and orderly carry on. Sixth, grasps firmly the reform the overall, the overall importance and the overall goal uniformity. The economic restructuring and the political reform all is in the overall reform part, all must take thus cannot be separated from the entire reform the overall situation, therefore, these two kind of reforms must be consistent. A country implements any type the political system, must adapts with this national condition and the nature. China's socialism democratic politics, the reason that is most suits the Chinese national condition democratic politics, is most can the democratic politics which condenses the Chinese 1.3 billion people's wills and the strength struggles together, the key lie in it to take root comes in Chinese nation several millenniums to live and the development broad fertile soil, produces for strives for the national independence and the country in the Communist Party of China and the Chinese people is prosperous and powerful the great practice which but carries on. The reality development is the historical development continuation. We develop the socialism democratic politics, must base on the Chinese reality, persisted the Chinese communist leadership, persisted the people are master of own affairs, persist the socialist system the characteristic and the superiority. All civilized achievements creates which to the human society including political civilization beneficial achievement, we must positively profit from, but does not imitate other country political system the pattern.",1026923214, 当代中国政治体制的形成、演变与改革,Dissertations & Theses," Zhong, Zhen ZhenZhongZhenZhenZhong, Zhen Zhen钟真真",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715038171 , 70534442 , 189128 , H388200 , H388200", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 当代中国政治体制的形成、演变与改革,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026923214?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAIH388200 , Social sciences , Contemporary China political system , development process , form , reform , 形成 , 改革 , 政治体制 , 演变",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+forming%2C+development+and+reform+of+China%27s+contemporary+political+system&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhong%2C+Zhen+Zhen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Model of Urbanization with the Multiple Dual-economy Structure,"On the basis of the traditional theory of dual-economy and positive study of the urbanization model of Japan, this paper developed a general model of urbanization by which we employed to the case of China. The contents run as follows. 1.The theoretical definition of urbanization The urbanization, synchronized with the change of economic and population structure is by definition a process of factor movement on the one hand between industries with the upgrading of industries structure, and on the other between the counties to the cities and between cities. So, the industrialization is the abstract economic connotation of urbanization, while the movement of industries and population is the concrete phenomena of urbanization. The development of urbanization of an area is influenced by many factors. Firstly, the stock and structure of resource is the initial conditions of urbanization. Secondly, the inner evolution situation is the underlined mechanisms of urbanization. Thirdly, the supply of institutions by government is the institutional condition of urbanization. Fourthly, the international environment and the level of the division o labor constitute the exterior condition of urbanization. 2.The Characteristic of and development of cities and the urbanization of Japan Like the developing countries, the urbanization of Japan also get incentive from industrialization, was linked with the sub-dual economy of cities economy and the highly agglomeration of the prior cities. But Japan realized urbanization and industrialization simultaneously as well as full-employment. The reason is analyzed. Firstly, the Japan government provided effectively institutions in the process of industrialization. The development of private capital played the role as the foundation of industrialization. Secondly, there was an integral system of division of labor within the cities economy besides the dual-economy; namely, the modern and traditional sectors were in good connection, promoting the urbanization simultaneously. Thirdly, the highly agglomeration of firms and population towards Tokyo was not the result of government influence but a requirement of economy development. At the same time, there was an organic relationship in the city system by which the diffusion effect of big cities can result a larger scope of urbanization. Fourthly, the government paid attention to the protection of the traditional department in the process of industrialization, resulting a harmonious development between industries and preventing in advance excess expansion. Fifthly, the most important role of government played in the process of urbanization was to promote the movement of labor force and their inhabitation in the cities, thus the profit from urbanization was share by the national people. Sixthly, the development of urbanization was characterized with intensivism, making the development sustainable. Japan was the only one of counties with middle level of income which became an advanced industrialized country, therefore its success experience can use for reference by the developing countries including China. 3. The development of the traditional theory of dual-economy and the design of urbanization model. The urbanization cannot be refused by the problem of its excess development, which should lead us to rethink the defect of the model of dual-economy. As to the Todaro model, we argued that, its goal is not to resolve the problems of modernization but the gap of income between rural and urban areas. Todaro denied the function of industrialization for urban employment just for the failure in the strategies of industrialization of developing countries, ignoring the important effect of manufacture industry to drive the development of other industries and of the third industry to add to employment. In Todaro’ mind, the center of development was agriculture and rural economy, but he didn’t realize the abundant of rural unemployment and the limitation of agriculture in absorb labor. The developing countries would stay at a low level of development state if Todaro’s policy was employed. So it was necessary to construct a more instructive model of urbanization by referring to Japan’s success experience and keeping in mind the goals and situation of the developing countries. Our urbanization model runs as follows. ⑴ the key hypothesis Firstly, we suppose the existence of multiple dual-economy structure, with the traditional and modern department as the basic structure and other dual-structure in every department as the second level. Therefore, the economy development depends on the one hand on the scale and level of modern department development, on the other hand on the relation between modern and traditional department and among every department. The process of economy development is characterized by mutual action between modern and traditional department. Secondly, the government played an important role in allocation of resource for the reason of market failure, for the need of great - leap - forward development as well as for the motivation of obtaining monopoly rent by government. The key problem of development lies in making up for the loss of market failure and preventing government failure. Thirdly, we supposed that the supply of labor in cities and counties is abundant, that is, there is surplus labor in counties and the cities are not fully employed. Fourthly, under the situation of open economy, the development of urbanization is influenced by movement of external factors. Fifthly, the scale of the prior cities and the formation of city system are the result of some kind of agglomeration, with the movement of labor force between cities as the phenomena. ⑵The contents of the model Firstly, the development of traditional department is the foundation industrialization and urbanization, not only because the former supply the latter with agricultural surplus (products, capital, and labor force) but also because the increase of income of rural areas brings forth a larger market for non-agricultural products and a higher quality of labor force. Secondly, the priority given to manufacture industry causes the change of employment structure, with multiplication effect as the key of employment increase. The expansion of manufacture industry not only improves the level of urbanization but also by conjunction effect pushing the development of other industries especially the third industry. So, the increase of urban employment often goes to the third industry. Thirdly, the movement of labor force from the traditional department to the modern department depends not only on the increase of demand of labor caused by expansion of the modern department but also on the quality of labor force. Fouthly, without the mandatory constrain of movement of labor force by administration, the ultimate reason of labor movement is the gap of welfare level between rural and urban areas, but not the expected income of working in cities argued buy Todaro. The movement of labor force was caused not only by the comparison of agricultural and non-agricultural revenue, but also by comparison of rural and urban welfare. So there are three kinds of possibilities. The first, there would have no movement of labor, if the income from non-agricultural employment is not greater than that from agriculture and welfare of cities is not greater than that of counties. In that case, the phenomena of anti-urbanization, that is, the backflow of labor, would appear. The second, there will be only part-time employment and the identity of peasants will not be changed as non-citizens, if the income from non-agricultural employment is not greater than that from agriculture yet the welfare of cities is not greater than that of counties. The third, if not only the income from non-agricultural employment is greater than that from agriculture but also the welfare of cities is greater than that of counties, the population movement will occur and the level of urbanization will be improved. Fifthly, the system of division of labor in sub-dual-structure in non-agricultural department has positive effect on the development of urbanization. Sixthly, the scale of cities as well as the city system was determined by the scale and structure of departments. The change of industry structure will cause the change of the scale and function of the cities. The doubling effect and diffusing effect of cities development are also decided by the structure and level of industry. ⑶Policy suggestions Firstly, the harmonious development policy of industries. Conduct a harmonious development of both traditional and modern departments in the process of industrialization. Trade off the pushing force from the development of agriculture and the pulling force from industrialization, so as to realize the full employment of the inflow labor force in cities. Secondly, the employment policy of city labor force. Responding to the demand of high quality of labor of the modern department, the government should pay important attention to the improvement of the skill level of the labor force, increasing on the one hand the education investment in counties and on the other hand the skill train for labor force in cities. Thirdly, the policy to inhabit the labor force. The government should sustain on the one hand the social costs of population movement and increase the public investment to reinforce the infrastructure of production and living, on the other hand, on the other hand the individual costs by providing cheap housing, skill train, and employment information. Fourthly, the policy to develop the informal department. Given the limited development of the formal department, the development of the informal department can increase the employment and push the development of urbanization. The support from the government can be tax cut or reduction and information providing. Fourthly, the model of Chinese urbanization. The model of Chinese urbanization includes many aspects such as the status quo of urbanization, the international environments, the economy and social goals, the system of Industry support, the space structure, and the policy support system. ⑴The determination of the level of Chinese urbanization. We argue that the level of the Chinese urbanization is the same as the level of Industrialization. Firstly, this relationship is not directly appeared in statistics, and the gap of between these two levels can not deliver the right information. Secondly, although by international comparison the level if Chinese urbanization is lower than the world average for more than 10 percent, but by consideration of the income level of China, we can draw the conclusion above mention. ⑵The constrain of the Chinese urbanization. The strict constrains are resource, environments, the dual- structure with its rigidity, the trading off between the foodstuff safety and full employment and high level of industrialization, the trading off between the level of urbanization and economy efficiency, and the trading off between the opportunity of obtain international resource and the challenge from international competition. The factors of industrialization: the weakening and “Latin Americalized” of industrialization; the weakening of the relationship between industrialization and urbanization. The constrains of institutions: firstly, the process of urbanization is influenced by non-economy factors; secondly, (by the negative external effect of the public policy,) the transformation of strict exclusion to soft exclusion of peasants by institution, and the softening of the exclusion by the central government and the strengthening of exclusion by the local governments. Thirdly, the compulsory exploitation of peasants still exists. The peasants who lost lands become a new weak class. Fourthly, the local protectionism is still in existing. The evident characteristic of the society of China is that the economy order and the movement of population are determined by the strict grade structure, which exists between individuals, line of business, regions and between cities. It is because of this kind of institutional constrains that the dual-structure of China has not been transformed to the unified structure, but reinforced and institutionized. ⑶ The goals of urbanization The ultimate goal of accelerating the development of urbanization is to promote a sustainable, stable, and harmonious development of the economy society. The present goal is to transfer the surplus labor force and maintain the high speed development of economy. The long-term goal is two-fold; firstly, deconstruct the dual-structure to a unified one, and realize the dream of comparatively well-off society. Secondly, change the traditional model of development by urbanization, realizing a sustainable development. Four fundamental perspectives should be changed when constructing the model of Chinese urbanization. Firstly, change from purely promoting city development to harmonious development of rural and urban areas. Secondly, change from realizing full employment of flowing population to habiting them in cities. Thirdly, change from encouraging individual abilities of the citizens to protecting the interest of weak class in the cities. Fourthly, change from focusing on economy growth to welfare improvement. ⑷The design of the Chinese model of urbanization Construct the industry support system of the Chinese urbanization based on the new industrialization, which causes the expansion of industry which in turn increases the demand of labor and accelerate the movement of population from counties to cities. At the same time , the new industrialization will change the traditional industry structure and improve the development of urbanization. Construct the space support system of many entities with the big cities as the center. Because firstly, there are some laws of the development of the big cities, secondly, the big cities have special advantages for the development of economy and the acceleration of the urbanization, for example, it is applicable for the development of intensivism-economy, for the demand of full employment, and it has greater power in some areas where small cities have no power. Because of the uneven level of development between the regions of China, we should employ different models in different stages. In the developed areas of coastal and inner lands, we should employ the model of metropolitan, but in the undeveloped areas, we should develop big cities with priority. Construct the policy support system of the Chinese urbanization in order to bring forth a harmonious society. The development of urbanization should be based on the market and lead by the government. The main policy runs as follows. Promote the free movement of labor force and population by reforming the household register system and strengthening the infrastructures between the regions. Encourage the liberal employment in the cities by unifying the labor market of counties and cities, supporting the informal department and middle and small firms, and providing more train of skill and information of employment. Encourage inhabiting the cities by equal social welfare policy and protection of weak class and perfection of infrastructures in cities. Promote the integral development of cities, by enacting sustainable policy and weakening the local protectionism to bring forth a common market.",1026923744, 多重二元经济结构下的城市化模式研究,Dissertations & Theses," Zhao, Rui GuangZhaoGuangRuiZhao, Rui Guang赵光瑞",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715042821 , 70534652 , 189128 , H374377 , H374377", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 多重二元经济结构下的城市化模式研究,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026923744?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAIH374377 , Social sciences , the dual-economy , the model of urbanization , the strategies of the Chinese urbanization , the urbanization of Japan , 中国城市化战略 , 城市化模式 , 多重二元结构 , 日本城市化模式",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Model+of+Urbanization+with+the+Multiple+Dual-economy+Structure&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhao%2C+Rui+Guang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Development of World Trade in Services ,Current Situation of China and Measures to be Undertaken","This paper has discussed the growth in services trade, and reviewed some of the potential benefits and risks from liberalizing it further. Many countries have liberalized international services trade unilaterally, or in bilateral, regional, and multilateral trade agreements. The role of services has changed dramatically in recent decades. Services represent the largest single sector in developed economies and increasingly in developing economies as well, accounting for nearly two-thirds of value-added and employment in the former and about half in the latter. Services are also the fastest-growing component of international trade. Since 1980, services exports have grown more strongly than merchandise exports and now amount to about US$1.5 trillion annually, or about one-fifth of total world exports. Trade in services is defined to cover four modes of supply: 1.	 Cross-border supply (mode 1): the service consumer is in his country of residence, while the service supplier is outside the country of the consumer; examples are transportation services or internet-based trade. 2.	 Consumption abroad (mode 2): the service consumer moves outside his home territory and consumes services in another country; examples are tourism or education overseas. 3.	 Commercial presence (mode 3): the service supplier establishes, through foreign direct investment, an enterprise in the territory of the consumer and supplies the service to the consumer; examples are services rendered by foreign-owned banks. 4.	 Temporary movement of natural persons (mode 4): an individual who is either selfemployed or working on behalf of his employer moves to the territory of the consumer to provide the service; examples include services provided by an on-site engineer. The GATS distinguishes among four modes of supply in service trade: 1 Cross-border supply (e.g. transport, financial services, consulting, etc.), 2 Consumption abroad (e.g. tourism), 3 Commercial presence (e.g. the activity of foreign affiliates) 4 Movement of individuals (e.g. temporary movement of workers), Most services traded, whether exported or imported, relate to tourism (around 30 per cent) and transport (around 25 per cent), followed by the business services (12 per cent) and financial services (6 percent). The composition of services trade is similar at the individual country level In international trade textbooks, lower services trade intensities are often related to the cost of transport, which is, for some services, much higher than the cost of shipping manufactured goods.8 Also, the influence of geographical and structural factors, such as location and size of the economy, on trade in services and manufactured goods may differ. Cross-country patterns of export intensities and import penetration ratios suggest that these factors play partly the same role as for trade in goods. The services trade has grown rapidly in the 1990s but less than the goods trade. The magnitude of the services trade is underestimated by conventional measures. In fact, one dollar of exported services creates more employment and generates more revenue than one dollar from the export of goods. This is primarily due to the phenomenon of the international fragmentation of goods production, which is more developed than that for services. either transport or travel had the highest real export for most countries in 1986. Since then, on average all sectors experienced real export growth. In some countries, like the USA, financial services, royalties and other business services are also relatively big contributors to exports. In particular ‘other’ business services, which includes, amongst others, professional services and research, is an important sector in real exports. Cross-border trade in services is growing rapidly, with both developed and developing countries among the most dynamic exporters. Cross-border trade in business services, especially the so-called “IT-enabled services”, is today among the fastest growing areas of international trade. While the industrial countries are the largest exporters of such services, some of the most dynamic exporters are developing countries. Three factors are responsible for this phenomenon. First, advances in technology have made cross-border trade possible in a number of services that were previously only tradable through the movement of providers. Second, substantial investments in education in a number of developing countries have created a relative abundance of skilled labor, and the absence of commensurate employment opportunities has ensured its availability at a relatively low wage. Finally, innovations in business practice have led to the out-location of service activities by multinational enterprises in the manufacturing and services industry to offshore operational units or their outsourcing to foreign third-party service suppliers. However, our limited knowledge in that area has another explanation. Services, apart from tourism, were used to be considered non-tradable in many trade textbooks and few theories have been developed so far to explain the specific features that services could have over goods. Progress in communications technology has facilitated the provision of services based on telecommunications networks and the outsourcing of producer services, including to foreign providers. The recent growth of services in developed countries, for example, has been fuelled in part by “new economy services” such as e-commerce, software production, and other services. Efficiency in the production of services has an important bearing on economic performance and development. Services like transportation and distribution, education and health, and banking and finance are of critical importance in developing countries, both for the emergence of a competitive manufacturing sector and, more broadly, for social development and poverty reduction. In many poor countries, economic and social development is hampered by the lack of adequate basic infrastructure such as roads, power supply, telecommunications, and public transport (World Bank, 2002). Openness to services trade may therefore entail major benefits by helping the poorest countries to obtain infrastructure services at internationally competitive prices. The liberalization of transportation and financial services, for example, is expected to significantly lower costs in merchandise trade.Where countries have opened up to international services transactions, they have enhanced the efficiency of existing domestic services industries by attracting fresh capital and providing incentives for restructuring inefficient companies. Trade in services has important implications for the balance of payments. Many developing countries have benefited from exports of construction, banking, and professional services or from services transactions based on telecommunications networks (such as data processing and entry, and software production). Remittances from nationals residing abroad and the compensation of residents temporarily employed abroad represent important currency revenues, in some countries rivaling export receipts. Furthermore, international services trade has important implications for capital flows. Recent estimates suggest that nearly 60 percent of international services transactions are conducted through foreign affiliates of multinational companies. Already, nearly one-half of the total outward FDI stock of OECD economies is in services sectors. The first impression of trade in services confirms the idea set out in Chapter 1 that services are gaining importance in international trade as they have already done in the structure of production. Chapter 1 revealed several possible causes for growth in trade: technological advances that increase tradeability, international liberalisation that allows foreign competition and specialisation, and increased demand for and production of services because of rising incomes and increasing service intensity of intermediate demand. Section 2.4 will consider whether growth in volume has coincided with increased openness of service sectors. This could be an indication for improvements in tradeability of services. As such then, growth in trade is not only demand driven, but also follows developments at the supply-side (technology and perhaps deregulation). As of yet, we cannot evaluate the relative size of trade in services, in comparison to merchandise. Since 1994, the GATS has established a multilateral regulatory framework for international services trade, and in the ongoing WTO round this agreement will be refined further. While the GATS provides opportunities for countries to credibly lock in their policy regimes and reap the benefits of more open services markets in the multilateral context, it also raises issues of coherence between the policies promoted by international institutions, including the IMF, the WTO, and the World Bank. The key tenets of the GATS—transparency of regulatory regimes, and nondiscriminatory treatment of foreign service suppliers—provide powerful incentives that will help to attract the capital, expertise, and access to international information networks that global service companies control. Yet, opening to foreign service competition needs to be sequenced carefully with macroeconomic stabilization, capital account reforms, and the upgrading of domestic regulations, such as corporate governance or financial supervision, giving the IMF an important role, through continued policy advice, in ensuring that all its members benefit from the globalization of services This paper documents and assesses the significance of the policy changes in China that WTO accession implies in key service categories (banking, insurance, telecoms etc.), asking whether it is likely they will really be fully implemented in their entirety as undertaken at signature in 2002.While it would seem that China will have extraordinarily open markets for these services by 2007 (and for banking, perhaps in the world) In services, China’s markets will open for distribution, telecommunications, financial services, professional, business and computer services, motion pictures, environmental services, accounting, law, architecture, construction, travel and tourism, and other industries. Here we take advantage of some of the trading system’s newest features, in the WTO’s Agreements on Financial Services and Basic elecommunications. The Financial Services Agreement, covering nearly $60 trillion in banking, insurance and securities transactions each year, is history’s largest single trade agreement ever. Though it went into force just a short time ago -- the little fellow’s first birthday was just last Wednesday -- it has already helped American banks, securities firms and insurance companies expand operations and find new market opportunities, through ownership of and investment in foreign banking institutions, brokerage and insurance sectors, as well as through cross-border trade. Its direct value is already becoming evident in statistics: in 1998, Americans exported $13.7 billion worth of financial services; and while we do not have final figures for 1999, as the Financial Services Agreement went into effect, this may have grown fully 10%, to about $15 billion. The Agreement on Basic Telecommunications is equally significant. Opening world markets in a sector dominated for 60 years by monopolies and promoting pro-competitive regulatory principles, in just two years, it has eroded the ability of dominant carriers in foreign countries to keep rates artificially high and depress demand for telecommunications services and electronic commerce. It has already, for example, helped bring down rates to levels as low as 10 to 20 cents per minute, for calls between the U.S. and countries such as Japan and Mexico. These are commitments China will accept as well. In some services fields -- for example, audiovisual -- China joins only a very few countries in making market access commitments. In some of them, including through participation in the Basic Telecom and Financial Services Agreements it will open markets now almost entirely closed -- as witness the rather pathetic total of $49 million in financial service exports to China in 1998. the commitments that China has taken on in the services area as part of their WTO accession process are simultaneously extraordinarily deep and wide ranging. Breathtaking has been an adjective frequently used to describe them. Over a 5 year period from 2002 to 2007 China will seemingly fully open all of its markets to full international competition from foreign service providers in a series of key areas; distribution, telecommunications, financial services, professional business and computer services, motion pictures, environmental services, accounting, law, architecture, construction, and travel and tourism. All barriers to entryin the form of discriminatory licenses to operate will be removed and all conduct barriers in the form of differential regulation for domestic and foreign entries will be removed. And internationally, the WTO accession will deepen and speed a process of integration that has helped China become a more integrated, responsible member of the Pacific community. Over thirty years, as China has reformed its economy and opened to the world, its stake in the region’s stability and prosperity has grown. At the same time, China’s economic reforms have helped to move its government away from the revolutionary foreign policy of the 1950s and 1960s, and towards a positive and constructive role in maintaining peace on the Korean Peninsula, in the Asian financial crisis, and as a member of the UN Security Council.",1026923773, 世界服务贸易的发展及我国的现状与对策,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, QiongZhangQiongZhang, Qiong张琼",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715042101 , 70534652 , 189128 , H390092 , H390092", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese, 世界服务贸易的发展及我国的现状与对策,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026923773?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAIH390092 , Social sciences , International trade in services , comparision between countries , 国际比较 , 服务贸易",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Development+of+World+Trade+in+Services+%2CCurrent+Situation+of+China+and+Measures+to+be+Undertaken&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Qiong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Transforming British organics: the role of central government, 1980 - 2006","With clear evidence of major increases in the global market for organic food, the organic 'growth narrative' has evolved as both the central facet of contemporary academic examination of organic agriculture and as the dominant discourse for the organic movement itself. However, this narrative masks a dynamic complexity as changes in the organic sector have not just been of scale but are complicit in changes to the qualitative characteristics of 'organics'. The new economic, social and political contexts in which organics are now being constructed means that it is an increasingly contested term. In this context, the thesis is primarily concerned with the transformation of British organics towards being a successful market commodity and an agricultural policy instrument. With a particular focus on the political sphere, the thesis examines the evolving engagement of the British government with the UK organic movement since 1980 and the materialisation of particular policy outcomes for organic agriculture. Given the organic movement's critique of 'conventional' farming, support from government has been mixed, although the study records a progressive shift in favour of organics. It is essential to establish why organic agriculture has become a policy issue for government and, crucially, how government has dealt with the criticism of mainstream agriculture that organics contains. The thesis identifies several 'organic agricultural policy networks' to conceptualise the changing relations between the government and other interests. The study draws on the insights of an interpretative tradition which contends that policy networks are enacted by individuals. Together, these actors have constructed three different organic 'storylines' that are constituted in the particular memberships of the policy network in temporally specific sets of circumstances. An important focus, therefore, is the way in which the actors in the network have 'acted on organics' in the making of organic policy.",1428929004,,Dissertations & Theses," Tomlinson, Isobel JaneTomlinsonJaneIsobelTomlinson, Isobel Jane",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3059340411 , 81401972 , 189128 , 9781303383298 , U593221 , U593221", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781303383298, English, English,,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1428929004?accountid=14496, 0359 Food Science, 0359 Food Science, 0359 Food Science,, 0359 Food Science, Food Science," (UMI)AAIU593221 , Biological sciences , Britain , Growth narrative , Organic food , Organic movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transforming+British+organics%3A+the+role+of+central+government%2C+1980+-+2006&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tomlinson%2C+Isobel+Jane&amp;isbn=9781303383298&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"La fabrique de la stratégie du commerce équitable,"Fair trade (FT) is an organized social movement of international trade which promotes the payment of a fair price as well as upholding social and environmental standards through the export of goods and services from developing countries to developed countries, including handicrafts, coffee, cocoa, tea, bananas, honey, cotton, wine, fresh fruit, and so on. Fair trade organizations (FTOs) from developed countries are generally engaged in bringing these products on the market, as well as in supporting producers, raising awareness, and in campaigning for changes in the rules and practice of conventional international trade. FTOs, by their hybrid nature, face complex issues that call into question the notion of strategy, whatever the level of analysis (macroscopic, mesoscopic or microscopic). In order to deal with these two aspects (hybridity and complexity), we adopt a microscopic approach known as strategy-as-practice. In this approach, the practices, routines, individual acts, conversations and other everyday activities (implied or explicit) deployed by practitioners inside as well as outside organizations, comprise basic elements in the strategic process. Our main question is, ""How is fair-trade strategy constructed?"". Our aim is to understand some practices that contribute to the making and rollout of FTO strategies. To do this, we use a grounded theory research approach. The main source of data is participant observation, spread out over a period of nine months, in the Canadian FT sector as well as more specifically in and around a Canadian FTO. This manuscript-based thesis comprises three articles that look at three facets of strategy as practice in FTOs strategy-making. In the first article ("" Unpacking 'sharedness' in institutional theory: insights from the Canadian Fair Trade sector ""), we look at how the discursive content that circulates among practitioners participating in field-configuring events in the Canadian FT sector is disseminated and organized. In fact, 'sharedness' (e.g., shared norms, shared understandings, shared values, shared agreement, shared discourse, shared knowledge, shared patterns of action) is a key concept in institutional literature with little or no definition. We unpack the notion by analyzing the discursive content (issues, topics and themes) that circulates among practitioners. The results suggest, first, that there are several ways of sharing discursive content, and second, that these different forms of sharing are manipulated by practitioners to serve their own interests. In the second article. ("" Gazing the prose of everyday strategizing: the dialogue between 'chronotopes' in discursive practices/practicing ""), we look at the nature of the discursive content mobilized by practitioners from an FTO to deal with, and convince, their interlocutors. We propose the concept of ""chronotope"" (a distinct fusion of reference to space and time in utterance) to assess the discursive activities deployed by practitioners in their everyday interactions with their stakeholders (current and potential customers, suppliers, investors, etc.). The results suggest, first, that there are several kinds of discursive repertoires based on distinct chronotopic motifs, and second, that practitioners are bricoleurs , crafting discursive practices in their everyday interactions. In the third article ("" Dialectical tensions and practical coping strategies: towards a dialogical perspective ""), we look at how practitioners in a FTO react to the presence of dialectical tensions (e.g., integration/separation, revealment/concealment, stability/change) in the FT sector and FT practices as such. The results suggest, first, that practitioners adopt—deliberately and automatically—a number of practical coping strategies, and second, that these practical coping strategies have repercussions at the organizational level. After integrating the results of the three aspects of our research, we develop, in the conclusion, an outline for a theoretical framework we call strategy-as-dialogue based on the work of Russian literary scholar Mikhail Mikhailovitch Bakhtin. In this theoretical framework, we propose a dialogical approach to the making of strategy in context.

Exploring the banality of national discourse through a study of everyday talk and media texts in England,"This study explores the banality of national discourse in England in an era that has been described as globalising. Drawing on the broader tenets of social constructionism, the concept of sedimentation will be employed as a means of understanding how certain discourses come to be embedded in the everyday lives of significant numbers in relation to particular historical conditions. This framework will be used to extend Michael Billig's seminal thesis of Banal Nationalism (1995) in an effort to address the complexities of a multi-national, post-imperial society. The primary data set comes from a series of interviews with white, English-born people, who constitute the majority group in Britain. Various media texts have also been studied as a means of tracking any relevant debates at another level of society. The analysis suggests that national discourse continues to offer a 'common sense' heuristic within social interactions, informing manifold ways in which people articulate their lives. The resonance of this discourse is exhibited through a whole range of micro-linguistic and inter-textual features, underpinned by a framework of shared knowledge and assumptions. This framework was particularly evident when people discussed issues such as immigration and multiculturalism, which were generally evaluated as threats to a homogeneous and bounded national space. In these cases, distinctions were made between those who un/conditionally belonged to the nation, with various minority groups often stigmatised as internal 'Others' and seen to be destabilising everyday (national) practices, utterances and symbols. The growing sense of ontological insecurity generated by these perceived threats is also thought to partly underlie the increasing visibility of national displays within England at the current time. Finally, while increasing global mobility may sometimes pose a challenge to national frameworks, I suggest that any movement beyond the nation, whether cognitive and/or physical, is better conceptualised as a form of conditional cosmopolitanism, often underpinned by a secure sense of 'home', agency and access to cultural / economic capital.",1626152639,,Dissertations & Theses," Skey, MichaelSkeyMichaelSkey, Michael",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3501806901 , 91885082 , 189128 , 9781321355222 , U615933 , U615933", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781321355222, English, English,,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1626152639?accountid=14496, 0459 Communication, 0459 Communication, 0459 Communication,, 0459 Communication, Communication," (UMI)AAIU615933 , Communication and the arts , National discourse",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Flagging+nations%3F+Exploring+the+banality+of+national+discourse+through+a+study+of+everyday+talk+and+media+texts+in+England&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Skey%2C+Michael&amp;isbn=9781321355222&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A study on appropriate scale of government management distorted accounting information,"Translation from original language as provided by author Accounting information distortion is a universal phenomenon in the international and domestic market from the past to the present, so how to solve the problem becomes a focus in the theory study. All governments have launched deep and lasting movements for solution, but the movements have had no obvious results, the Enron scandal in the US is an outstanding example. In China governing accounting information has three stages in the following: from foundation of PRC to holding the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC the government emphasized on building accounting system and standardizing accounting action, which was not governing in a strict meaning; from the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the CPC to the year of 1998, government began to focus on solving the problems of disorder in the financial and economic fields by means of checking the taxation, finance and price like pulling a fishing net out of water every year. Although it produced some results, compared with the huge cost, the results was not economical, finally government decided to abandon the method of check in 1998. After then government propelled the transition from excessive governing accounting information distortion to the daily inspection of focusing on the function of government departments, and established the accounting regulatory system of organic whole of three, which focused on government regulatory, based on the internal regulatory and took the social regulatory as important elements. All these played some role for maintaining the healthy operation of the market economy and protecting the interests of the investors. However, the overlapping of the function and the law of government departments caused the excessive regulatory or insufficient regulatory, so the situation of accounting information distortion became more and more serious. This shows if government governs to excess or takes no action, accounting information distortion will not achieve effective containment. The history and reality of governing accounting information distortion prove that complete market regulation and excessive interference of government can't fundamentally solve the problem of accounting information distortion, and only choosing an appropriate method of solution can it been solved. Accounting information has commodity and social character, which has the feature of the public things, so it is feasible and necessary that government appropriately involves in solving the disorder of the accounting market. Because accounting information distortion causes social loss, government need pay the regulatory cost; meanwhile, it also achieves the return of punishment. Balancing these elements, we can get the net loss of society. When the cost of social loss, the payment of government regulatory and the return of punishment achieve a balance, the net loss of society will be the least, and governing of accounting information distortion is the most appropriate, effective and",1868724726,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, Hai ZhiZhangZhiHaiZhang, Hai Zhi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314397261 , 111114532 , 189128 , 10311583 , 10311583", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese,,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868724726?accountid=14496, 0548 Mechanical engineering, 0548 Mechanical engineering, 0548 Mechanical engineering,, 0548 Mechanical engineering, Mechanical engineering," (UMI)AAI10311583 , Applied sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+on+appropriate+scale+of+government+management+distorted+accounting+information&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Hai+Zhi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The research on mao zedong's anti-bureaucratism theory,"Translation from original language as provided by author Bureaucratism, referring to the kind of leadership styles that act as losing contact with reality and the masses and being the master of people, is a common phenomenon of the social life. It's the counter of the values of modern society such as freedom, democracy, and equality and a retarder of the development of the society, so anti-bureaucratism is an important part of the democratic revolution and social constructions. As the leader of Chinese democratic revolution and a founder of socialist construction, anti-bureaucratism is also one of the subjects of his theories all through his life. As a result, the research of his anti-bureaucratism theory has got important meanings in both the theory and the reality. Both the goal and the power of the New Democratic Revolution contain the request of anti-bureaucratism, which make a relation of cause and result. Mao Zedong took series of measures in the revolutionary procession to fight against bureaucratism which has remarkable effects, therefore, the procession armed by democracy eventually destroyed Chiang Kai-shek's new warlord rules. So the fight against anti-bureaucratism is not only the key of Mao Zedong's secret of defeating the enemy, but also configured a new model of politics, which offered a theoretical foundation for the establishment of a new country. After new China was founded, the first and foremost task is to establish and consolidate the people's democratic dictatorship, but a considerable number of the party members tainted with the bad habit of bureaucratism resulting from the rolling party's position, and broke people's democracy. In order to maintain the purity of the revolution, Mao Zedong took a lot of measures, rectification as the chief way, but the effect was not obvious, together with the complex international situation, Mao Zedong over-estimated the situation of bureaucratism, which linked to the mistake of expansion of class struggle, and finally resulted in the Cultural Revolution that plunged the country into turmoil which was launched to save the Party and the country from the danger of being changed into the capitalism. The conclusion of the experiences and lessons of Mao Zedong's efforts in the fight against anti-bureaucratism is important for our current anti-bureaucratism work. The sparkling parts of his anti-bureaucratism theory, such as valuing political education and the supervision of the masses and the ""three important styles of work"", still remains in the current socialist core value system. But simply taking the ways of ideological and political education and large-scale of mass movement would never eradicate the bureaucratism, structural reforms is the only way",1869953208,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhao, Ling LingZhaoLingLingZhao, Ling Ling",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315473301 , 70615242 , 189128 , 10526252 , 10526252", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, Chinese, Chinese,,2008,PQDT - Global,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1869953208?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," (UMI)AAI10526252 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+research+on+mao+zedong%27s+anti-bureaucratism+theory&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhao%2C+Ling+Ling&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Research on countermeasures to employment of college graduates in liaoning province,"Translation from original language as provided by author The problem of employment has already become a universal puzzle that puzzles various countries' economy development.

However along with the establishment and consummation of socialist market economy system, the transformation of government function, the establishment of guarding and the melting finance risk consciousness as well as the construction of public financial frame system, implementation the government procurement and the treasury centralized payment system and so on, there are new more request to the report system. Meanwhile the limitations of cash basis of government accounting also gradually appear, for example, the institution is not advantageous for carrying on the cost accounting,some revenue and expenditure projects don't match and could not really reflect the year surplus and so on; Financial overall budget accounting is unable completely and reasonably to reflect shares, the calculation and allocation of the social public resource, implicit debt, the social insurance fund and prevention government financial risks.

This study provides both a deep history and conceptual framework to analyze the relationship between the two phenomena in the long-standing French possession of Senegal as well as the recently established colony of French Guinea. Specifically, the dissertation examines the generative capacities of biopower (the power over life) in the fin-de-siècle period whereby new medical knowledges of smallpox melded with the initial experiments to vaccinate local African populations en masse . Colonial biopower steadlily became embedded in French West Africa through the medicalization of smallpox, particularly in terms of the statistical recording of epidemics over space and time, and the partial, yet effective creation of vaccination networks. These developments in turn helped to produce a new social constellation that redefined territory, population, and individuals and framed the broader conduct of political governance. Mass vaccination campaigns also changed the ways West African communities responded to smallpox epidemics as the vaccine gradually replaced, and in time ultimately eliminated, a precolonial form of indigenous smallpox prevention (variolation). By focusing conceptually on the early period of this little historically studied disease and its control in colonial Africa, the study maps out the historical foundations of the massive twentieth-century vaccination efforts that ultimately led to the smallpox's eradication. More generally, the dissertation responds to the challenge to write empirically rich and theoretically informed histories of Western modernity in colonial Africa and throughout European empire. It combines insights from two different thinkers on the manner in which micrological processes produce larger socio-political foundations: Michel Foucault for the arts of government and productive modes of biopower and Bruno Latour for the ways technoscientific practices assemble social relations through networks and chains. As such, the thesis contributes to the historical literature on the relationship between medicine and colonialism, the shaping of African subjectivity, the meanings and experiences of modernity, and the means in which Western knowledges move within local, non-Western settings and throughout global terrains.",193487521,,Dissertations & Theses," Hayden, Christopher EllisHaydenEllisChristopherHayden, Christopher Ellis",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1546790961 , 39689131 , 66569 , 9780549499657 , 3303521 , 3303521", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549499657, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/193487521?accountid=14496," 0331 African history , 0585 Science history"," 0331 African history , 0585 Science history"," 0331 African history , 0585 Science history",," 0331 African history , 0585 Science history"," African history , Science history"," Social sciences , Colonial medicine , French West Africa , Guinea , Senegal , Smallpox , Vaccination",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Of+medicine+and+statecraft%3A+Smallpox+and+early+colonial+vaccination+in+French+West+Africa+%28Senegal+-Guinea%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hayden%2C+Christopher+Ellis&amp;isbn=9780549499657&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“Peace is too small a word”: The life and ideas of Emily Greene Balch,"During her life, Emily Greene Balch (1867-1961) was a well-known academic and a leading figure in several movements for social reform, yet she remains little discussed figure in American history.

My research builds on Albuquerque’s arguments about the construction of o Nordeste in the twentieth century by situating them in the milieu of political and cultural debates that attempted to redefine Northeastern Brazil during the Cold War. Rural social movements (associated with the Catholic Church, the Communist Party, and the Ligas Camponesas ), large landowners, filmmakers and intellectuals, popular poets, U.S. and Brazilian politicians and journalists, and Brazilian military officers proposed projects to change the structures that they saw as perpetuating regional inequalities. To gain support for their political projects, these social, political and cultural movements appropriated regional historical symbols and narratives, imbuing them with new meanings. In doing so, they sought to redefine regional identity, and to a certain extent, also looked to redefine national and Third World identity. During the Cold War, identity expanded to becoming a product of local, national and transnational discussions, facilitated by the expansion of film as a medium of mass culture. The debates over the meaning of regional historical symbols and regional identity in Northeastern Brazil are at once an exaggerated and exemplary microcosm of Cold War political and cultural struggles in Latin America and in the Third World. The characters in the story had counterparts in other countries, and the setting was one of the most socially unequal areas in the world espousing all of the problems and possibilities of impoverished areas during the Cold War. The struggles also occurred at a key moment in Cold War history in Latin America: the era of the Cuban Revolution. But, the Northeast was not a blank slate for Cold War policies; in fact, the region had entrenched cultural symbols and historical narratives that composed the framework for the debates over regional identity.",250823545,,Dissertations & Theses," Sarzynski, Sarah R.SarzynskiR.SarahSarzynski, Sarah R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757060371 , 41089491 , 66569 , 9780549965947 , 3341426 , 3341426", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549965947, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/250823545?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history",," 0336 Latin American history , 0582 Modern history"," Latin American history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Brazil , Cold War , Ligas Camponesas , Northeastern Brazil , Rural social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=History%2C+identity+and+the+struggle+for+land+in+northeastern+Brazil%2C+1955%E2%80%931985&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sarzynski%2C+Sarah+R.&amp;isbn=9780549965947&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Cultural futuristics: Bringing consciousness to cultural complexes and soul to scenario based planning,"Futures studies came into existence in the mid-20th century in an effort to imagine how yesterday's and today's realities produce the future. Analyzing patterns and causes of change and stability from multiple interdisciplinary perspectives, futurists seek to develop maps of alternative futures. They describe these alternative future conditions by writing multiple scenarios that describe possible, probable, and preferable social, ecological, and political environments. Until now, one of the missing perspective in futures studies has been the critical contribution of depth psychology, particularly how cultural complexes, symbols, myths, and narratives create political and cultural life. This paper presents cultural futuristics, a revisioning of traditional psychoanalysis into a psychological, social-science methodology that informs scenario-based planning. Cultural futuristics is a cultural psychology that promotes transdisciplinary dialog and enables clinical findings to be implemented in scenario planning. The resulting scenarios, called future histories, reframe and return the voice of the silenced cultural soul to the future, in an attempt to mitigate the potential impact of existing, yet unexamined, volatile, cultural complexes. This effort enlightens researchers and futurists to the promise, the devastating psychological impact, and the teleological dimensions within significant critical events. Cultural futuristics treats significant cultural events, such as 9/11, global warming, and terrorism, as dream, as place, and as a client that possesses a veiled, imaginal, intersubjective ""voice"" that is attempting, through action and symptoms, to attract humanity's attention. Integrating social-science methods, psychoanalytical techniques, alchemical procedures, indigenous wisdom, and a research attitude akin to the Western Apache concept of smooth mind, cultural futuristics probes collective, cultural complexes in an effort to gain insight and, thus, foresight. Researchers using cultural futuristics reconnect superficial social, political, and cultural facades with unconscious depths, revealing what has been disguised, exiled, marginalized, and hidden from modernism's surface glance. Informed by the wisdom within the unconscious-constellated opposites, shadows, and archetypal movements of cultural events, cultural futuristics attempts to mitigate and avert future catastrophes by bringing consciousness to cultural complexes and soul to scenario planning.",275776990,,Dissertations & Theses," Glock, MichaelGlockMichaelGlock, Michael",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2030668721 , 40488781 , 66569 , 9781109728224 , 3406155 , 3406155", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109728224, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/275776990?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0422 Philosophy , 0451 Social psychology , 0790 Systems science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0422 Philosophy , 0451 Social psychology , 0790 Systems science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0422 Philosophy , 0451 Social psychology , 0790 Systems science",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0422 Philosophy , 0451 Social psychology , 0790 Systems science"," Cultural anthropology , Philosophy , Social psychology , Systems science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Applied sciences , Psychology , Consciousness , Cultural complexes , Cultural futuristics , Cultural psychology , Forecasting , Futures studies , Futuristics , Scenario planning",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultural+futuristics%3A+Bringing+consciousness+to+cultural+complexes+and+soul+to+scenario+based+planning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Glock%2C+Michael&amp;isbn=9781109728224&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Limits and morality: The emergence of human rights in America's post-Vietnam foreign policy, 1968–1981","This study explains the emergence and institutionalization of human rights in American foreign policy in the ""long 1970s"" (1968-1981). I see the rise of human rights in the U.S. as a phenomenon that resulted from four major factors: (1) The Vietnam War and the social changes of the 1960s, (2) détente, (3) the ethnic revival, and (4) executive-legislative conflict. These factors occurred alongside other domestic currents, including broad recognition of limits to American power, a resurgent conservatism, and new congressional assertiveness. The international context was also significant. American policies were heavily influenced by world events and trends, such as the crackdown on dissident activity in Eastern Europe, Soviet emigration policies, authoritarianism in Latin America, and rising nationalism. The non-government influence—including the role of NGOs, public opinion, lobbies, voters, and the news media—was also important at certain points. The narrative shows a period of nascent interest (c. 1968-72) followed by a time of rising expectations and growing institutionalization (c. 1973-78). This was then followed by a phase of diminishing expectations as advocates realized the difficulties of policy implementation (c. 1978-81). Yet although this last period saw a return to the containment doctrine and a concomitant decline in human rights rhetoric, the efforts of the mid-1970s had institutionalized the movement. The major political actors of the 1980s could not ignore the new congressional requirements or the increased public awareness of international rights violations. Three major themes emerge in the telling of this story. First, political opportunism drove much of the period's political activism. Second, political figures promoted several competing versions of morality. In response to Richard Nixon's and Henry Kissinger's perceived amorality, liberals and conservatives alike used human rights policies and rhetoric to claim the moral high ground. A third important theme is the influence of ethnic interest groups at a time in which traditional party coalitions were fracturing. Among the human rights issues publicized by American ""ethnics"" were the troubles in Northern Ireland, civil liberties in Poland, freedom of emigration for Soviet Jews, and decolonization in Africa.",275834629,,Dissertations & Theses," Renouard, JoeRenouardJoeRenouard, Joe",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1679673061 , 40253141 , 66569 , 9781109017182 , 3344496 , 3344496", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109017182, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/275834629?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0616 International law"," 0337 American history , 0616 International law"," 0337 American history , 0616 International law",," 0337 American history , 0616 International law"," American history , International law"," Social sciences , Cold War , Detente , Foreign policy , Human rights , Nineteen 70s , North/South , Transatlantic , Transatlantic relations , U.S. foreign policy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Limits+and+morality%3A+The+emergence+of+human+rights+in+America%27s%0Apost-Vietnam+foreign+policy%2C+1968%E2%80%931981&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Renouard%2C+Joe&amp;isbn=9781109017182&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Modernity, popular culture and urban life: anglophone, asians in colonial singapore, 1920-1940","As a thriving cosmopolitan port city in Southeast Asia, Singapore under British colonial rule was quick to embrace international trends in popular culture. The multiethnic, Anglophone, Asian middle-class was most influenced by new ideas and modern mass consumer technologies. In this thesis, modern popular culture is investigated through a social history surrounding various modes of mass consumer technologies which became increasingly embedded in the everyday life of Singapore’s cityscape. The local popular press and amateur associations played a key role in the promotion of new technologies and consumer tastes, which in turn provided opportunities for commercial enterprises in Singapore. The motor car brought about an important qualitative shift in the physical experience of movement, freedom of mobility and the experience of the city’s streets. The automobile was also a focus for the expression of new middle-class lifestyles and social tastes, while allowing earlier patterns of ethno-economic employment to continue. A highly cosmopolitan cinema industry also developed rapidly in Singapore, marking its presence on the city’s built landscape. Despite official attempts at censorship, vibrant public debates illustrate the cinema’s deep influence on changing social ideals, values and fashion trends especially amongst young people and women. Shortwave radio offered an even more intense experience of global cultures and the wonders of modern technology. Even as the colonial government attempted to connect the British Empire through wireless radio, broadcasting in Singapore became increasingly localised in terms of personnel involved and content. Together with gramophone records, the medium of radio developed symbiotically with other urban entertainments at the time.",301698239,,Dissertations & Theses," Chua, A. L.ChuaL.A.Chua, A.

It explores whether Nepal's donors have considered the role of education in socio-political conflict, or have reexamined their support to education in light of the violence. The study is guided by two seemingly contradictory perspectives on education. One perspective, espoused by development agencies and global movements, is that education is a benign force of social progress and modernization, while the other perspective, made evident by the role of schools in situations of violent conflict worldwide, is of education as a vehicle for hegemonic control by autocratic ruling groups and/or the transmission of the values and prejudices underlying social grievances. The dichotomy between these two perspectives is evident in Nepal. While it has not directly instigated Maoist violence, education has contributed to the perpetuation of socio-political discord and has in effect become positioned at the centre of Nepal's protracted socio-political struggle. Donor-funded education reform programs in Nepal, however, have largely ignored the country's entrenched socio-political power balance and other contextual constraints, and have therefore merely obscured the continuance of traditional structures of elite dominance while doing little to improve education quality. Even with the onset of Maoist violence, Nepal's donors do not appear to have examined the contribution of education to social discord, nor the suitability of current vehicles of educational support in the context of conflict. Although these agencies have endeavored to respond to the conflict and make their overall programs conflict-sensitive, these efforts have generally circumvented the education sector. This thesis argues that conflict has helped to illuminate in Nepal what Bush and Saltarelli (2004) refer to as the ""negative face of education"". The case of Nepal serves as further substantiation of the importance of considering the role of schools in the perpetuation of discriminatory social practices. It also underscores Davies' (2005) exhortation for an increased research emphasis on conflict-sensitivity in education, a mainstreaming of conflict analysis within education planning, as well as a reconsideration of the purpose and methods of education in an increasingly interconnected and violent world.",304315797,,Dissertations & Theses," Parker, TraceyParkerTraceyParker, Tracey",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1804960231 , 47198411 , 66569 , 9780494486436 , MR48643 , MR48643", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780494486436, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304315797?accountid=14496," 0277 Education finance , 0332 History , 0340 Educational sociology"," 0277 Education finance , 0332 History , 0340 Educational sociology"," 0277 Education finance , 0332 History , 0340 Educational sociology",," 0277 Education finance , 0332 History , 0340 Educational sociology"," Education finance , History , Educational sociology"," Social sciences , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Education%2C+conflict+%26amp%3B+development+in+Nepal%3A+Historical+precedents+%26amp%3B+modern+dynamics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Parker%2C+Tracey&amp;isbn=9780494486436&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Stakeholders' perceptions of corporate social responsibility (CSR): Case studies from Bangladesh and Pakistan,"State, civil society and businesses are among the key agents for achieving the goal of sustainable development. However, in an era of economic globalization, businesses have become more resourceful and seem to be playing a leading role. The abundant supply of cheap labour in Bangladesh and Pakistan makes them attractive to foreign as well as local investors. At the same time, these countries are facing the daunting challenges of poverty, environmental degradation, female discrimination, low labour standards, child labour, corruption and illiteracy, all of which necessitate an investigation into the level of observance of social responsibility by businesses in the two countries. The ten principles of the United Nations Global Compact and the corresponding elements adapted from the GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines have been employed by this study to devise a screening benchmark. The stakeholders' perceptions of CSR and the businesses' sensitivity in terms of having written policies on CSR have been gauged through questionnaire surveys. Sensitivity to CSR has also been measured through content analysis of CSR related information communicated by businesses on their websites. Finally, in-depth interviews with stakeholders have been carried out to ascertain the drivers for and the impediments to the observance of CSR. The study reveals that the stakeholders' awareness of CSR is in its infancy. Although most stakeholders urge businesses to comply with their social responsibility, at the individual level there is a general lack of vigilance regarding the social and environmental performance of a business entity while making investment or purchasing decisions. Most businesses in Bangladesh and Pakistan do not have written policies on CSR. Labour standards and environmental protection are areas of greater concern than those of human rights and anti-corruption. Multinational companies are far ahead of listed local companies in terms of having written policies on CSR. However, CSR elements such as monitoring of supply chains, environmental and social reporting practices, providing information to workers about HIV/AIDS, and the composition of senior management with balanced female/male ratios, are not included in the written policies of many local as well as multinational companies. The businesses in both countries are seemingly reactive rather than proactive to statutory laws. Religious obligation, brand image, foreign buyers' pressure and state laws appear to be the key driving forces in the study countries, while lack of awareness and lack of capacity, meagre profits, unrealistic prices from foreign buyers, poverty, weak and corrupt regulatory departments, and authoritative military rule appear to be impeding CSR practices. The research concludes that there is an urgent need for a widespread awareness campaign and capacity building of stakeholders, engaging the institution of religion in the CSR movement and sensitizing businesses to playing a responsible role in monitoring their supply chains. The study suggests a proactive role by the UN along with other international initiatives to engender an enabling environment for participation of all the stakeholders for the furtherance of CSR.",304316152,,Dissertations & Theses," Malik, Asghar NaeemMalikNaeemAsgharMalik, Asghar Naeem",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1647408111 , 41870281 , 66569 , 0820813 , 0820813", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304316152?accountid=14496," 0454 Management , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0454 Management , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0454 Management , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0454 Management , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Management , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Bangladesh , Corporate social responsibility , Environmental concerns , Human rights , Pakistan , Stakeholders",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Stakeholders%27+perceptions+of+corporate+social+responsibility+%28CSR%29%3A+Case+studies+from+Bangladesh+and+Pakistan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Malik%2C+Asghar+Naeem&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Frustrated peasants, marginalized workers: Free African villages in Guyana, 1838–1885","This dissertation is an attempt to recalibrate and re-orient the understanding of the history of nineteenth century Guyana out of which current social and ethnic relations emerged and can be understood. Without speaking directly to current ethnic conflict, it links it with the social and class relations that emerged in the decades after slavery ended. It posits that out of this history new thinking must emerge. Such new ways of thinking it argues must attempt to and seriously adumbrate the conjunctive role of the world sugar market which influenced Guyana’s rise to prominence as a sugar producer and the special environmental and ecological determinants, and how these shaped, over time, the particular historical and political outlook of the social relations within the state which has, in turn, consumed the sociological and political elasticity of the national space. From the background of history this work focuses on the social relations that emerged and developed on the ground as Guyana’s potential for sugar was forged in the context of slave abolition and emancipation, and the emergent concrete totality of new and forming multiple actors within the national space. It expands the breadth of the already established analytical literature which has concentrated either on the role and impact on history of the plantation, the colonial state, the village movement, the African and or the East Indian indentured servants. In extolling the role of the local and global economy in the shaping of social and ethnic relations in Guyana, it spotlights how the growth of the “second slavery” in Cuba, Brazil and the United States in the throes of the abolition of the slave trade served as an important backdrop through which the processes of African marginalization emerged and took root in Guyana. Finally, this work exposes the manner in which the sugar economy and the environment provided the means and context for the encirclement of African labor after emancipation. It exposes the limits of existing literature which assumed that a “peasantry” developed because of land availability. It thus joins in the critique of existing literature which was begun by Walter Rodney in 1978.",304323814,,Dissertations & Theses," Mohamed, WazirMohamedWazirMohamed, Wazir",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1594497931 , 40164721 , 66569 , 9780549715498 , 3320171 , 3320171", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549715498, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304323814?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0328 Black history , 0336 Latin American history , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Black history , Latin American history , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Free African , Guyana , Marginalization , Peasants , Sugar economy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Frustrated+peasants%2C+marginalized+workers%3A+Free+African+villages+in+Guyana%2C+1838%E2%80%931885&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mohamed%2C+Wazir&amp;isbn=9780549715498&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Japanese prostitutes in the Pacific Northwest, 1887–1920","This study explores the history of ameyuki-san , or Japanese women who crossed the ocean and became prostitutes in North America between 1890 and 1920. It argues that Japanese prostitutes were historical actors who resorted to various means to shape their own destinies. They ran away from exploitative masters, entered Protestant rescue missions, and divorced abusive husbands who had forced them into prostitution. This study is an attempt to reconstruct the agency of Japanese women by analyzing their efforts to challenge patriarchy and the dominant ideology of womanhood within North American Japanese communities before 1920. At the same time, this study seeks to analyze the individual stories of Japanese prostitutes from a transnational and comparative perspective by investigating changing social, economic, and political conditions in Japan, North America, and the Pacific Rim region. In so doing, this dissertation reconsiders major paradigms in Asian American history and U.S. immigration history more generally. Chapter 1 overviews the migration of ameyuki-san as a part of the dispersion of overseas Japanese prostitutes throughout the Pacific Rim region during the Meiji period (1868-1912). Chapter 2 explores the social origins of Japanese prostitutes in the Pacific Northwest by drawing on the records of more than 200 individuals (including procurers and prostitutes) gleaned from the consular reports. Chapter 3 examines the system of importing Japanese women to the Pacific Northwest for prostitution with emphasis on the role of procurers in the processes. Chapter 4 explores the violence and exploitation that Japanese prostitutes experienced after their arrival in North America. Chapter 5 analyzes ameyuki-san ’s efforts to break away from their masters and abusive husbands by turning to boyfriends, Protestant rescue missions, and divorce courts. Chapter 6 compares Japanese prostitutes responses in the Pacific Northwest and those in Japan during the same period in order to examine the validity of assimilation theories in explaining the assertive behavior of ameyuki-san . Chapter 7 examines the anti-prostitution movement and the decline of Japanese prostitution in the Pacific Northwest in the context of Japanese immigrants’ settlements in North America, American Progressive reforms, and Japan’s expansionism in Asia.",304326828,,Dissertations & Theses," Oharazeki, KazuhiroOharazekiKazuhiroOharazeki, Kazuhiro",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1609283541 , 40231871 , 66569 , 9780549714743 , 3320155 , 3320155", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549714743, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304326828?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," History , American history , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Ameyuki-san , Japanese , Pacific Northwest , Prostitutes",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Japanese+prostitutes+in+the+Pacific+Northwest%2C+1887%E2%80%931920&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Oharazeki%2C+Kazuhiro&amp;isbn=9780549714743&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Demonstrations of faith: Religious and political identity among feminist activists in North America,"This dissertation investigates political and religious identity for social justice activists, centering on women who identify both as political activists and as feminist Neo-Pagans, Catholics or United Church Protestants. Methodologically, the research is based on ethnographic interview material from individuals who understand their activism as religiously motivated and participant-observation within these three religious communities. This project places such activists in historical context as religiously motivated advocates for social change and discusses what their actions reveal about the public significance of religion in the pluralistic context of North America. This work engages many scholarly conversations, including anthropology of religion, ritual studies, political science, gender and equity studies, ethics, North American religious history, and new religious movements. Chapter 1 examines common ritual elements shared by all three groups, despite disparate institutional affiliations, and reflects on how common rites signal membership in a larger movement of faith and social justice activism. Further, it considers the kinds of selves, communities, and worlds reflected in their ritualizing. Chapter 2 engages explicit ritualizing in anti-globalization protests, exploring activists' incorporation of religion into political actions and giving insight into both mass anti-globalization demonstrations and into new ways that practitioners integrate religion and politics. Not everyone in progressive activist communities understands such integration of religious and political identity as positive and Chapter 3 explores the strategic use of the phrase “I am spiritual, but not religious,” by religiously motivated feminist activists, arguing that by embracing the language of “spirituality,” rather than “religion,” participants negotiate with secularly oriented activists to accommodate public ways of being religious. Chapter 4 focuses on participants' articulation of an ethical system based on a cosmology of interrelationship. This ethical system of “social justice” reflects connections between the self and global community and includes the well being of the individual in determining the value of particular actions. This chapter explores the types of projects such a worldview supports and engages current feminist debates about agency and resistance. Lastly, it considers what implications a social justice cosmology has for understandings of “the political.”",304355922,,Dissertations & Theses," Zwissler, LaurelZwisslerLaurelZwissler, Laurel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1659964721 , 40487161 , 66569 , 9780494448144 , NR44814 , NR44814", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780494448144, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304355922?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Womens studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Activists , Feminist , North America , Political identity , Religious identity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Demonstrations+of+faith%3A+Religious+and+political+identity+among+feminist+activists+in+North+America&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zwissler%2C+Laurel&amp;isbn=9780494448144&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Differences among subjects in a pharmaceutical clinical trial as determined by recruitment method,"Traditionally, physicians have recruited clinical trial subjects, however, pharmaceutical companies have become involved in this process. To understand the practical application for using pharmaceutical recruitment in addition to physician recruitment and whether it adds to the overall effort and quality of subjects, this study tested the differences between these recruitment efforts regarding characteristics involving enrollment, compliance, completion, physiological, and psychological aspects of subjects. Data from a Phase 3 clinical trial involving subjects with Irritable Bowel Syndrome were retrospectively evaluated using a quasi-experimental design. Using either the specified t test or Fisher's Exact Test, the data indicated that both recruitment methods found similar subjects for enrollment ( p = 0.0743), treatment compliance ( p = 0.1468), clinical trial completion ( p = 0.2002), and psychological assessment ( p = 0.9994). Physiological symptoms were mixed with similar finding for the composite symptom score ( p = 0.6039) of abdominal bloating, abdominal discomfort, straining, and stool consistency, but different for bowel movement frequency ( p = 0.0017) with pharmaceutical-recruited subjects averaging about one bowel movement more per week. The social change implications of these findings suggest the use of both physician and pharmaceutical efforts in subject recruitment. Since physicians are vital to the clinical trial, the pharmaceutical efforts help shift some of the recruitment demands away from the site allowing the site to focus on subject evaluations. Together, both efforts create a representative population for the global good by allowing a clinical trial to better reflect postapproval usage and minimize the potential of a postapproval recall of a drug.",304381225,,Dissertations & Theses," Panas, Raymond MichaelPanasMichaelRaymondPanas, Raymond Michael",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1472642301 , 39069971 , 66569 , 9780549367857 , 3291473 , 3291473", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549367857, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304381225?accountid=14496, 0573 Public health, 0573 Public health, 0573 Public health,, 0573 Public health," Public health , Pharmaceuticals , Clinical trials , Professional recruitment"," Health and environmental sciences , Advertising , Characteristics , Clinical trials , Pharmaceutical , Recruitment , Subject",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Differences+among+subjects+in+a+pharmaceutical+clinical+trial+as+determined+by+recruitment+method&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Panas%2C+Raymond+Michael&amp;isbn=9780549367857&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A cult of the individual for a global society: The development and worldwide expansion of human rights ideology,"Despite ongoing attention to the subject, scholarly efforts have failed to adequately explain the tremendous, worldwide expansion of human rights over the course of the 20 th century. Prevailing accounts employ a variety of mechanisms to explain this phenomenon, such as evolutionary progress, functional necessity, hegemonic coercion, interest maximization, or social movement activity. These accounts, however, are empirically inadequate. Based on a comprehensive coding of 779 human rights instruments, I present an unprecedented portrayal of the global institutionalization of human rights since the mid-19 th century. Using this quantitative data as well as historical research on the cultural origins of this ideology, I critically evaluate prevailing theories of human rights expansion, highlighting both their strengths and weaknesses as explanatory frameworks. In the process, I develop an alternative world-cultural account that stresses the rationalized construction of human rights as an element of the long-term rise of the universal, egalitarian individual as the primary entity of social organization, value, and meaning in world society.

There were more than 600 BIDs in the U.S. in 2008 and an estimated 1,500 worldwide (International Downtown Association, 2008). BIDs are special districts established at the local level of government to bring together public, private and civic actors to address necessary revitalization, economic development and quality of life improvements in a designated business area. BIDS are unique because they are established by local ordinance, usually managed and overseen by private as well as public agents and funded through a special assessment. They offer an avenue of public impact, participation and organization for invested private actors. The BID partnership represents a movement past the traditional adversarial relationship often experienced between government and business and the beginning of a legal partnership that utilizes the strengths and offsets the weaknesses of each sector. Such partnerships allow the public sector to enjoy more vigorous entrepreneurship, while allowing the private sector to utilize public authority and processes to achieve economic and community revitalization. Thus, the public sector takes on private aspects and the private sector takes on a measure of public responsibility. This paper addresses the ""publicization"" process in which private sector actors take on public accountabilities and begin to dissolve the public-private dichotomy to create a new hybrid capacity for mutually beneficial community and business development. This new capacity is notably entrepreneurial and acts as a third option for achieving economic and social stability and success. This research examined, through interviews and a survey of the universe of U.S. BIDs, the role of entrepreneurship in public private partnerships through the eyes of the business improvement district manager who sits at the nexus of the public-private partnership that business improvement districts (BIDs) represent. The research findings indicated that entrepreneurship, when associated with public-private partnerships (3Ps), was strongly associated with social capital to create a bridging form of public management that explores, identifies, and crafts community values to revitalize a sense of destination and place in traditional and non-traditional business districts. Implications for public policy and administration included that: (a) entrepreneurship can have public application; (b) entrepreneurship informs us that the management techniques of public-private ventures has the capacity to be transformative and horizontal; (c) traditional entrepreneurship characteristics associated with social capital describe the public management entrepreneur: and (d) the mutual trust building aspects of public entrepreneurship transcend the rational actor associated with traditional business mindedness and develops the attributes of a transrational actor with strategic community-oriented business skills. These findings could provide new tools for describing public entrepreneurship in public administration necessary to bridge special interests and formulate sustainable social and economic networks.",304387225,,Dissertations & Theses," Grossman, Seth AndrewGrossmanAndrewSethGrossman, Seth Andrew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1595581491 , 41053921 , 66569 , 9780549791515 , 3326980 , 3326980", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549791515, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304387225?accountid=14496," 0454 Management , 0617 Public administration"," 0454 Management , 0617 Public administration"," 0454 Management , 0617 Public administration",," 0454 Management , 0617 Public administration"," Management , Public administration , Entrepreneurship , Public private partnerships , Economic development , Business improvement districts , Polls & surveys , Social capital , Public policy , Studies"," Social sciences , Business Improvement District , Entrepreneurship , Public entrepreneurship , Public management , Public-private partnership , Social capital",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+role+of+entrepreneurship+in+public-private+partnerships%3A+The+case+of+Business+Improvement+Districts&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grossman%2C+Seth+Andrew&amp;isbn=9780549791515&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"An evaluation of energy consumption and emissions from intermodal freight operations on the Eastern Seaboard: A GIS network analysis approach,"As global trade continues to increase, the energy and environmental impacts of freight movement in the US have become more of a concern. As such, the freight transport system needs to consider opportunities to meet customer objectives, while also meeting social goals. In the US there has been legislation enacted to address the growing impact that freight movement has on the environment, but there are limited tools to assist in the implementation of those polices. This research sets forth a process for creating a geospatial intermodal freight transportation (GIFT) model within ArcGIS that can be used to analyze freight movement under different economic and environmental scenarios. The GIFT model uses an intermodal network that connects various modes (rail, truck, and ship) via intermodal terminals. ArcGIS Network Analyst is used to create the intermodal network and conduct optimal route analysis for various network attributes. Routes along the network are characterized not only by temporal and distance attributes, but also by cost, energy, and emissions attributes. Decision makers can use the model to explore tradeoffs among alternative route selection across different modal combinations, and to identify optimal routes for objectives that feature energy and environmental parameters (e.g., least carbon dioxide intensive route). The research illustrates the use of this network using a case study that analyzes freight traffic along the US Eastern Seaboard.",304388577,,Dissertations & Theses," Falzarano, AaronFalzaranoAaronFalzarano, Aaron",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1605156321 , 41216321 , 66569 , 9780549841487 , 1457477 , 1457477", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549841487, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304388577?accountid=14496," 0709 Transportation planning , 0768 Environmental science , 0791 Energy"," 0709 Transportation planning , 0768 Environmental science , 0791 Energy"," 0709 Transportation planning , 0768 Environmental science , 0791 Energy",," 0709 Transportation planning , 0768 Environmental science , 0791 Energy"," Transportation planning , Environmental science , Energy"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Applied sciences , Emissions , Energy , Freight , Gis , Intermodal , Transportation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+evaluation+of+energy+consumption+and+emissions+from+intermodal+freight+operations+on+the+Eastern+Seaboard%3A+A+GIS+network+analysis+approach&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Falzarano%2C+Aaron&amp;isbn=9780549841487&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"At home or away: Travel and death in 2 Corinthians 1–9,"This dissertation is the first extensive interpretation of the Pauline letter preserved in 2 Cor 1-9 (omitting 6:15-7:1) as a series of travel motifs—especially of motifs relating travel to social shame and death. The study contributes to debates over the literary composition of the canonical letter 2 Corinthians as well as the unique style of the letter, in which Paul employs a series of unexplained images. Most of these images respond to the frame of the letter, a common epistolary travel apology which Paul has innovated by using demagogic rhetoric and the language of the wise self-consoler facing death. Following this travelogue, Paul figuratively depicts himself as a cultic practitioner in a divine triumph, a courier, a heavenly traveler, and an ambassador, before turning to recommend his fellow travelers and depict his vision of the international Jesus movement as united through his traveling work on behalf of the collection for Jerusalem. Taking recourse to contemporary, post-Marxist theories concerning the rhetorical work of building new social movements, I show how Paul uses travel as a ""floating"" or ""traveling signifier,"" specific enough to communicate his vision of apostleship, yet vague enough to engage the diverse expectations and suspicions among his community. The ambivalent connotations of travel among ancient Greeks and Romans allowed Paul to address the shameful and risky aspects of his wanderings and rehabilitate them as expressions of self-sacrifice on behalf of his communities. By successively articulating his self-image through various types of travel motifs, Paul rhetorically delineates the concept ""apostle"" and the ideological boundaries of his communities.",304390508,,Dissertations & Theses," Marquis, Timothy LuckritzMarquisLuckritzTimothyMarquis, Timothy Luckritz",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1552221531 , 40247111 , 66569 , 9780549655244 , 3317164 , 3317164", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549655244, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304390508?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0321 Biblical studies , 0579 Ancient history"," 0318 Religion , 0321 Biblical studies , 0579 Ancient history"," 0318 Religion , 0321 Biblical studies , 0579 Ancient history",," 0318 Religion , 0321 Biblical studies , 0579 Ancient history"," Religion , Biblical studies , Ancient history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Ancient religion , Corinthians 2 , Death , New social movements , Paul, the Apostle, Saint , Rhetoric , Travel",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=At+home+or+away%3A+Travel+and+death+in+2+Corinthians+1%E2%80%939&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Marquis%2C+Timothy+Luckritz&amp;isbn=9780549655244&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Saving segregation: *Southern whites, civil rights, and the roots of massive resistance, 1936–1954","The segregationist movement that stifled racial reform and captivated national attention in the wake of the Brown decision was no knee-jerk insurgency. While historians of the civil rights era have increasingly paid attention to segregationist strategy and rhetoric, the classic works and emerging studies that do exist generally date organized white resistance from the Brown decision. Yet the tumultuous two decades preceding the Brown decision demonstrates that the struggle to determine Jim Crow's fate was well underway by 1954. During the New Deal years, conservative white southerners stepped up their racial critique of the Roosevelt administration. As the African American freedom struggle took aim at segregation during World War II, white southerners caught a glimpse of the coming civil rights revolution. Overwhelmingly, they affirmed their allegiance to a segregated social order and aligned the global struggle against fascism with their defense of sacred southern traditions. When the war ended, defenders of segregation resisted racial change with a variety of strategies, from terrorism to reform. Emphasizing the national scope of the American racial dilemma, southern conservatives sought the sympathies and support of the northern public in their battle to preserve a segregated social order. In the decade after World War II, white southerners utilized a variety of strategies, from violence and racial propaganda to electoral insurgency and educational equalization to forestall racial reform. As desegregation suits worked their way through the courts and activists applied pressure from below, white southerners anticipated greater struggles ahead. Fashioning themselves as beleaguered defenders of traditional American values, segregationists struggled to replace reactionary racism with a language of constitutional conservatism. But even as segregationists worked to align their struggle with a national reawakening on the Right, the between radicalism and respectability was never impermeable. The segregationist movement that emerged in the wake of Brown reflected both the violent tendencies and white supremacist beliefs of an earlier era as well as the ""respectable"" arguments of constitutionality, freedom, and cultural self-determination that southern political leaders honed in the civil rights battles of the preceding decades.",304396122,,Dissertations & Theses," Ward, Jason MorganWardMorganJasonWard, Jason Morgan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1672026141 , 40240201 , 66569 , 9780549978077 , 3342735 , 3342735", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549978077, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304396122?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," Black history , American history"," Social sciences , Civil rights , Jim Crow , Politics , Racism , Segregation , Segregationist , Southern , Whites",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Saving+segregation%3A++*Southern+whites%2C+civil+rights%2C+and+the+roots+of+massive+resistance%2C+1936%E2%80%931954&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ward%2C+Jason+Morgan&amp;isbn=9780549978077&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The empire within: Montreal, the sixties, and the forging of a radical imagination","This thesis explores the wide variety of ways in which radical intellectuals and activists in Montreal used and adapted Third World decolonization theory to build a broad movement of solidarity and anti-colonial resistance from 1963-1972. Beginning in the early 1960s, activists and intellectuals in Montreal began drawing upon the language of Third World decolonization to resituate their understandings of themselves, their society, and the world in which they inhabited. Through their engagement with Third World liberation theory – and the closely related language of Black Power – radical intellectuals in Montreal sought to give new meaning to the old conception of humanism, and they worked to drastically expand the geographical frame of reference in which Quebec politics were generally understood. After analyzing the shifting meaning of decolonization in the period leading up to the late 1960s, this thesis explores the ways in which various groups adopted, built upon, challenged, and shaped the conception of Quebec liberation. Montreal's advocates of women's liberation, the city's Black activists, defenders of unilingualism, and labour radicals were all deeply shaped by the intellectual and urban climate of Montreal, and by ideas of Quebec decolonization. They developed their own individual narratives of liberation, yet linked by the flexible language of decolonization, these narratives all greatly overlapped, forming a vast movement which was larger than the sum of its parts. If the concept of decolonization was extremely powerful, however, it was also highly ambiguous and contradictory, and activists only slowly came to an understanding of the multi-layered nature of colonialism in Quebec. By the early 1970s, the idea of decolonization was slowly abandoned by those advocating radical social change in the city. This thesis makes three interrelated arguments. First, it argues that radicalism in Quebec in the 1960s cannot be understood outside of the larger international context in which it emerged. Second, it attempts to rethink the ways in which different groups and movements during the 1960s interacted and fed upon each other's analyses and learned from each other. And, finally, by looking at the centrality of Third World decolonization to the development of dissent in Montreal, it hopes to add new perspectives to the growing field of international Sixties scholarship, by insisting that history of the ‘West’ was profoundly shaped by its interactions with the Third World.",304398831,,Dissertations & Theses," Mills, Sean WilliamMillsWilliamSeanMills, Sean William",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1490075451 , 39374941 , 66569 , 9780494370902 , NR37090 , NR37090", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780494370902, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304398831?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0509 Economic history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0509 Economic history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0509 Economic history",," 0334 Canadian history , 0509 Economic history"," Canadian history , Economic history"," Social sciences , Montreal , Nineteen60s , Quebec , Radical imagination , Third World decolonization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+empire+within%3A+Montreal%2C+the+sixties%2C+and+the+forging+of+a+radical+imagination&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mills%2C+Sean+William&amp;isbn=9780494370902&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Thresholds of hospitality in Dutch-Surinamese relations, 1667–2000","Hosts and guests are in league by the movement of one's crossing a threshold, of entering upon invitation or of transgressing a boundary.

Hospitality permeates Dutch-Surinamese social and political history; forces of travel and movement have compelled individual subjects to decide on which side of the host/guest line they will fall—though always with some ambiguity. This decision comes with subjective reflection on the part of participants; their individualized understandings of self, nationhood, and belonging.

This dissertation is an ethnographic exploration of how the authority and legitimacy of the international community came to be conceptualized, exercised, and transformed through every-day practices of ""intervention"" in Bosnia's postwar refugee return process. More than merely the movement of refugee populations to their prewar homes, this process was taken as a transformative one, the vehicle to create a state built upon multi-ethnic forms of democracy and transparent institutions and processes. This dissertation begins with an analysis of how foreign state-building goals were promoted through the recontextualization of a socialist-era concept of sovereign peoplehood, resulting in unanticipated social effects. I then proceed with three case studies of what I call ""the politics of impartiality,"" first through an analysis of foreigners' inability to transcend the ideology of ethnic difference, second by tracking their attempts to delineate and police a space for ""humanitarian"" action, and third by exploring practices designed to render Bosnian social life ""transparent"" and available for transformation. Throughout I argue that the exercise of authority and the claiming of legitimacy were fraught because that legitimacy relied upon the ability of foreigners to embody and demonstrate the neutrality, impartiality, morality, and modernity that supposedly set them apart from the Bosnians they were to mediate between and transform. These sources of authority were often nothing more than ideologized distinctions between ""international"" and local, the universal and particular, Europe and the Balkans, the moral and political, and the traditional and the modern, and frequently proved easy to undo. Moreover, these distinctions produced their own contradictions when confronted with the actual history, politics, and people that made up the intervention encounter. What was at stake, then, was the attempt to fix the international community's authority in a context where this fixity was constantly being questioned by Bosnians who sought to remake the intervention encounter in their own terms.",304435675,,Dissertations & Theses," Gilbert, AndrewGilbertAndrewGilbert, Andrew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1631218221 , 39055831 , 66569 , 9780549928379 , 3338346 , 3338346", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549928379, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304435675?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0616 International law"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0616 International law"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0616 International law",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0335 European history , 0616 International law"," Cultural anthropology , European history , International law"," Social sciences , Balkans , Bosnia and Herzegovina , Foreign authority , International intervention , Postsocialism , Postwar , State-building",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Foreign+authority+and+the+politics+of+impartiality+in+postwar+Bosnia+-Herzegovina&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gilbert%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=9780549928379&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Racing the question: Israel /Palestine and U.S. imperial culture,"This dissertation explores how representations of Israel/Palestine became lodged in contemporary United States imperial culture. From the figure of the “city on the hill” forward, these representations produced a variety of settler-colonial and messianic narratives. In the early post-civil rights period (1963-1978), a wide range of culture workers augmented these narratives to codify, clarify, and contest shifts in U.S. race-making. Drawing on the work of Foucault, Du Bois, and Said, I reveal how post-civil rights representations of Israel/Palestine and “permanent war” both informed and challenged the racial logic of neoconservatism, the ghettoization of African Americans, and the growing demonization of Arabs and Palestinians. Chapter One traces the long cultural history shaping American visions of the “Holy Land” and Israel/Palestine. I propose the term “destinarian exceptionalism” to capture the ideological join formed by claims of American and Zionist national uniqueness and their production of exceptional racialized spaces and subjects. Chapter Two analyzes how several Jewish American intellectuals and their interlocutors (Podhoretz, Moynihan, Kahane, Bellow, and Waskow) linked representations of the June 1967 War to domestic social struggle and the Nazi holocaust that obscured the complicity of liberalism and racism. I argue that claims to Jewish universalism in the U.S. (Jewish assimilation epitomizing the “universal” values of American pluralism) and Jewish particularism in Israel (Jewish uniqueness epitomizing the necessity for Israel) operated through a relationship of historical reciprocity, revealing an enduring transnational racial geography. Chapter Three argues that Black Power movements produced an imaginative geography that linked critique of imperial race-making processes and struggles for freedom in the U.S., Palestine, and Israel. These works (by SNCC, Black Panthers, and David Graham Du Bois) departed from the Afro-diasporic Zionism informing earlier black politics by representing the colonial conditions shaping Palestinian life. Chapter Four considers how Palestinian culture work circulating in the U.S. gained a fugitive legibility in the wake of the 1967 War. It locates the emergence of Said's Orientalism in counterpoint to Arab American intellectual production, Foucault's Tunisian experience of the 1967 War, the racial fetishization of Kahlil Gibran, and the popularized construction of the “Arab terrorist.”",304439580,,Dissertations & Theses," Feldman, Keith P.FeldmanP.KeithFeldman, Keith P.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1606540201 , 39374721 , 66569 , 9780549815785 , 3328394 , 3328394", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549815785, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304439580?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0323 American studies , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American studies , Middle Eastern history , American literature , Ethnic studies , Culture , Imperialism , Israel , Palestinian territory"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Arab-American , Arab-American studies , Cultural studies , Israel/Palestine , Post-1945 history and culture , Postcoloniality , Race/ethnicity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Racing+the+question%3A+Israel+%2FPalestine+and+U.S.+imperial+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Feldman%2C+Keith+P.&amp;isbn=9780549815785&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Ethnic NewsWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Julius Nyerere and the establishment of sovereignty in Tanganyika,"Julius Nyerere is commonly known as an idealistic, if naïve, politician who led Tanganyika to a peaceful independence in 1961 at the helm of the Tanganyika African National Union (TANU) and then turned the country into an influential presence on the international stage with his ideology of African Socialism while driving it into poverty with misguided economic policies and forced villagization. This ubiquitous narrative is driven by the modernization thesis, highlighting Nyerere's failure to bring democracy and development. A revisisionist thesis is needed. The intellectual vectors of his era suggest that the first task at hand was to establish a credible sovereignty, and that Nyerere's success in this task during the first years of independence made possible the half century of internal peace that has followed. The establishment of sovereignty in Tanganyika entailed a proactive engagement with both African and European conceptions of sovereign authority. The consensual urge toward unified authority that marked pre-colonial politics in the region, the allocation of land as an attribute of political authority, and the organization of political authority through age-graded social structures all found expression in Nyerere's policies—in the one-party system, villagization, and military reform. At the same time, the Utilitarian philosophy that shaped British colonialism and the United Nations upset textbook notions of sovereign authority. Nyerere's policies and rhetoric simultaneously addressed both local cultural concerns as well as the demands of membership in the international community. Equally Nyerere understood that the laws and structures established at independence would serve as a repository for the egalitarian and non-racial ideology that he believed was the only path towards stable nationhood for Tanganyika. Nyerere cautiously exercised government authority in support of an energetic political campaign to marginalize a restive labor movement and bitter racialist sentiment. His most unabashed use of executive authority, after the army mutiny of 1964, came only after evidence emerged of a targeted plot by racialist elements within the labor movement to violently overthrow the government, an act that would have undermined prospects for both democracy and development.",304447818,,Dissertations & Theses," Bjerk, PaulBjerkPaulBjerk, Paul",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1690967031 , 41147421 , 66569 , 9781109044690 , 3349115 , 3349115", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109044690, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304447818?accountid=14496," 0331 African history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0331 African history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0331 African history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0331 African history , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," African history , Political science , Social structure"," Social sciences , Nyerere, Julius , Political history , Postcolonial , Postcolonial history , Sovereignty , Tanganyika , Tanganyika history , Tanzania , Tanzania history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Julius+Nyerere+and+the+establishment+of+sovereignty+in+Tanganyika&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bjerk%2C+Paul&amp;isbn=9781109044690&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Dixie West: Race, migration, and the color lines in Jim Crow Houston","""Dixie West"" examines the era of legal segregation in Houston, Texas and argues that, in the first half of the twentieth century, rural-to-urban and transnational migrations destabilized racial authority and racial categories in U.S. cities. Between the years 1910 and 1950, Houston transformed from a black and white city into a multiethnic metropolis as the population increased from 79,000 to 600,000. The movement of people into and within Houston complicated white supremacy and the very meanings of race. Using manuscript collections, oral histories, and census data, ""Dixie West"" focuses on the experiences of people of color who built communities and competed for power in the city. African Americans, the largest non-Anglo group in Jim Crow-era Houston, fought legal segregation and racial violence from white police officers and Ku Klux Klansmen who tried to control black people and black spaces. People of Mexican descent, including Tejanos and Mexicanos, negotiated race relations in a city where segregation laws divided people along a black and white binary. Likewise, the law designated Creoles of Color from Louisiana as ""negroes,"" but their attempts to carve out spaces for themselves show that their identity could not be circumscribed by their legal classification. The growth of the African American, Mexican American, and Creole populations altered politics, labor, and culture in the city. As Houston's population grew and diversified, distinct racial hierarchies developed in neighborhoods, political and social institutions, and places of work and play. This dissertation specifically examines three types of racialized spaces in the city: spaces of conflict where Houstonians competed for power and authority; spaces of autonomy erected by migrants in an effort to avoid the worst effects of discrimination; and spaces of cross-racial/cross-ethnic sharing where people of color cooperated with one another. Interactions that occurred between diverse Houstonians demonstrate that people living in the age of legal segregation negotiated several sets of color lines. Furthermore, the story of segregation in Houston demonstrates that ""Jim Crow"" itself was actually a multiethnic/multiracial affair.",304447967,,Dissertations & Theses," Steptoe, Tyina LeaneiceSteptoeLeaneiceTyinaSteptoe, Tyina Leaneice",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1544991731 , 40190661 , 66569 , 9780549635871 , 3314354 , 3314354", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549635871, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304447967?accountid=14496," 0325 African Americans , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," 0325 African Americans , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," 0325 African Americans , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic Americans",," 0325 African Americans , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic Americans"," African Americans , Black history , American history , Hispanic Americans"," Social sciences , African-American , Creole , Houston , Mexican-American , Segregation , Texas",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dixie+West%3A+Race%2C+migration%2C+and+the+color+lines+in+Jim+Crow+Houston&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Steptoe%2C+Tyina+Leaneice&amp;isbn=9780549635871&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""“Looking to the government”: Community, politics and the production of memory and silences in twentieth-century Peru, Ayacucho","This dissertation explores from a cultural and linguistic standpoint the political process in the relationship between the state and indigenous communities of Ayacucho, Peru, throughout the twentieth-century.

Even though it is a non-revenue generating, expensive and undesirable exercise, it is an integral part of an overall efficient global transportation system, which balances demand and supply of empty containers between regions. Empty containers are repositioned at three levels - global, inter-regional and regional-level. The focus of this dissertation is at the regional level of empty container repositioning. Regional repositioning of empty containers involves empty container movement between regional importers, marine terminals, empty container depots, and export customers. This chain movement generates excessive unproductive empty vehicle miles in a region. The problem of empty vehicle miles travelled becomes more prominent when empty container depots are located close to the port and import and export customers are inland. Stakeholders incur large system costs in repositioning empty containers between the regional import-export business locations and the port/depots. Regions with high import activity are concerned with the increase in containerized trade volumes and the persistent trade imbalance because of the capacity shortfall at their existing depots. This thesis addresses the above two regional concerns of excessive empty vehicle miles and empty container storage capacity shortfall by proposing an 'Inland-Depots-for-Empty-Containers (IDEC)' system. It recommends opening new empty container depots inland in the region, closer to high volume import-export customer clusters, in addition to the depots currently being located near the ports. The dissertation discusses the feasibility, viability, and effectiveness of the proposed system. It develops mathematical models for the IDEC system to determine the optimal number and location of inland depots in a given region under deterministic and stochastic demand patterns. Exploiting the structure of the NP-hard problem, it develops a heuristic based on the randomized rounding algorithm to solve large scale, realistic depot-location problems. To implement a successful and sustainable IDEC system, it explicitly considers the varied perspectives of different maritime stakeholders involved in the container movement. Based on the models and quantitative analyses, it demonstrates that an IDEC system has great potential in improving regional empty moves, increasing both business profitability and social welfare simultaneously.",304453093,,Dissertations & Theses," Mittal, NehaMittalNehaMittal, Neha",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1688653671 , 41358711 , 66569 , 9781109062731 , 3349923 , 3349923", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109062731, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304453093?accountid=14496," 0543 Civil engineering , 0547 Ocean engineering"," 0543 Civil engineering , 0547 Ocean engineering"," 0543 Civil engineering , 0547 Ocean engineering",," 0543 Civil engineering , 0547 Ocean engineering"," Civil engineering , Ocean engineering"," Applied sciences , Container management , Empty containers , Facility locations , Inland depots",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Regional+empty+marine+container+management&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mittal%2C+Neha&amp;isbn=9781109062731&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Communities in transition: A mixed-methods study of changing social settings and individual, household, and community well-being in post-conflict northern Uganda","This study investigated the feasibility of conducting social ecology research in a post-conflict setting with mass internal displacement. A mixed-methods research design was used to investigate changing social and physical environments and well-being as internally displaced persons in northern Uganda began to leave large camps and return to their villages of origin or resettle elsewhere in the region. Data collection methods included household surveys ( n = 548), in-depth interviews ( n = 98), and a youth Photovoice project. Innovative approaches to sampling involved geospatial technologies (GT) and a village-led household enumeration effort. Photovoice, GT, and village leader projects each included participatory components. Findings include (a) lessons learned about the process of using GT to learn about communities, build relationships, and pursue opportunities for social action; (b) results of a pilot study suggesting that village leaders are capable, willing, and rational data collectors; (c) a local history of migration and current trends suggesting that movement out of camps was underestimated by international agencies and misrepresented as a 'resettlement-oriented' process; (d) data on household return experiences depicting a process not characterized by community coordination; (e) qualitative support for the construct of psychological sense of community (PSOC) as defined by McMillan and Chavis (1986); (f) null results of a confirmatory factor analysis of the Sense of Community Index as a measure of PSOC; (g) evidence that PSOC may moderate the relationship between war experiences and symptoms of depression and anxiety; and (h) results of a student Photovoice project that describe this unfolding period of transition and reveal often overlooked community strengths. Results of this study suggest that social ecology research in this context is feasible; in particular, participatory methods were found to improve data quality.

Using a critical theoretical framework and a multimethod approach for qualitative analysis, the study explores the ways in which the media have contributed to conservative educational mobilization by empowering and legitimizing experts who favor marked-based educational policies and by excluding and muting dissenting voices. Drawing on the the political-sociological analysis of globalization and educational policy advanced by critical theorists as well as selected analytical tools borrowed from media and cultural studies, the thesis identifies four main ideological strands that have mingled to form the emerging dominant educational discourse in contemporary Brazil: human capital theory, the ideology of meritocracy, cultural deficit theory, and managerialism. By creating a new common sense around this set of ideologies, coalesced by the neo-liberal project, the mainstream media have played a pivotal role in shaping the debate and framing national educational policies according to market-driven global models. By conceiving the media as a strategic site of struggle over meanings and symbolic representations, the study also considers how counter-hegemonic social movements and progressive political actors can challenge dominant frames and advance a more democratic vision of education and society.",304458270,,Dissertations & Theses," Motter, PaulinoMotterPaulinoMotter, Paulino",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1689116651 , 40186901 , 66569 , 9781109046441 , 3348832 , 3348832", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109046441, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304458270?accountid=14496," 0514 School administration , 0617 Public administration , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0514 School administration , 0617 Public administration , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0514 School administration , 0617 Public administration , 0727 Curriculum development",," 0514 School administration , 0617 Public administration , 0727 Curriculum development"," School administration , Public administration , Curriculum development"," Social sciences , Education , Brazil , Cardoso government , Education , Education and globalization , Education and media , Educational policy , Educational reform in Brazil , Legitimation , Lula government , Media , Policy formation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+role+of+the+media+in+educational+policy+formation+and+legitimation+in+Brazil%3A+1995%E2%80%932008&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Motter%2C+Paulino&amp;isbn=9781109046441&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Urban complexity: A holistic approach to the design of cities,"Cites are ever changing complex environments that function based on multifaceted systems including social, economic and cultural issues paired with the spatial, historical and movement based problems architects typically address. However, the current approaches to analyzing cities are not adept to multifaceted systems. Simulations tend to focus on single issues and only address the physical aspects of the city. The physical city is only a small part of what makes ""good"" space. Simply making spaces that work does not necessarily mean that they are good and beneficial socially. Cities are seen as large conglomerates of people and structures when in reality it is many small local connections grouped together. These local connections are the defining factor of cities, including: how neighborhoods interact with each other, the density of uses, local typologies, the cultural context of the city, years of historical build-up, etc. Thus the real problem becomes the Global cities defining relationships at the Local level and the Local relationships ability to fit into a Global scheme. With the understanding that spatial configurations are the critical components for physically determining how urban systems perform, this creates a starting point for analysis of the city. For successful revitalization of the urban fabric, the physical spatial configuration itself must be resolved and integrated to enable the essential issues of increased density, movement, socio-economic integrity, cultural identity, environmental sustainability, and thus lead to communal well-being. Using software developed by Space Syntax, to analyze real spatial configurations through the use of configurational analysis, one can begin to see where the street fabric is failing or working in the way it is intended. The road configuration is only one part of the urban infrastructure. It is a vital part, but all other aspects of the infrastructure need to be addressed including all forms of movement and the complex networks that allow all other functions of the city to take place i.e. power, public transportation, sewage, etc. Infrastructure is typically laid out without regard to the passage of time and the incomplete nature of urban planning itself. Infrastructure requires adaptation and flexibility. Once infrastructure is addressed, there are specific local contextual problems to solve. This is where many urban designs go wrong. We tend to design space based on these one dimensional simulations and how we ""think"" the space will perform. There needs to be a method or system of tools used for addressing the issues involved in the complexities of the city. Coupling urban design theory and critical theory with many types of simulation and date we can begin to propose solutions that address the multifaceted city. With my thesis I would like to answer two questions. How can understanding solutions within an urban context be increased when the complexities are so far beyond comprehension? How can we address all the complexities of the city when we design to create ""good"" space?",304465056,,Dissertations & Theses," Dockter, BenjaminDockterBenjaminDockter, Benjamin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1594490071 , 41032921 , 66569 , 9780549729228 , 1456852 , 1456852", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549729228, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304465056?accountid=14496," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development",," 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning , 0999 Area planning & development"," Architecture , Urban planning , Area planning & development"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Urban+complexity%3A+A+holistic+approach+to+the+design+of+cities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dockter%2C+Benjamin&amp;isbn=9780549729228&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Fade in, crossroads: The *southern cinema, 1890–1940","This dissertation utilizes an interdisciplinary approach to the cinema to consider the U.S. South in national and global contexts during the first half of the twentieth century. It is as much a narrative of modernist awakening through the encounters between southerners and motion pictures, and between the rest of the world and myths and images of the South, as it is an analysis of the mutual emergence of Jim Crow segregation and the American cinema. Chapters address such key topics as independent southern filmmaking and moviegoing traditions from the early silent era through the mid-twentieth century, the film work of southern literary figures from William Faulkner to Zora Neale Hurston, the long life of Civil War memory on film, the rise and fall of the African American “race film” industry, the prolific production of lynching films across the period, and the impact of southern film censorship and regulation on the development of the medium. Broadly uniting these topics is the argument that the South and the cinema were intimately entwined and mutually influential: motion pictures contributed in myriad ways to the modernization of the region—its politics, economics, and social history—while segregation, the modern South’s defining social and cultural institution, gave the emerging medium and industry perhaps their most important metaphor and organizing principle. Focusing on the social and media networks that emerged across a half-century of migration and modernization, this work makes connections between regional developments and concerns of national and even global scope, and explores the complex and far-reaching significance of the South’s modernity and modernism across movements in art and politics. From Booker T. Washington’s industrial films and D. W. Griffith’s early Civil War one-reelers to Faulkner’s mercenary screenwriting sojourns in Hollywood and North Carolina filmmaker H. Lee Waters’s avant-garde documentaries during the Great Depression, the southern cinema registered an extraordinary range of southern responses to the challenges of the modern world, and fashioned many of the possibilities and limitations American culture continues to deal with today.",304467103,,Dissertations & Theses," Jackson, Robert AndrewJacksonAndrewRobertJackson, Robert Andrew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1801471471 , 39239691 , 66569 , 9781109223422 , 3362836 , 3362836", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109223422, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304467103?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0700 Social structure , 0900 Film studies"," 0337 American history , 0700 Social structure , 0900 Film studies"," 0337 American history , 0700 Social structure , 0900 Film studies",," 0337 American history , 0700 Social structure , 0900 Film studies"," American history , Social structure , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Cinema , Modernization , Motion pictures , Segregation , Southern , US South",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fade+in%2C+crossroads%3A+The++*southern+cinema%2C+1890%E2%80%931940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jackson%2C+Robert+Andrew&amp;isbn=9781109223422&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""National bodies/embodied nations: Reading disability in Chicana/o, Mexican and Spanish cultural production","This dissertation examines the intersection of disability with race and gender in texts that seek to reconfigure or critique nationalism.

In contrast, this project asks what happens when cultural workers aligning themselves with liberatory social movements (such as feminism, the Chicana/o Movement, or struggles against globalization and in favor of democratization) reexamine nationalism and citizenship through representations of disability. It argues that although the reformulated nationalisms and transnational subjectivities presented in these texts do not always evade the problems associated with the idea of the nation—notably, its exclusionary constructions of citizenship—there are nonetheless important ethical, epistemological and political implications in the acts of claiming disability and of producing cultural texts that seek to construct communities based on that claim.",304469031,,Dissertations & Theses," Minich, Julie AvrilMinichAvrilJulieMinich, Julie Avril",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1612877141 , 41356061 , 66569 , 9780549847915 , 3332887 , 3332887", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549847915, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304469031?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0298 Modern literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0591 American literature , 0737 Hispanic American studies , 0900 Film studies"," Modern literature , Latin American literature , Romance literature , American literature , Hispanic American studies , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Chicana/o , Chicana/o literature , Chicana/o studies , Cultural production , Disability , Mexican cinema , Mexico , Nation , Reading disability , Spain , Spanish cinema",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=National+bodies%2Fembodied+nations%3A+Reading+disability+in+Chicana%2Fo%2C+Mexican+and+Spanish+cultural+production&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Minich%2C+Julie+Avril&amp;isbn=9780549847915&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Inuktitut online in Nunavik: Mixed -methods Web -based strategies for preserving Aboriginal and minority languages,"The Canadian Arctic, long considered an isolated frontier, has become an area of contention and amplified media attention. The recent unblocking of the Northwest Passage shipping routes for the first time in human memory has created a global movement toward appropriation of the Arctic. In order to ensure the environmental health and sustainable economic profitability of this environment while avoiding its destruction through misuse, it is essential that the knowledge of those who know it best, the Inuit, be communicated in the strongest manner possible. Nevertheless, the opinions and voices of the Inuit are too-often overlooked when International policy creation is considered. During this tumultuous period when the voices of the Inuit need to be stronger, more focused, and more united than ever before, the traditional language and culture is eroding in response to foreign language media influx into the area. During the 5 years preceding this research, the Internet has arrived in the Canadian North and the Inuit of Nunavik are actively participating in social networking, linking the communities together more closely than previously possible. Many of these online communities, however, are designed in English and optimized for English users. Inuktitut online is additionally fragmented through disconnects in fonts, software optimization, and hardware design. This research focuses on technological means for the creation of networks and tools designed to encourage Inuktitut use, preserve traditional knowledge, and more strongly connect a new generation of Inuit for the purpose of resistance to global pressures for unsustainable appropriation of the land and resources. Based on a Mixed-Method Case Study design, this research incorporates a survey given while living in the community of lnukjuaq, Nunavik, in addition to Content Analysis, direct observation, and interviews. Research questions focus on the use of social networking in the Arctic, language use online, and the potentiality for increased use of Inuktitut on the Internet. Data was analyzed using SPSS and atlas.ti software and triangulates results for validity and reliability. Results demonstrate the extent of problems and hindrances regarding Inuktitut online and the research proposes nine policy recommendations.",304474446,,Dissertations & Theses," Pasch, Timothy JamesPaschJamesTimothyPasch, Timothy James",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1674453291 , 40348391 , 66569 , 9781109001617 , 3345576 , 3345576", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109001617, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304474446?accountid=14496," 0385 Canadian studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0723 Information science"," 0385 Canadian studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0723 Information science"," 0385 Canadian studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0723 Information science",," 0385 Canadian studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0723 Information science"," Canadian studies , Mass communications , Information science , World Wide Web , Distance learning , Native peoples , Language acquisition"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Aboriginal , Avataq , Bebo Webtools , Endangered language preservation online , Internet in the Canadian Arctic , Inuit , Inuit Internet policy recommendation , Inukitut , Inukjuaq , Language preservation , Minority languages , Nunasoft , Nunavik , Social networking , Tusaalanga",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Inuktitut+online+in+Nunavik%3A+Mixed+-methods+Web+-based+strategies+for+preserving+Aboriginal+and+minority+languages&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pasch%2C+Timothy+James&amp;isbn=9781109001617&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A “broad-based and angry network”: Opposing surveillance and security measures post-9/11,"This thesis examines recent anti-surveillance interventions by organized groups both in Canada and internationally.

I also ask what strategies are used, what avenues are available for dissent, and how these may be developed. In particular, I argue that broad-based, participatory social movements are necessary components in the politics of surveillance, because they are able to challenge existing systems. Based on my research, I consider some ideas and identities that may inspire opposition against the more egregious effects of surveillance. I contend that these concepts and affinities must be grounded in people's experiences, and provide a means for self-empowerment and community self-reliance. They must also resonate with people's desires and imagination by providing alternative possibilities to work toward.

This thesis is based on an ethnographic research among Aboriginal people who stress that democracy is about personal and group experiences, emotions, values, policy change and practices that include respect, protection, promotion of diversity and universal human rights. Such democratic practices are deeply local but simultaneously transnational. As such, APTN is already transgressive in that it gives voice to Aboriginal individuals and groups that assert their sovereignty within the boundaries of Canada and labor to a new social order. The dissertation argues for the importance of anthropologists engaged in studying indigenous media to take seriously questions people in the field have about media research and how it is theorized. The aim of embracing such practices of APTN are to build an Aboriginal institution that is rooted in Aboriginal philosophy and ensures its durability as an Aboriginal institution. Second, to influence Aboriginal communities, non-Aboriginal communities, and political and economic powers with its programming. I frame the discussion of APTN within literature on indigenous media which generally argues that at the sweep of global media markets, indigenous people around the world have gained increasing access to media. Indigenous media is considered ""a new dynamic"" in social movements and may be seen as critiquing the ""democratic deficits"" of mainstream media. However, I propose that it is possible to distinguish between three types of scholarly narratives about indigenous media: the colonial, the activist, and the democratic. In relation to this narrative framework I discuss specifically some of the ways in which Aboriginal narrations are put into practice. For instance, I discuss some of the ways in which the management structure of APTN is conceived as a democratic ideal. Instead of creating a structure that is based on ideas of majority rule, APTN's Board of Directors operates on a principle that I suggest we call a minority rule. Another field of discussion is the production of programming for APTN, its scheduling and conception of its diverse audiences. I argue that it serves a democratic function as an empowering mechanism for different communities. Such formation unmasks the complexity of the question of what comprises ""Aboriginality"" and ""Aboriginal content"" in Canada. My third level of discussion is the acknowledgement of APTN of the heterogeneity of Aboriginal peoples in news and current affairs reporting practices. Such practices resonate with the ethos of ""deep democracy.""",304482946,,Dissertations & Theses," Hafsteinsson, Sigurjon BaldurHafsteinssonBaldurSigurjonHafsteinsson, Sigurjon Baldur",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1472134131 , 39055811 , 66569 , 9780549446231 , 3300354 , 3300354", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549446231, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304482946?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0708 Mass media , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0708 Mass media , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0708 Mass media , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0708 Mass media , 0740 Native Americans , 0740 Native studies"," Cultural anthropology , Mass media , Native Americans , Native studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Aboriginal , Aboriginal Peoples Television Network , Audiences , Democracy , Indigenous , Media , Television",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unmasking+deep+democracy%3A+Aboriginal+Peoples+Television+Network+%28APTN%29+and+cultural+production&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hafsteinsson%2C+Sigurjon+Baldur&amp;isbn=9780549446231&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"French national identity at the dawn of globalisation: Searching for a new cohesion,"The quest for identity is becoming one of the most politically charged issues at start of the third millennium. The transformative processes that are occurring as a result of globalization, as well as the mass population migrations that took place in the twentieth century, explain why the question of identity has become so central a political driving force to both the well-established democracies of the West and the post-colonial societies as they evolve in their quest toward modernization. In reaction to the dehumanization and alienation brought about by the post-industrial economies, new dissident and “deviant” identities are being forged. The concept of French citizenship, a universal abstraction as conceived by the Enlightenment, is being challenged by specific forces relating to gender, culture, sexual orientation but especially those tied to ethnicity religion, once considered as belonging to the past. New identities are being forged around sub-cultures associated with consumer habits and leisure time activities such as soccer and Rai music. Others seek refuge and legitimacy searching for roots in mythical pasts and imaginary ancestry, or in transnational movements and causes. Facing simultaneously the pressures of assimilation and exclusion within the society, ethnicity and religion become alternative choices to new immigrants who also become victims of the socio-economic vagaries of globalization. The struggle for the recognition of a dissident identity is a fight for power. Representative democracies gradually absorb dissident currents into their mainstream, Islam, however, represents a particular challenge as it has become an ideological opponent to the Western rationalism. The sheer number of followers and the size of its territory appear menacing to the West, making the migrants of Muslim descent doubly undesirable, both as poor neighbors and as suspected radicals. The uprisings of the marginalized suburbs are a symptom of this crisis. The 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center only amplified these fears. This study seeks to analyze the efforts undertaken by the French government since the 1990’, to ease the social integration of its divers minorities without sacrificing the norms and principles that make the singularity of the French national identity.",304483234,,Dissertations & Theses," Mesbah, RoyaMesbahRoyaMesbah, Roya",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1486385541 , 39315621 , 66569 , 9780549479284 , 3302242 , 3302242", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549479284, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304483234?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0318 Religion , 0615 Political science , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," Religion , Political science , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Cultural integration , Ethnic , France , Globalization , Immigration , Laws , Minorities , Multiculturalism , National identity , Political organization , Religious communities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=French+national+identity+at+the+dawn+of+globalisation%3A+Searching+for+a+new+cohesion&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mesbah%2C+Roya&amp;isbn=9780549479284&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Radical street theatre and the Yippie legacy: A performance history of the Youth International Party, 1967–1968","In 1967 and 1968, members of the Youth International Party, also known as Yippies, created several mass street demonstrations to protest President Lyndon Baines Johnson’s handling of the United States’ military involvement in the war in Vietnam. The Yippies were a loose network of hippies, anti-war activists, and left-wing radicals committed to cultural and political change. This dissertation investigates how the Yippies used avant-garde theories of theatre and performance in their year of demonstrating against the Johnson administration. The Yippies receive little attention in most histories of American performance, and theatre remains on the margins of political and social histories of the 1960s; therefore this dissertation places performance and political archives side by side to create a new historical narrative of the Yippies and performance. The Yippies created their own networked participatory street performance form by drawing on the political philosophy of the New Left student movement, the organizational strategies of the anti-war movement, and the countercultural values of the hippies. They modified this performance form, which they termed ""revolutionary actiontheater,"" with performance theories drawn from New York’s avant-garde art world, the concept of guerrilla theatre outlined by R. G. Davis of the San Francisco Mime Troupe, and the notion of Theater of Cruelty created by Antonin Artaud. Using performance theory and cultural history as primary methodologies, this project traces the Yippies’ adoption of revolutionary action-theater with three examples: the 1967 ""March on the Pentagon"" where future Yippie leaders performed an exorcism ritual at the Pentagon; the 1968 ""Grand Central Station Yip-In"" event that advertised for the Yippie movement; and the 1968 ""Festival of Life"" at the National Democratic Convention in Chicago where the Yippies nominated a pig as presidential candidate. The final chapter on the recent phenomenon of flash mobs argues that the Yippies’ legacy lives on in this participatory street performance form, and suggests that revolutionary action-theater can still serve as a model for political action.",304483585,,Dissertations & Theses," Shawyer, Susanne ElizabethShawyerElizabethSusanneShawyer, Susanne Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1597612851 , 38618391 , 66569 , 9780549764052 , 3324677 , 3324677", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549764052, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304483585?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0465 Theater"," 0337 American history , 0465 Theater"," 0337 American history , 0465 Theater",," 0337 American history , 0465 Theater"," American history , Theater"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , 1968 , Activism , Flash mob , Performance , Performance history , Politics , Street theatre , Yippies , Youth International Party",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Radical+street+theatre+and+the+Yippie+legacy%3A+A+performance+history+of+the+Youth+International+Party%2C+1967%E2%80%931968&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shawyer%2C+Susanne+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9780549764052&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""New girl order: Youth, gender, and generation in contemporary teen girls' media","This dissertation critically examines contemporary representations of femininity and adolescence in media produced for and produced by teenage girls from the early 1990s to the present. I argue that two major US movements, third wave feminism and neoliberalism, have intersected to define consumerism as equivalent to liberation in mass media directed toward girls; I simultaneously argue that media produced by girls themselves attempt to struggle with and resist this definition. I examine how the young women of “Generation Y,” born between 1980 and 2000, have become a key market for media industries, and why both mass and alternative media are so important to this demographic group. I critically analyze representations of young womanhood within forms of media including television, film, magazines, and websites, emphasizing texts that have been specifically introduced to represent and appeal to Generation Y. The emergence and development of third wave feminism coincided with the maturation of Generation Y. Young women who grew up in a society shaped by the achievements of the second wave of feminism have worked to participate in a new feminist movement that would critique and respond to inequalities based not only on gender (as in second wave feminism) but also on race, class and sexuality. The third wave feminist movement has focused on individual politics rather than organized, collective action. My work examines the individual bias of this movement, and how this has influenced contemporary representations of young women's empowerment in both industrially produced and alternatively produced texts. The economic movement of neoliberalism has also contributed to the corporate environment in which teens girls' media are produced. Neoliberal policies operate on the philosophy that the unimpeded operation of the free market will provide maximum economic efficiency and by extension contribute to individual freedom. I examine media products produced for young women as important sites for the negotiation of identity, produced within an increasingly global discourse of individualism. My analysis of texts and social context hopes to shed light on struggles to define the nature of young women's empowerment in this rapidly changing media environment, characterized by shifts in industry, technology, and society.",304485604,,Dissertations & Theses," Murphy, Caryn E.MurphyE.CarynMurphy, Caryn E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1601027281 , 40193641 , 66569 , 9780549803447 , 3327836 , 3327836", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549803447, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304485604?accountid=14496," 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies"," 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies"," 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies",," 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies"," Mass communications , Gender studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Gender , Girl power , Girls' culture , Girls' studies , Media , Third wave feminism , Youth media , Youth studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=New+girl+order%3A++Youth%2C+gender%2C+and+generation+in+contemporary+teen+girls%27+media&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Murphy%2C+Caryn+E.&amp;isbn=9780549803447&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Masculine dimensions: Migration and gender in francophone literature and culture,"Since the arrival on the literary scene of a number of celebrated women writers during the last thirty years gender has occupied a prominent position in Francophone Studies. Drawing upon this significant body of scholarship, this dissertation aims to show that new representations of gender and sexuality in African literature have not been limited to reinventions of femininity by women writers. I make this argument specifically through a study of the reformulations of gendered identity provoked by migratory movement and the unique migrant trajectories instigated by gender trouble. African masculinity in particular occupies a complex and dynamic position in relation to migration. While Western legislative action requires that African men conform legally to new found cultural norms, social rhetoric constructs the African migrant as a mutable, marginalized figure in Western society. I seek to understand how francophone African literature written during the last twenty years has responded to and re-imagined this binary of migration and masculinity, and to explore the implications such literary strategies have for writing, literature, migration, and identity. Setting forth a corpus composed of novels and autobiographical texts, I argue that in contrast to African writers of the 1950s and 1960s who propose a revalorization of African masculine authority and identity in the face of transnational displacement and disruption, contemporary authors embrace and intensify the problematization of masculinity that occurs through migration. In these texts the masculine body is hyper-eroticized, immigrants perform male drag, homosexuality threatens heterosexuality, and father figures become seducers. Individual chapters propose readings either of a single work or of related texts in light of specific aspects of African migrant experience – the sexual objectification of the African man; social activism and community building; the return of the emigrant; civil war and refugee flows – and their attendant issues of masculine corporeality, identity, and authority. In discussions informed by postcolonial theory, gender studies, histories of migrations, and concepts of transnationalism, I suggest that this recent literary tendency, by favoring complex, diverse portrayals of migrant masculinity over homogenous, consistent representations, offers startling new insights into Francophone identity, gendered relations, the French Republic, and transnational culture.",304491673,,Dissertations & Theses," Bryson, DevinBrysonDevinBryson, Devin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1675761431 , 42466181 , 66569 , 9781109009811 , 3345910 , 3345910", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109009811, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304491673?accountid=14496," 0316 African literature , 0733 Gender studies"," 0316 African literature , 0733 Gender studies"," 0316 African literature , 0733 Gender studies",," 0316 African literature , 0733 Gender studies"," African literature , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , African Studies , Culture , Francophone , Francophonie , French Studies , Gender , Masculinity , Migration",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Masculine+dimensions%3A+Migration+and+gender+in+francophone+literature+and+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bryson%2C+Devin&amp;isbn=9781109009811&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Quanzhou Kaiyuan Monastery: Architecture, iconography and social contexts","This dissertation examines the iconography and architecture of Kaiyuan Monastery (KYS) in Quanzhou in relation to its social context.

Through examining its five major buildings—ordination hall, two pagodas, main hall and Tanyue ci, this dissertation demonstrates that the evolution of the iconography and architecture has been linked to Buddhist doctrines, political situations and social development. The ordination hall, for example, was rebuilt in order to follow Daoxuan's plan. Quanzhou, as an international seaport in the Song and Yuan, its multi-cultures and multi-religions are reflected on the iconography and architecture of KYS. The Brahmanical elements found in KYS and elsewhere in Quanzhou indicate a multicultural fusion in society. Nevertheless, the structure of the two stone pagodas and other Song buildings in Fujian, similar to the chu-shim-po-jak style in Korea and the Daibutsuyō in Japan, suggests the intimate relationships between these countries. The ban of maritime trade resulted in the decline of Quanzhou and Kaiyuan Monastery; on the other hand, a rebuilding of Tanyue ci contributed to the lineage formation of the Huang family along the trend of lineage movement in China during the Ming and Qing periods.",304504570,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, Chen-shanWangChen-shanWang, Chen-shan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1537005891 , 40099991 , 66569 , 9780549574903 , 3309521 , 3309521", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549574903, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304504570?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0332 History , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0332 History , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture",," 0332 History , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," History , Art history , Architecture"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Architectural history , Architecture , Brahmanical temple , Buddhist , Buddhist architecture , China , Chinese architecture , Iconography , Kaiyuan Monastery , Quanzhou",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Quanzhou+Kaiyuan+Monastery%3A+Architecture%2C+iconography+and+social+contexts&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Chen-shan&amp;isbn=9780549574903&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The work of Max Cetto: Restorations of topography and disciplinarity in twentieth century modern architecture,"This dissertation examines the work of architect Max Cetto. Educated and trained in the progressive circles of Weimar Germany during the 1920's, Cetto witnessed and participated in the rise of modern architecture during its “heroic” decade. Beginning in 1936 he worked for the National Socialists in one of the remaining enclaves of modernism in the country. At the eve of the war and frustrated by the socio-political climate of Germany, he decided to immigrate to America. After a brief but crucial stop in the United States, he settled in Mexico in 1939, where he remained for the rest of his life. Having the privilege of learning, debating, and working with important architectural figures, Cetto arrived to Mexico with a solid career behind him. Yet it was in his adoptive country where he produced his most influential work. Apart from many significant buildings he contributed to transform Mexican architectural culture, which by the time of his arrival was enthusiastically committed to responding pressing social demands but was also highly formalistic in prospects, methods and results. Paradoxically as an alien, his specific contribution consisted of a place-oriented hermeneutics that challenged the instrumental and aesthetically-oriented one of local architects. In the wider context, his work belonged to a comprehensive realignment of the international modern movement meant to overcome its inaugural stage and achieve effective consonances between buildings and their physical and cultural milieus. Cetto's topographical approach introduced and revived ways to thematize topics of site, materiality, spatiality and practicality. More peculiarly, he helped to redirect the efforts of Mexico's relatively autonomous but isolated modernism within a proper disciplinary perspective. This dissertation takes issue with the view that sees his work as the imposition of an “international style” in an independent national/modern horizon. It also challenges the argument considering him a sublimator of the “tension” between modernity and tradition. While it partially acknowledges these claims, it sees problems of diffusion, intrusion or synthesis as marginal. More narrowly but of greater architectural relevance, it considers his education and professional upbringing, namely the influence of Hans Poelzig, and his role as a young practitioner, as determinant for his mature work. Without disavowing the influence that Mexico exerted upon him, it regards his formative background as the basis for his transformative role as both advocate of architecture's disciplinary identity and its compliance with the structures of the natural world.",304505864,,Dissertations & Theses," Heredia, Juan ManuelHerediaManuelJuanHeredia, Juan Manuel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1602101451 , 40101351 , 66569 , 9780549809784 , 3328576 , 3328576", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549809784, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304505864?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0729 Architecture"," 0304 Biographies , 0729 Architecture"," 0304 Biographies , 0729 Architecture",," 0304 Biographies , 0729 Architecture"," Biographies , Architecture"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Barragan, Luis , Cetto, Max , German architecture , Germany , Mexican architecture , Mexico , Poelzig, Hans , Twentieth century , Twentieth century architecture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+work+of+Max+Cetto%3A+Restorations+of+topography+and+disciplinarity+in+twentieth+century+modern+architecture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heredia%2C+Juan+Manuel&amp;isbn=9780549809784&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Client nurse interactions with schizophrenic clients: A descriptive study,"Social dysfunction is one of the hallmark characteristics of chronic schizophrenia. Social cognition has been identified as having a role in this feature of the disorder. Recent literature and research has focused on facial and vocal affect recognition and social cue perception. Each of these functions influences an individual's ability to respond in a social situation. Despite the growing body of research, little is known about the actual interaction of providers with these clients. This qualitative descriptive research study focused on the interactions of a clinical nurse specialist (CNS) with three clients with schizophrenia in an urban community mental health center. Three sessions per client were videotaped during medication monitoring sessions. The CNS was interviewed post client contact. The videotapes were analyzed in five steps, beginning with a global analysis of the overall the interaction followed by a microanalysis of the nonverbal communication of the CNS and each client. The third step analyzed nonverbal with the verbal communication. Congruency between the CNS's nonverbal behaviors and client responses was then examined. In the final step, the three videotapes for each client were analyzed for similarities and differences along with a cross case analysis. Data collected from the interviews with the CNS were analyzed for similarities and differences in interactional style across cases. Several patterns emerged. The interactional style of the CNS conveyed commitment and empathy. She appeared to join with her clients despite their persistent psychotic symptoms and used humor with two of the clients. All three clients responded to her with both verbal and nonverbal communication. The clients showed difficulty with direct eye contact that made reciprocal movement and interchange difficult. Even when making eye contact, clients did not respond until the CNS used exaggerated facial and vocal cues. This finding is consistent with the literature on social cognition describing the difficulty that this population has with facial affect recognition. This study begins the documentation of verbal and nonverbal communication that could be considered in helping clients learn how to enhance interaction with others outside the clinical setting.",304507124,,Dissertations & Theses," Pounds, Karen VincentPoundsVincentKarenPounds, Karen Vincent",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1544921591 , 40200571 , 66569 , 9780549633808 , 3314447 , 3314447", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549633808, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304507124?accountid=14496," 0347 Mental health , 0569 Nursing"," 0347 Mental health , 0569 Nursing"," 0347 Mental health , 0569 Nursing",," 0347 Mental health , 0569 Nursing"," Mental health , Nursing , Schizophrenia , Client relationships"," Health and environmental sciences , Client-nurse interaction , Schizophrenia , Therapeutic relationship , Videotaping",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Client+nurse+interactions+with+schizophrenic+clients%3A+A+descriptive+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pounds%2C+Karen+Vincent&amp;isbn=9780549633808&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Black internationalism and African and Caribbean intellectuals in London, 1919–1950","During the three decades between the end of World War I and 1950, African and West Indian scholars, professionals, university students, artists, and political activists in London forged new conceptions of community, reshaped public debates about the nature and goals of British colonialism, and prepared the way for a revolutionary and self-consciously modern African culture. Black intellectuals formed organizations that became homes away from home and centers of cultural mixture and intellectual debate, and launched publications that served as new means of voicing social commentary and political dissent. These black associations developed within an atmosphere characterized by a variety of internationalisms, including pan-ethnic movements, feminism, communism, and the socialist internationalism ascendant within the British Left after World War I. The intellectual and political context of London and the types of sociability that these groups fostered gave rise to a range of black internationalist activity and new regional imaginaries in the form of a West Indian Federation and a United West Africa that shaped the goals of anticolonialism before 1950. This dissertation examines the black organizations and other social spaces that brought people of African descent together in London to illustrate how the city functioned, at once, as imperial metropolis and global city, as the administrative center of the British Empire and the nexus of black resistance to racism and imperialism.",304510895,,Dissertations & Theses," Matera, MarcMateraMarcMatera, Marc",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1612976421 , 41357961 , 66569 , 9780549876137 , 3330906 , 3330906", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549876137, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304510895?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0733 Gender studies",," 0328 Black history , 0335 European history , 0733 Gender studies"," Black history , European history , Gender studies"," Social sciences , African , African history , Black internationalism , Black/African women , British history , Caribbean , Caribbean history , England , Intellectuals , London , Pan-Africanism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Black+internationalism+and+African+and+Caribbean+intellectuals+in+London%2C+1919%E2%80%931950&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Matera%2C+Marc&amp;isbn=9780549876137&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Refugee utopias: (Re)theorizing refugeeism through cultural production of the Hmong diaspora,"This dissertation theorizes the existence of “refugee utopias”—fraught liminal spaces of refugee resettlement wherein culture is produced and reproduced in moments of transition, suspension, and progression that put communities into diaspora. Engaging audio and visual magnetic media, orthographies and literacy practices, and literary movements and texts, this study offers one broad, diverse composite of Hmong diasporic cultural practices.

This analysis offers active and engaged frameworks for the contemplation of the contemporary moment of cultural production throughout the Hmong diaspora. Throughout this study, the cultural figure of the refugee is (re)considered, and its stigmas of perpetual victimhood and the necessity of patronage are stripped away. In their place, the cultural agency of the refugee is restored and refugeeism is retheorized—expanded and enlarged—facilitating responsible and apt engagement of the cultural contributions and cultural creations of those global actors who are often relegated as props in the dramas of war, calamity, and human migration.",304512988,,Dissertations & Theses," Ogden, Mitchell PaulOgdenPaulMitchellOgden, Mitchell Paul",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1594487731 , 40125381 , 66569 , 9780549751571 , 3323546 , 3323546", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549751571, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304512988?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology",," 0591 American literature , 0631 Minority & ethnic groups , 0631 Sociology"," American literature , Minority & ethnic groups , Sociology"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Cultural production , Diaspora , Hmong , Literacy , Refugee , Utopia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Refugee+utopias%3A+%28Re%29theorizing+refugeeism+through+cultural+production+of+the+Hmong+diaspora&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ogden%2C+Mitchell+Paul&amp;isbn=9780549751571&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Revolution and utopia: &lt;i&gt;Estridentismo&lt;/i&gt; and the visual arts, 1921–1927","Estridentismo, founded by the poet and law student Manuel Maples Arce, was the first Mexican cultural movement to align itself consciously with the strategies of the historical avant-gardes. An examination of estridentismo reveals conflicting political and social agendas among the post-Revolutionary intelligentsia and the diversity of artistic production in Mexico during the 1920s. Through a close reading of high art, contemporary cultural criticism, and popular culture, this dissertation locates estridentismo in relation to both the international artistic and literary avant-gardes and a broader program of national modernity. Chapter One focuses on estridentismo's origins and initial debt to Italian Futurism and Spanish Ultraísmo . By co-opting foreign avant-garde models, Maples Arce aimed to transform the parochialism of Mexican art and literature and to update the model of the socially-engaged intellectual. The estridentistas' construction of a vanguard identity through portraiture is the central theme of Chapter Two. Here I demonstrate that Maples Arce's strategic solicitation of portraits from supporters heightened and expanded the movement's profile, creating visual ties to Mexico's vanguard artists. Chapter Three explores estridentismo 's fundamental aim to forge a progressive, post-Revolutionary consciousness through its journal Irradiador and its varied imagery, including woodcuts, watercolors, photographs, and masks. I suggest that by embracing technology and advanced art, the estridentistas countered the state-promoted fiction of an authentic and timeless indigenous rural culture. Chapter Four addresses official commissions for murals received by estridentista artists and their contemporaries. Their varied approaches reflect competing nationalist and cultural ideologies circulating in Mexico during the early-to mid-1920s. My analysis reveals that doubts concerning the suitability of modernist visual styles to depict a stable national body prompted a crisis within estridentismo. Chapter Five scrutinizes the movement's final phase in Jalapa, contending that its production there should be considered apart from the earlier period. In contrast with its initial aggressively anti-establishment position, estridentismo now benefited from state sponsorship. This paradoxical institutional support allowed the estridentistas to further their belief in the redemptive power of culture for post-Revolutionary Mexico while recasting the movement as a vanguard utopian project.",304534008,,Dissertations & Theses," Klich, LyndaKlichLyndaKlich, Lynda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1538821831 , 40132741 , 66569 , 9780549621287 , 3312917 , 3312917", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549621287, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304534008?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Avant-garde , Estridentismo , Mexican art , Mexico , Modernity , Muralism , Portraiture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Revolution+and+utopia%3A+Estridentismo%0Aand+the+visual+arts%2C+1921%E2%80%931927&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Klich%2C+Lynda&amp;isbn=9780549621287&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Understanding policymakers' perspectives: A critical factor in promoting reproductive health development progress in Ukraine,"The international donor community, predominately the U.S. Government, has invested over $24 million in reproductive health programs in Ukraine, expressly to decrease abortion rates and increase the use of modern contraceptives. Yet, as of 2006, after over 12 years of reproductive health development programming, Ukraine still had one of the highest levels of abortion in the world and the use of modern contraceptives remained very low. In addition, broader international donor goals of building sustainable development programs had not been realized due to Ukrainian policymakers' indifference towards donor supported programs, demonstrated by their lack of financial support for reproductive health development initiatives in Ukraine. This investigation reveals one significant reason that Ukrainian policymakers have essentially rejected reproductive health development programs over the past decade: distinct differences between international donors' and Ukrainian policymakers' social constructions and cultural meanings of reproductive health. From 2005-2006 this qualitative study surveyed 42 Ukrainian policymakers and interviewed an additional 42, comparing their feedback to 20 international donor participants working on reproductive health policy and programs in Ukraine. The research methodology was guided by the Policy Circle, the Health Belief Model, and the Theory of Planned Behavior, as well as political-economic and socio-cultural paradigms. Study feedback revealed distinct differences in definitions for reproductive health, cultural meanings of health services, and perceptions of gender. The data also revealed some agreement on perspectives of current reproductive health policy and issues in development. Also, research into donor attitudes challenges prevailing scholarly presuppositions that development is a homogenous movement. This research suggests that both donor respondents and Ukrainian policymaker participants define reproductive health in fundamentally different ways. Essentially their reproductive health values and priorities are not closely aligned. Ukrainian policymakers are concerned with major demographic declines and they situate a woman's role as ""mother first"" of primary importance in Ukrainian society. These priorities appear to be in conflict with donors' goals of increasing modern contraception use in Ukraine. Unlike international donors, Ukrainian policymakers did not conceptualize of abortion within a moral framework; rather, their conceptions of reproductive health were embedded in the political-economic situation at the time.",304567545,,Dissertations & Theses," Waller, Kimberly AnnWallerAnnKimberlyWaller, Kimberly Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1663052421 , 41155841 , 66569 , 9780549915195 , 3336933 , 3336933", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549915195, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304567545?accountid=14496," 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science"," 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science"," 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science",," 0573 Public health , 0615 Political science"," Public health , Political science"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Development , Gender , Policymaking , Population decline , Reproductive health , Ukraine",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Understanding+policymakers%27+perspectives%3A+A+critical+factor+in+promoting+reproductive+health+development+progress+in+Ukraine&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Waller%2C+Kimberly+Ann&amp;isbn=9780549915195&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Micropolitics of transition in Yugoslavia: A local and a global demise,"The thesis provides a cultural analysis on the micropolitics of Yugoslavia wars in 1992-1995, examining local and global media coverage along with grassroots and historical dimensions.

The ethnographic focus is on two groups. One of these is Memoria Activa, which developed following the 1994 bombing of an important local institution, the Argentine Jewish Mutual Aid Society (AMIA). Their demands center on the need for a serious investigation and justice in the attack, which remains unresolved. The other group I discuss is the Cooperativa BAUEN. Part of a broader phenomenon know as the recuperated businesses movement, this workers' cooperative was formed by a set of former employees from a central Buenos Aires hotel after its closure in 2001. The cooperative, which took control of the installation and reopened its operations under their own direction, remains engaged in a prolonged struggle with opposing economic and political forces over the legitimacy and effects of their actions. In looking at these groups, I consider the ways that notions of impunity and corruption permeate and structure their demands. I illustrate how these notions have developed out of a particular cultural and historical context, and have come to serve as a source of conceptual unity among and across a number of groups working for social change. I also consider the practical and strategic constraints they face in engaging with national and international legal and political systems. In doing so, I show how differing assessments of appropriate forms of engagement with established institutions and centers of power tend to serve as a source of division for groups with highly similar aims. Ultimately, this dissertation demonstrates how these groups, through asserting and working to achieve their demands, at once conform to and challenge codified forms of institutional practice. They engage with a labyrinthine system of public administration in what is fundamentally a mutually transformative process of continual generation that defines and redefines the limits and boundaries of political action.",304572170,,Dissertations & Theses," Faulk, Karen AnnFaulkAnnKarenFaulk, Karen Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1604929961 , 39544451 , 66569 , 9780549814917 , 3328817 , 3328817", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549814917, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304572170?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Argentina , Citizenship , Corruption , Impunity , Jewish communities , Labor",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+walls+of+the+labyrinth%3A+Impunity%2C+corruption%2C+and+the+limits+of+politics+in+contemporary+Argentina&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Faulk%2C+Karen+Ann&amp;isbn=9780549814917&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Lutheran in two worlds: Remaking mission from Madagascar to the Midwest United States,"This dissertation is an historical ethnography of moral personhood and practices of moral and political collectivity among former American Lutheran missionaries to Madagascar, their American supporters, and their social relations in Madagascar. Through examining post-colonial Lutheranism in the Midwest United States and Southern Madagascar, it develops an analysis of the everyday construction of religion as a dynamic and debated material-semiotic process. The dissertation stems from twenty-two months of ethnographic fieldwork and archival research in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota and in travel to Southern Madagascar. American Lutheran involvement in the southern region of Madagascar began in 1888 with the establishment of a mission church and continued through the late twentieth century. Although the American Lutheran mission (ALC/ELCA) has largely dissolved in the past twenty years, the movement endures through family relationships, practices of remembrance, and material exchanges in two international aid organizations. For missionaries and their families now living in Minnesota, Madagascar has become a sacred site in an interwoven moral geography that includes Norway and the Midwest U.S. Moreover, the connection to Madagascar reinforces other dimensions of social identity, such as Norwegian ethnicity. Through family keepsakes and memoirs, missionary involvement on the island is remembered as a Norwegian-American endeavor that stems from the Norwegian Mission Society's establishment of a mission in 1866. In exploring how the legacy of colonialism compelled a reassessment of worldly engagement, I show that retired missionaries use practices of kinship to place religion and social identity outside the institutional boundaries of the ALC/ELCA. My research found that American Lutherans and Malagasy Lutherans are engaged in a related process of socializing biblical models of personal relationships, such as that of “accompaniment” from Luke 24, into new religious institutions. Two recently established medical aid organizations in Minneapolis provide biomedical relief to Madagascar and other former sites of American Lutheran evangelism. The medical relief organizations usher in a new situation whereby things rather than people become the primary cultural and religious intermediaries, producing as one result the reconstitution of the medical supplies as person-like, speaking forms through which to know the world beyond.",304576705,,Dissertations & Theses," Halvorson, Britt E.HalvorsonE.BrittHalvorson, Britt E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1663895671 , 39544451 , 66569 , 9780549985082 , 3343081 , 3343081", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549985082, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304576705?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Religion , Cultural anthropology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Christianity , Lutheran , Madagascar , Materiality , Midwest , Missions , Personhood , Religion",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Lutheran+in+two+worlds%3A+Remaking+mission+from+Madagascar+to+the+Midwest+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Halvorson%2C+Britt+E.&amp;isbn=9780549985082&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Subversive genes: Re(con)stituting identity, family and human rights in Argentina","This ethnographic dissertation examines DNA identification technologies and their relationship to political, social and familial reconstitution in post-dictatorship Argentina. In the wake of the widespread terror of the 1976-1983 dictatorship, Argentine mothers and grandmothers had the dubious honor of being the first group worldwide to organize around genetic technologies as tools for human rights. This dissertation focuses on these women, who now make up two major human rights groups: one organized around the recovery of their kidnapped grandchildren and the other organized around the identification of the bodies of the 30,000 disappeared. Drawing on rich personal narratives and interviews with scientists and family members affected by violence, I argue that DNA is a particularly powerful human rights technology because it is able to simultaneously work at various levels of social life. I thus focus on three interconnected social spaces—the interpersonal, the familial, and the national—tracing the mutability and movement of DNA quite literally from bodies, to labs, to courtrooms, to international halls of power. By examining the day-to-day reality of human rights advocacy, I document the ways in which DNA technologies figure in that project both discursively, as a powerful metaphor for family and disordered national identity, and practically, as a tool for criminal prosecution and the restitution of identity of both the living and the dead. My research suggests that forensic DNA identification technologies have emerged as core sites of identity formation for individuals and families affected by the terror of the dictatorship as well as for the Argentine nation-state as it tries to reckon with the legacies of repression. This dissertation contributes to broader questions in the social sciences and humanities chronicling, on a theoretical level, the dialectical relationship between violence, social meaning-making, and scientific process and, on an ethnographic level, how people in the midst of terribly difficult situations make complex ethical decisions about the application and meaning of new technologies. Moreover in focusing on the coproduction of political and scientific orders, this research contributes new perspectives on traditional post-conflict questions about justice, and meaning making and offers an important account of the increasingly central role of science in human rights work.",304598025,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith, Lindsay AdamsSmithAdamsLindsaySmith, Lindsay Adams",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1617312371 , 41409891 , 66569 , 9780549882305 , 3334796 , 3334796", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549882305, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304598025?accountid=14496," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0585 Science history , 0616 International law"," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0585 Science history , 0616 International law"," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0585 Science history , 0616 International law",," 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0585 Science history , 0616 International law"," Forensic anthropology , Science history , International law"," Social sciences , Argentina , Disappearance , Family , Forced disappearance , Forensic DNA , Human rights , Identity , Transitional justice , Trauma",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Subversive+genes%3A+Re%28con%29stituting+identity%2C+family+and+human+rights+in+Argentina&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+Lindsay+Adams&amp;isbn=9780549882305&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Biotech pilgrims and medical entrepreneurs: Cultural encounters from cyberspace to China,"""Biotech Pilgrims and Medical Entrepreneurs"" follows the efforts of Chinese doctors and their foreign patients to cure what conventional medicine has deemed incurable. Based on 24 months of multi-sited fieldwork at high-tech medical centers in urban China, I argue that the conjunction of market-driven reforms and Internet-based communication technologies has reconfigured the quest for experimental therapies on a global scale. I develop the concept of biotech pilgrimage to explore how faith intertwines with technology and travel as patients and doctors push the boundaries of conventional medical treatment in pursuit of a therapeutic miracle. My ethnographic study highlights the crucial role of the Internet in mediating these new transnational health-seeking practices, exploring how online discussion forums have fostered a new social movement of patients, families, researchers, and doctors who cross national borders to pursue experimental therapies. My dissertation also analyzes how changes in the political economy of health care have encouraged Chinese doctors to experiment with lucrative biomedical interventions for foreign patients, transforming China's urban medical system into a laboratory for entrepreneurial tactics that blur the boundaries between public and private, legal and illegal, ethical and unethical. The pursuit of high-tech therapies by medical entrepreneurs is not just about making money, but also about professional ambitions and national salvation—a cultural phenomenon I frame as technonationalism. ""Biotech Pilgrims and Medical Entrepreneurs"" synthesizes key concerns in medical anthropology, ethnographic approaches to globalization, and the anthropology of Chinese culture and society. I examine the specific ways in which cultural values, economic pressures, and geopolitical histories engage experimental medicine on the level of lived experience. By foregrounding what is at stake for Chinese doctors and their patients from around the world, I explore how both groups deploy hope in ""cutting-edge"" medicine as a survival tactic to transcend the danger and uncertainty threatening their lives and their futures.",304603149,,Dissertations & Theses," Song, Priscilla PosuanSongPosuanPriscillaSong, Priscilla Posuan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1534029251 , 40022741 , 66569 , 9780549617235 , 3312527 , 3312527", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549617235, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304603149?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0339 Forensic anthropology , 0573 Public health"," Cultural anthropology , Forensic anthropology , Public health"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Bioethics , Biomedicine , China , Globalization , Health inequality , Internet",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Biotech+pilgrims+and+medical+entrepreneurs%3A+Cultural+encounters+from+cyberspace+to+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Song%2C+Priscilla+Posuan&amp;isbn=9780549617235&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The acoustics of identity: Linguistic passports beyond empire and essentialism,"This dissertation is an historically contextualized set of auto/ethnographic case studies and critical analyses of the discursive productions of race, ethnicity, class, and the nation-state. Based on the life histories of culturally and linguistically diverse individuals living in the United States and Mexico between the 19 th and 21 st centuries, this research deconstructs binary discourses that police human subjectivity, identity, and conduct according to the laws of the state and cultural norms of a stratified and racialized society. Microanalyses of the articulations of everyday speech are used to track the movements and migrations of people across borders and boundaries of all kinds, yielding rich evidence of the legacies and presences of macro-level processes of colonization and globalization. The project establishes new ground in the field of cultural studies by offering a nuanced understanding of spoken language that extends our capacity to theorize identity. It does so by bringing linguistic—rather than, typically, literary—forms of analysis to bear on language as a cultural practice. In examining the under-studied “soundscape” of speech, this dissertation brings existing theoretical frameworks from the fields of cultural studies, sociolinguistics, intercultural/international communication, and critical whiteness studies into new configurations and conversation to produce a theory of “acoustic identity.” The term serves as a metaphor to capture a set of auditory and visual performance practices, which crosscut relations of power and disrupt hegemonic epistemes of race/ethnicity, social class, language, culture, and the nation. As a theoretical lens, it addresses dialectical tensions among modernist/postmodernist, essentialist/anti-essentialist, local/global, and micro/macro approaches to analyzing the intersection of language, identity, and power (agency). This research was conducted using a distinctive multi-sited ethnographic method, which historically contextualizes the autoethnographic narratives, ethnographic interviews, and critical analyses of discourse presented in each case study. Ethnographic “thick descriptions” are infused with broad historical overviews of people, places, and events relevant to the case studies, which include monolingual, bilingual, and bidialectal speakers of standard and non-standard varieties of American English, Mexican Spanish, and Navajo. By linking the particulars of each case to a larger set of sociocultural and political-economic forces, this method makes the historical trajectory of certain discourses more transparent and provides a logic with which to understand how legacies of the past—both empowering and debilitating ones—are able to go on living. The effort to produce an integrated archaeology of discourses and narratives of lived experience sets this method apart from other multi-sited ethnographic projects. On the basis of evidence from the case studies, the author argues: (1) Standard American English (SAE) is not neutral, but rather clearly associated with a professional, educated, “white,” US-American, middle class experience; (2) Even more so than grammatical knowledge, the mastery of an accent (phonological repertoire) suggests lived experience, or “native speaker” status, which in turn suggests the “authenticity” of a speaker's identity; (3) Codeswitching can be understood as both a sociocultural credential and liability; and (4) “White/whiteness”—as a social identity—is not monolithic and does not necessarily refer to skin color. It also operates as a metaphor indexing privilege within a complex set of possibilities. A theory of acoustic identity informs contemporary debates and discussions over public and cultural policy in sectors that include education, government, and industry.",304606848,,Dissertations & Theses," Filmer, Alice AshtonFilmerAshtonAliceFilmer, Alice Ashton",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1630717191 , 41654071 , 66569 , 9780549909040 , 3337774 , 3337774", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549909040, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304606848?accountid=14496," 0279 Language arts , 0459 Communication , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0279 Language arts , 0459 Communication , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0279 Language arts , 0459 Communication , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0279 Language arts , 0459 Communication , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Language arts , Communication , Ethnic studies , Acoustics , Social identity , Linguistics , Case studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Education , Codeswitching , Ethnography , Identity , Intercultural communication , Linguistic diversity , Whiteness studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+acoustics+of+identity%3A+Linguistic+passports+beyond+empire+and+essentialism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Filmer%2C+Alice+Ashton&amp;isbn=9780549909040&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Ethnic NewsWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Corporate social and environmental disclosure in emerging securities markets: China as a case study,"Corporate social and environmental disclosure (CSE disclosure) has been increasing greatly in developed markets since 1990s. Accordingly, most of the relevant literature focuses on the development of CSE disclosure in developed markets; little attention has been paid to emerging markets. CSE disclosure in fact may have important implications for constructing healthy emerging markets. International organizations and some emerging markets recently have launched initiatives to promote CSE disclosure. But CSE disclosure is not a measure that can be adopted by a securities market without considering the legal, social and economic underpinnings. CSE disclosure involves a wide range of questions, including how the people and the government in a given society think of corporate social responsibility (CSR); what mechanisms are available in a given society to shape the CSR movement; how the corporate governance structure in a given society deals with the relationships among its constituents (shareholders and other stakeholders); how the socially responsible investing in a given market develops; whether the legal system is capable to enforce law; and so on. The feasibility of a CSE disclosure approach in an emerging market depends on the institutional environments of the market. Considered the institutional differences between developed markets and emerging markets and as well between emerging markets themselves, this article gives an overview of the CSE disclosure development in emerging markets, and particularly takes China as a case study to tangibly examine the institutional factors.",304607137,,Dissertations & Theses," Lin, Li WenLinWenLiLin, Li Wen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1630751861 , 40213501 , 66569 , 9780549909699 , 3337847 , 3337847", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549909699, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304607137?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0454 Management"," 0398 Law , 0454 Management"," 0398 Law , 0454 Management",," 0398 Law , 0454 Management"," Law , Management"," Social sciences , China , Corporate governance , Corporate social responsibility , Disclosure , Environmental disclosure , Securities markets",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Corporate+social+and+environmental+disclosure+in+emerging+securities+markets%3A++China+as+a+case+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lin%2C+Li+Wen&amp;isbn=9780549909699&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Urban magic: The Art Ensemble of Chicago's great Black music,"This dissertation is an analytical and interpretive study of the Art Ensemble of Chicago's distinctive multi-disciplinary performance practice.

The first chapter surveys the home-base of the missionaries from the four different nationalities and suggests that the common theological orientation of the missionaries was orthodox Presbyterianism and Evangelicalism. Some other formative factors from the home-bases were the emphases on education, commerce or development, social responsibility, and the sense of duty in the spread of “civilization.” Those features, in general, shaped the “superiority” of both Christianity and Western civilization in the mind and practice of the Presbyterian missionaries. The second chapter shows that the missionaries pursued unity within the Presbyterian tradition, cooperation and comity along with the churches in other traditions and the missionary societies, and the development of an indigenous Presbytery or Church both in Manchuria and the rest of China. The missionaries, however, also maintained their narrow-mindedness in unity, a reluctance in divesting themselves of the responsibilities for the Church of Manchuria, and a hostile attitude toward the Roman Catholic Church. In encountering Chinese religions, they generally held the position that the Chinese religions were “pagan” or “superstitious” and that Christianity was superior to them. However, a few missionaries tried to understand those religions from an historical point of view and affirm some aspects of their spirituality. They thereby hoped to see the emergence of a Chinese Christianity with Chinese religious and cultural characteristics. The third chapter investigates the ways in which the missionaries worked among immigrants, refugees and the sick. The period that the missionaries worked in Southern Manchuria was also a time in which massive migrations from North China, Korea, and Japan to Manchuria were made. It was also a time when China, Russia, and Japan were competing with one another for the dominance in East Asia. This resulted in a couple of international wars mainly in Southern Manchuria. The missionaries were faced with a considerable number of immigrants and refugees as a result of the wars. The desperate needs of the people in Southern Manchuria helped the missionaries change their mission methods and dedicate themselves to relief, development, and some other types of activities to improve the conditions of the people's life. Whereas the other three nationalities dealt mainly with the marginalized, the American missionaries who worked among the Japanese in the Kwantung Leased Territory in Manchuria had a different context in encountering the (semi)-colonizers. The last chapter analyzes the missionaries' political and ‘politically neutral’ stances made in response to national events. Experiencing the Boxer Uprising of 1900 and the May Thirtieth Incident of 1925, the British missionaries came to be sympathetic to Chinese nationalism and expressed their willingness to abandon the political rights of Christian missions coming out of the unequal treaties. Korean missionaries joined the anti-colonial movement in Manchuria as contributing to nationalistic education. In addition, facing the crisis of the Korean immigrants' survival in the midst of the competing Chinese and Japanese nationalisms in Manchuria, some Korean missionaries participated in the naturalization movement for Chinese citizenship. Some American missionaries saw the bilingual and bicultural ability in many Koreans residing in Manchuria. They hoped to mobilize them for the evangelization of the Chinese. The American missionaries among the Japanese in Manchuria had the attitude of ‘political neutrality.’ However, they were, especially in the early period of their work, considerably dependent on the financial support of the Japanese Kwantung Government. In the conclusion, the author suggests that the direction for the future study of Christianity in Manchuria should be indigenization and contextualization of the Church. He also suggests the direction for trans-nationality in encouraging the study of Christianity among the minority ethnic groups in Manchuria and the study of the transnational expressions between and among the different groups.",304625138,,Dissertations & Theses," Park, Hyung ShinParkShinHyungPark, Hyung Shin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1617383961 , 41432721 , 66569 , 9780549887133 , 3335279 , 3335279", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549887133, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304625138?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0332 History"," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0332 History"," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0332 History",," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0332 History"," Religious history , History"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , China , Evangelicalism , Indigenization , Manchuria , Missions , Presbyterian , Presbyterianism , Trans-nationality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Presbyterian+missionaries+in+Southern+Manchuria%2C+1867%E2%80%931931%3A+Religion%2C+society%2C+and+politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Park%2C+Hyung+Shin&amp;isbn=9780549887133&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Of lands, regions and zones: The poetics and politics of non-urban spaces in the 1960s in Brazil and Argentina","This dissertation examines the ways in which non-urban spaces were approached as objects of knowledge in Argentine and Brazilian essays, chronicles, and films in the 1960s. It is comprised of three case-studies. The first traces the role of spatial coordinates in 1960s' political imagination, reconstructed through programmes for economic modernization (developmentalist agendas and the Doctrine of National Security), through Frantz Fanon's thirdworldist understanding of political organization, and through Gunder Frank's version of Dependency theory. The second study centers upon Brazil's rural Northeast as evoked in Antônio Callado's chronicles and economist Celso Furtado's memoirs, that both simultaneously took up and challenged the terms by which developmentalism's mainly technical modernization sought to legitimate itself. The third case-study begins with the national horizon envisaged for Argentina by economist Rogelio Frigerio's apology of industrialization as an agent of social homogenization. This horizon is then contrasted with two investigations on marginal spaces: Fernando Birri's documentary film ""Tire dié"" and Roberto Carri's essay in which, by defining a new space, the ""area of colonial capitalism,"" Carri brings to the fore novel forms of political action. I situate each case-study at a crossroads between developmentalist hopes and blossoming liberation movements, demonstrating how each resignifies differently national and transnational coordinates. Critical theories of space, as well as intellectual history and discourse analysis constitute my readings' methodological base, guiding my analyses of aspects that are often overlooked in studies of 1960s culture, particularly as regards the constitution of militant subjectivities and trajectories. Inspired by David Harvey and Henri Lefebvre's theories and methods, I detect the constant presence of a technified prism in the spatial imagination of modernization, be it social or economic. I argue that the descriptive activity by which these marginal spaces are produced as objects of knowledge is also poetic as it approaches these decaying spaces from the vantage of a present defined by hopes in technical modernization as an agent of progress. As such, this descriptive and poetic activity amounts to a complex political intervention that articulates such spaces in function of specific temporalities and rhythms, rethinking critically their relation to imperialism and to capitalist modernization.",304640360,,Dissertations & Theses," Sadek, IsisSadekIsisSadek, Isis",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1507552001 , 39688731 , 66569 , 9780549492290 , 3297892 , 3297892", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549492290, Spanish, Spanish,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304640360?accountid=14496, 0312 Latin American literature, 0312 Latin American literature, 0312 Latin American literature,, 0312 Latin American literature, Latin American literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Argentina , Argentina - intellectual life - 20th century , Brazil , Brazil - intellectual life - 20th century , Brazil, northeast - history , Marginality, social - Argentina , Nineteen 60s , Nonurban spaces , Poetics , Politics , Space in literature",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Of+lands%2C+regions+and+zones%3A+The+poetics+and+politics+of+non-urban+spaces+in+the+1960s+in+Brazil+and+Argentina&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sadek%2C+Isis&amp;isbn=9780549492290&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Forging the organic -industrial divide: The National Organic Program and small -scale organic agriculture in New York State,"In the last two decades, organics has become the fastest growing sector in U.S. agriculture, transforming the organic movement into an organic industry. However, organic agriculture currently finds itself at a historical crossroads with the 2002 implementation of the USDA's National Organic Program (NOP), prompting several questions: To what degree will the NOP reflect the goals of the organic movement or work as a proxy for the conventionalization of organic agriculture? How will the NOP affect the structure of organic agriculture? Will the small-scale organic producers that traditionally formed the core of organic agriculture become marginalized or will they continue to thrive? To answer these questions, this work examines the role that the NOP plays in shaping the social organization of the organic marketplace. To begin with, utilizing agrarian political economy and food regime analysis this study places organics more centrally in the emerging trends of the global agro-food system by situating it within the larger historical context of modern food system. In doing so, it explores how agro-food movements, like organic agriculture, play a significant role in a modern food-system that is shaping up around the tensions between the drive by agro-food capital to further embed commodity relations in food production and the resistance to these efforts by agro-food movements. Next, this study examines the national organic standards in a normative framework, an organic standards moral economy, whereby normative conceptions that construct 'good' organic production are codified and institutionalized. This reveals how the NOP facilitates the expansion of a certified organic market that privileges industrially organized production. In addition, this study utilizes interviews with organic producers in New York State to show that, although the NOP is an instrumental tool in reshaping the organic sector to favor conventional practices, due to a complex mix of economic and non-economic factors, the agrarian footprint in New York State supports a market space where small-scale producers are able to thrive. Lastly, this study concludes that there is increasing polarization in the organic marketplace along the lines of a sector organized by market values and one organized by the non-market values.",304641460,,Dissertations & Theses," Kreider, Robin PaigeKreiderPaigeRobinKreider, Robin Paige",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1464130621 , 38920501 , 66569 , 9780549429920 , 3295812 , 3295812", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549429920, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304641460?accountid=14496," 0473 Agriculture , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0473 Agriculture , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," 0473 Agriculture , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure",," 0473 Agriculture , 0626 Sociology , 0700 Social structure"," Agriculture , Sociology , Social structure"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Alternative agriculture , Certification , NOP , National Organic Program , New York , New York State , Organic agriculture , Regulation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Forging+the+organic+-industrial+divide%3A++The+National+Organic+Program+and+small+-scale+organic+agriculture+in+New+York+State&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kreider%2C+Robin+Paige&amp;isbn=9780549429920&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Goracle's travels: Re -visioning knowledge and community for climate change in “An Inconvenient Truth”,"On May 24, 2006 Al Gore’s An Inconvenient Truth: A Global Warning lit the stage at Sundance. On April 25, 2007, the film won “Best Documentary Film” at the 2006 Academy Awards. To this date AIT is the fourth highest grossing documentary in the United States. And on October 12, 2007, Al Gore won (half of) the Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts in climate change awareness and policy. Needless to say, the point has tipped for climate change, and Al Gore’s presentation-turned-documentary-film is front and center in this phenomenon. This study is a rhetorical analysis of An Inconvenient Truth that seeks to understand the rhetorical features of the film that may help to explain its surprising imprint on a social plain flooded by antagonism and controversy. This study begins with the assertion that the domains of knowledge and identity/community have been among the most affected by the “infinitude” that characterizes the postmodern social scape. In spite of this indeterminacy and flux, social movements and policies depend upon the suturing of provisional knowledge and community. To this end this study examines AIT in terms of its rhetorical appeals to knowledge and community, revealing two important features of the film: first, the articulation of a community for climate change through the rhetorical construction of three complex and competing stages; and second, the articulation of knowledge about climate change through three related journeys.",304641601,,Dissertations & Theses," Vogelaar, Alison E.VogelaarE.AlisonVogelaar, Alison E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1650512311 , 40101271 , 66569 , 9780549919292 , 3337219 , 3337219", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549919292, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304641601?accountid=14496, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications, 0708 Mass communications,, 0708 Mass communications, Mass communications," Communication and the arts , An Inconvenient Truth , Climate change , Gore, Al , Postmodernity , Rhetoric",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Goracle%27s+travels%3A+Re+-visioning+knowledge+and+community+for+climate+change+in+%E2%80%9CAn+Inconvenient+Truth%E2%80%9D&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vogelaar%2C+Alison+E.&amp;isbn=9780549919292&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Captive to freedom: Urban guerrillas and the West German state in the 1970s,"This project investigates both official and public reactions to the spate of anti-state violence carried out by leftwing extremists in West Germany throughout the 1970s. Political leaders struggled to balance the state's dual commitment to domestic security and civil liberties during this period, as more than two hundred embittered young Germans coalesced into underground urban guerrilla cells dedicated to bringing the global anti-imperialist struggle home to the metropole. Although militant organizations such as the Red Army Faction grossly underestimated the willingness of the general public to tolerate violence as a legitimate political means, and thus failed to incite class revolution in West Germany, their actions sparked a proliferation of discourses on the nature of democracy and state power. This study considers the ways in which urban guerilla violence threatened the governability of a nation endeavoring to establish a democratic order defined explicitly in contrast to its communist neighbor and freed from the burdens of its own Nazi past. While scholars have tended to condemn overzealous bureaucrats and irresponsible journalists for allegedly overreacting to leftwing terrorism, my study reveals the state's counter-terror policy to have been a pragmatic product of political exigencies. After assuming power in 1969, the ruling coalition of Social Democrats and Liberals attempted to respond to demands from their conservative counterparts as well as popular pressures from below to take more resolute measures to combat violent extremism. The Federal Republic's Social, Free, and Christian Democrats gradually established a common vision for the ideal German state as a polity grounded in anti-fascism and anti-communism, and constantly vigilant against threats to its democratic order. The ways in which West German guerrillas understood their movement and the responses their violence generated were shaped by a uniquely German set of circumstances, including the specter of the National Socialist past and the polarized politics of the Cold War. Nevertheless, by unraveling reactions to leftwing terrorism in West Germany over an entire decade, this study opens up avenues of exploration which allow us to contemplate and compare the dynamics of terror and counter-terror in a variety of historical and regional contexts.",304650130,,Dissertations & Theses," Rosenfeld, Alan IraRosenfeldIraAlanRosenfeld, Alan Ira",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1558786551 , 40416771 , 66569 , 9780549682127 , 3318722 , 3318722", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549682127, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304650130?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history",," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," European history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Germany , Leftwing violence , Nineteen70s , Political extremism , Red Army Faction , Terrorism , Urban guerrillas , West Germany",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Captive+to+freedom%3A+Urban+guerrillas+and+the+West+German+state+in+the+1970s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rosenfeld%2C+Alan+Ira&amp;isbn=9780549682127&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A community of sentiment: Indo -Fijian music and identity discourse in Fiji and its diaspora,"Through an historical and ethnographic account of Indo-Fijian music and related cultural practices, this dissertation examines the co-implicative relationship between music making and collective identity formation. Indo-Fijians, who compose about 37 percent of Fiji's current population, descend primarily from colonial-era Indian laborers. Specifically, I interpret discourses about music and discourses of music to query three broad intersections of musical performance and ""community"": (1) the ""subethnic,"" in which the heterogeneous ""Indo-Fijian community"" negotiates internal difference; (2) the national, in which fraught social and political relationships between Indo-Fijians and indigenous Fijians—the majority population—inhibit their co-authoring of the nation-state; and (3) the transnational, in which global media and diasporic movements engender new points of attachment and concepts of community. As a point of focus, my ethnography explores the folk-based devotional music repertoire performed by Hindus, the majority Indo-Fijian religious group. This dissertation rests on the claim that musical performance offers an ethnographically distinct site of cultural production, constitutive and revelatory of multiple points of suture that inform an individual's sense of self in society. As a discursive practice, music signals difference, but it also harnesses the sentiment of attachment to concepts of time and place and points imaginatively at other possibilities for being. Both in Fiji and in locations of ""secondary migration"" in Pacific Rim metropols, musical practices contribute to the internal constitution of communities and the mapping of their borders. In the context of Hindu practices, this process is interconnected with a local discourse that places various musical elements into a hierarchy based on religious efficaciousness (and perceived cultural worth) that I call ""viable authenticity."" The three primary discursive sources for viable authenticity in Indo-Fijian music-culture are ""rural memory,"" which valorizes performance elements associated with the (indentured) past; ""Bollywood,"" which draws on aesthetics and ideologies associated with a modern but imagined India; and classicization, which simultaneously claims the superiority of an ancient Indian past and a global affinity with the standardized, ""elevated"" practice of semiclassical and classical Indian music.",304651907,,Dissertations & Theses," Miller, Kevin ChristopherMillerChristopherKevinMiller, Kevin Christopher",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1582037101 , 39240051 , 66569 , 9780549724049 , 3322052 , 3322052", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549724049, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304651907?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music"," Cultural anthropology , Folklore , Music"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Diaspora , Discourse , Fiji , Identity , India , Music",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+community+of+sentiment%3A+Indo+-Fijian+music+and+identity+discourse+in+Fiji+and+its+diaspora&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Miller%2C+Kevin+Christopher&amp;isbn=9780549724049&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Contesting citizenship: Race, gender, and the politics of participation in the U.S. and Japanese welfare states, 1962–1982","Contesting Citizenship compares African American welfare activism in Los Angeles with the zainichi Korean battles for welfare rights in Kawasaki during the 1960s and 1970s. A comparison of these two struggles affords us unique insights into the contested nature of citizenship during the period of welfare state expansion in the U.S. and Japan. It investigates both institutional discourses and the ways in which they were challenged by grass-roots organizations. It puts the case of the American Community Action Program (CAP), a core program of President Lyndon B. Johnson's “War on Poverty,” in a transnational context by introducing the case of the Japanese Model Community Program (MCP). Both CAP and MCP were political responses to perceived national “crises” brought about by social movements in the 1960s. Also, both programs produced gendered and racialized notions of citizenship and “community.” Nevertheless, CAP and MCP yielded different results for black Angelenos and Kawasaki Koreans, respectively. In CAP, the idea of the program as a vehicle for fostering the participation of African Americans and the “poor,” coexisted with the notion that “maximum feasible participation” would simply be a symbolic gesture. Black Angelenos took advantage of this ambiguous aspect of CAP. Once the programs were initiated, they fought to transform the concept of “maximum feasible participation” into a pathway through which new political opportunities could be pursued. The MCP, on the other hand, became an apparatus in recreating a racialized national orthodoxy. While the Japanese government utilized citizenship as an excuse to deny former colonial subjects access to the expanding welfare state, Kawasaki Koreans asserted their citizenship rights in the fields of welfare and education. Furthermore, antiracist networking with African American church leaders had empowered Kawasaki Koreans to contest the narrow definition of citizenship in postwar Kawasaki and Japan. African Americans and zainichi Koreans stood at the center of debates about citizenship and welfare during an era of massive welfare expansion. I argue that the scholarship on the welfare state must register the agency of subjugated individuals, and locate them as historical actors in the formation of welfare programs and policy.",304660283,,Dissertations & Theses," Tsuchiya, KazuyoTsuchiyaKazuyoTsuchiya, Kazuyo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1637577451 , 40010561 , 66569 , 9780549902409 , 3336649 , 3336649", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549902409, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304660283?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0631 Ethnic studies"," History , American history , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , African-Americans , California , Gender , Japan , Kawasaki , Koreans in Japan , Los Angeles , Race , Transnational history , War on Poverty , Welfare states",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contesting+citizenship%3A+Race%2C+gender%2C+and+the+politics+of+participation%0Ain+the+U.S.+and+Japanese+welfare+states%2C+1962%E2%80%931982&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tsuchiya%2C+Kazuyo&amp;isbn=9780549902409&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Cultivating rights: Russia's rights defenders and the interstices of formal and informal morality,"In the Soviet Union, open dissent was distinct but limited. The culture of opposing the state has continued, however, with the so-called rights defenders, whose organizations, practices, and values are modified continuations and elaborations of the Soviet dissident movement. Now, as then, this kind of activism constitutes a minority of beliefs in the legitimacy and plausibility of law and political and civil rights amid widespread political cynicism and reliance on informal morality. This dissertation examines how rights defenders conceptualize the moral legitimacy of formal law and rights as enshrined in the Russian constitution, Russian statutes, and International treaties on civil and human rights. It simultaneously looks at everyday beliefs of non-activists and their close connection to the informal domain of social life. Contrasting the formal and informal domains as historically disjointed realms of moral meaning in Russia, the dissertations examines the role of imagination, metaphor, and emotion in either maintaining this divide, or — in the case of believing rights defenders — bridging it.

This research explores how place-based education can promote sustainability of a community food system in which feedbacks between production and consumption are integrated within a biocultural region. Through participatory action research, the project develops and demonstrates pedagogical components of sustainability that are applicable to formal and non-formal educational contexts. In this pedagogy, the purpose of sustainability education is to foster a community culture that will promote the emergence of sustainability in complex adaptive systems with social and ecological components. This work is based at the Effie Kokrine Charter School (EKCS), a junior-senior high school in Fairbanks, Alaska that teaches with an Alaska Native approach, emphasizing place-based, experiential, and holistic education by utilizing students' natural and human communities to facilitate learning. The collaborative design of an Interior Alaska gardening curriculum serves as both an organizing framework for the project's fieldwork as well as an outcome of the research. The resultant gardening curriculum and the rationale behind its design demonstrate components of pedagogy for sustainability, including systems thinking, place-based and problem-based learning, eco-cultural literacy, eco-justice values, and appropriate assessment. Sustainability pedagogy within settings of higher education should also include action research. The structure of this dissertation research reflects how action research incorporates components of sustainability pedagogy. This pedagogical framework has theoretical and practical implications in multiple educational settings and indicates ways for our educational institutions to participate in the global sustainability revolution.",304683763,,Dissertations & Theses," Henry-Stone, Laura R.Henry-StoneR.LauraHenry-Stone, Laura R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1581660721 , 40813711 , 66569 , 9780549731566 , 3322395 , 3322395", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549731566, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304683763?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0534 Social studies education"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0534 Social studies education"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0534 Social studies education",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0534 Social studies education"," Cultural anthropology , Social studies education"," Social sciences , Education , Alaska , Alaska Native , Community food systems , Education , Food systems , Participatory action research , Place-based , Place-based education , Sustainability",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultivating+sustainability+through+participatory+action+research%3A+Place+-based+education+and+community+food+systems+in+Interior+Alaska&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Henry-Stone%2C+Laura+R.&amp;isbn=9780549731566&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Kodály method in Taiwan: Its introduction and adaptation to elementary music education, 1987–2000","The purpose of this study was to examine the introduction and adaptation of the Kodály method in Taiwan through the year 2000, with special emphasis on elementary music education. Elementary music education in Taiwan evolved through five major periods. The influences came from the Netherlands, Spain, Ming/Qing China, Japan, and the Republic of China. The Taiwan democratization movement helped to pave the way for acceptance of new international music education methods. The Kodály method arrived in Taiwan during a democratic era: the 1980s. This was a period of dramatic social changes and major reforms in elementary education. This Hungarian method came to Taiwan through North America. Although the method was introduced by several foreign Kodály teachers it had little influence until several foreign-trained Taiwanese Kodály teachers cooperated to promote the method through the Taiwan Kodály Society (TICS) and several teacher in-service training programs. As a result, the method became better known among elementary music educators than before, but it was still not widely accepted. Kodály enthusiasts faced many challenges in Taiwan, and the adaptation of the Kodály method there has been difficult. The challenges were similar to those faced by other international music educators when introducing the method to their countries. Among other problems, inadequate collaboration with foreign music educators and insufficient participation in international events resulted in a partial understanding of the Kodály method on the part of Taiwanese music educators. The lack of governmental support contributed to the lack of general acceptance in Taiwan as well. Despite the problems encountered, the Kodály method would seem to be highly suitable for teaching indigenous folk music because it relies on movable- do systems, something it shares with traditional music teaching techniques. It could be adapted as the framework to develop an elementary music education system for Taiwan. The incorporation of traditional tools used to teach Taiwanese indigenous folk music could add authenticity and provide diversity in learning music.",304685866,,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, Ying-ShuLiuYing-ShuLiu, Ying-Shu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1472137171 , 39056491 , 66569 , 9780549453154 , 3300666 , 3300666", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549453154, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304685866?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education , 0524 Elementary education"," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education , 0524 Elementary education"," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education , 0524 Elementary education",," 0413 Music , 0522 Music education , 0524 Elementary education"," Music , Music education , Elementary education"," Communication and the arts , Education , Adaptation , China , Elementary , Introduction , Kodaly method , Music education , Taiwan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Kod%C3%A1ly+method+in+Taiwan%3A+Its+introduction+and+adaptation%0Ato+elementary+music+education%2C+1987%E2%80%932000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Ying-Shu&amp;isbn=9780549453154&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Bounding danger: Geopolitics, territoriality, and the displacement of terror","This research builds on theories of geopolitics as discourse in examining how popular media are implicated in the production of emerging state forms in the context of the War on Terrorism. The world is increasingly marked by movement, flows, and communication that transcend political boundaries and challenge the territorial integrity of the state. Contemporary terrorism reflects these processes and is defined by relations of abjection that blur the distinctions between friend and foe. Despite the difficulty in locating terrorism, the popular idea of the state as a container of political, social, and economic processes remains influential. The state is an ongoing mediated creation that serves as an anchor of identity in an uncertain imaginary of terror. This dissertation argues the state centered discourse of terrorism is sustained through multi-scalar narratives of Muslims that reterritorialize an amorphous terror threat across a transnational imaginary of fear. The ongoing mediation of the state is a geopolitical struggle to reterritorialize the danger of contemporary terrorism as an outside threat. It is a struggle over place, scale, and identity to define an exceptional nation in an uncertain global imaginary of friends and enemies. Terrorism is reterritorialized as a bounded danger through exceptional logics of identity sustained by ‘geopolitics of displacement’. This is a performance of otherness through narratives of place, scale, and identity that resolves the indeterminate potentiality of the abject relations of terrorism. This research reveals how ‘geopolitics of displacement’ materializes the distinction between foreign and domestic and maintains the illusion of the state as a distinct political and cultural entity.",304686242,,Dissertations & Theses," Tracy, Matthew J.TracyJ.MatthewTracy, Matthew J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1619075221 , 39375151 , 66569 , 9780549887836 , 3335263 , 3335263", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549887836, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304686242?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," Social sciences , Geopolitics , Identity , Media , Muslim , Territoriality , War on Terrorism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bounding+danger%3A++Geopolitics%2C+territoriality%2C+and+the+displacement+of+terror&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tracy%2C+Matthew+J.&amp;isbn=9780549887836&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""“Chinese investigations”: Immigration policy enforcement in Cold War New York Chinatown, 1946–1965","A 1957 Immigration and Naturalization Service investigators' manual entitled ""Chinese Investigations"" gives the transnational security investigation examined herein its name. This dissertation focuses on federal immigration policy enforcement including criminal immigration violations, ideological deportations under McCarthyism, and also the prosecution of a Chinese-language daily newspaper under the Trading with the Enemy Act. Chinese paternity blood testing was affirmed. Some New York Chinese immigration brokers were convicted between 1956 and 1961 for conspiracy to violate immigration laws and for false statements on passport applications. In 1942, the federal government removed Japanese Americans from the West Coast and, believing individual loyalty determinations, interned them all in inland concentration camps. Through partisan politics anticommunism increasingly infused U.S. elections and governance after World War Two. After the 1949 Chinese Revolution and during the Korean War, U.S. government agencies feared Chinese Americans might be either loyal to or subject to the influence of Chinese communism. They however escaped en masse imprisonment even though the U.S. national security state's formal law by then allowed it. Chinese Americans experienced a variant of ""McCarthyism"" from the mid-1950s in New York City that constituted a domestic application of the Cold War U.S. foreign policy strategy of containment. This dissertation names it as domestic containment. Chinese Americans all over the country cooperated with a federal interagency investigation that, in effect, made the individual loyalty determinations that Japanese Americans did not receive. Any Chinese ""subversive aliens"" exposed under it could be deported. This dissertation thus adds: (1) to the history of racism in U.S. law; (2) to Chinese American history; and (3), a missing link to the modern American history of political repression. During the 1950s and 1960s, peace and civil rights activists opposing national and state policy often came under federal and local political surveillance. Federal agents targeted various social movements from the 1950s well into the 1970s. By the 1960s, some agencies systematically disrupted U.S. political dissenters' activities through covert action. Enhancing our understanding of the domestic Cold War, or McCarthyism, this dissertation breaks further ground in post-war American civil liberties, immigration, constitutional, civil rights, and legal history.",304693935,,Dissertations & Theses," Torok, John EdwardTorokEdwardJohnTorok, John Edward",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1790128671 , 41262451 , 66569 , 9781109097191 , 3353282 , 3353282", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109097191, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304693935?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American history , Law , Ethnic studies , Immigration policy , Cold War , Chinatown-New York City NY"," Social sciences , Chinatown , Chinese-American , Civil liberties , Cold War , Immigration policy , Immigration policy or law , McCarthyism , New York , New York City",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CChinese+investigations%E2%80%9D%3A+Immigration+policy+enforcement+in+Cold+War+New+York+Chinatown%2C+1946%E2%80%931965&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Torok%2C+John+Edward&amp;isbn=9781109097191&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,Ethnic NewsWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Evolution of geography in the United States' public school curriculum: An analysis of the influence of societal movements and historical events,"The purpose of this study was to analyze the evolution of geography in the United States' primary and secondary education system throughout the nineteenth century to the initial years of the twenty-first century to determine the causes of variations, shifts in focus, and relative importance placed on geography curricula that have defined the position of the subject as a stand-alone discipline and as an integrated part of the social studies. A broad theoretical framework guided the process of data collection and analysis. This theoretical perspective, resonating largely from sociologists of education and education philosophers and historians, states that national and international societal movements and historical events play a significant role in how schools develop their objectives and curricula in K-12 education. Additionally, this theoretical framework along with an historical-qualitative research methodology allow for retroactive predictions of the relationships between historical and societal circumstances that have influenced the curricular position of geography education. Analysis and interpretation falls into two categories: (1) findings in light of the study's seven research questions; and, (2) findings in light of the theoretical framework. Data extrapolated and analyzed from numerous sources provide support for the idea that national and international events have profoundly affected the K-12 education system, generally, and the evolutionary course of school geography, specifically. This study reveals that, aside from the nineteenth century in which the discipline was a prominent subject of study, the discipline's parent organizations and academic scholars failed to meet society's demands and the needs of education as they neglected matters pertaining to K-12 geography education, which resulted in the marginalization of geography education. Beginning in the early twentieth century, in effect, geography education stood at the periphery of public education—a position that has characterized geography since. Therefore, until geography education, the parent organizations, and academic scholars satisfy the six theoretical variables and the four theoretical propositions, the discipline might continue to maintain a marginal position or, more bleak, lose identity as an identifiable, stand-alone subject of study in the United States' primary and secondary education system.",304817359,,Dissertations & Theses," Moore, Zachary A.MooreA.ZacharyMoore, Zachary A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1734290811 , 40765691 , 66569 , 9781109101232 , 3353658 , 3353658", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109101232, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304817359?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0520 Education history , 0534 Social studies education , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0366 Geography , 0520 Education history , 0534 Social studies education , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0366 Geography , 0520 Education history , 0534 Social studies education , 0727 Curriculum development",," 0366 Geography , 0520 Education history , 0534 Social studies education , 0727 Curriculum development"," Geography , Education history , Social studies education , Curriculum development"," Social sciences , Education , Geographic education , Geography education , Historical geography , History of school geography , K-12 education , Public school geography , Social studies , Societal movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Evolution+of+geography+in+the+United+States%27+public+school+curriculum%3A+An+analysis+of+the+influence+of+societal+movements+and+historical+events&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moore%2C+Zachary+A.&amp;isbn=9781109101232&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"China's American -educated youths and the quest for the Kingdom of God: A case study of the Chinese Students' Christian Association in North America (1909–1951),"One of the most striking phenomena in the first half of the 20th century was the influx of Chinese intellectuals into America to receive Western education. Studies in the past, however, often depicted the history of American-educated Chinese students simply as the history of Chinese students returning from America. For a long time the foreign exposure and experience of the Chinese intellectuals did not draw enough attention from the academia. If we agree that one of the valuable contributions that the West can make to China was the spiritual values in Western civilization, the encounter between the intellectuals and the Christian idealism would probably be a very important issue. It is not the purpose of this research to re-write the history of American-returned students in any depth. The author would like to focus on a group of “China's American-educated youths” who has encountered modern Christianity. Although they were not all followers or baptized Christians, they adhered to the principles of Christianity as the highest standard for measuring the changing circumstances in China and in the world. To unite the Chinese Christians in the United States, the Chinese Students' Christian Association in North America was founded in 1909 by a group of Chinese Christian students. The objective of the Association was similar to the Young Men's Christian Association. Through a case study of the Chinese Students' Christian Association in North America, the author attempts to depict the spiritual feature of the American-educated Chinese students as a single group. This dissertation argues that they intentionally chose the social gospel, which adopted the Kingdom of God as the key concept, in the quest fort he modern religious belief. By making critical assessment and judgment on the non-Christian order in the society, political arena and the internationals cene, they longed for the realization of the earthly democratic kingdom which suited to the home country and the world. Disappointed in politics, the China's American-educated youths did not turn into mere spectators. The Christian idealism made them profoundly aware of the sociopolitical realm of China and the world. This thirst for a Kingdom of God became the driving force for the continuous development of the students' Christian movement.",304820038,,Dissertations & Theses," Leung, Koon TingLeungTingKoonLeung, Koon Ting",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1825840921 , 47680411 , 66569 , 9781109225877 , 3362953 , 3362953", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9781109225877, Chinese, Chinese,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304820038?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0626 Sociology"," Religion , American studies , Sociology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , 20th century American-educated Chinese , American Chinese , American-educated , Chinese Christian students , Chinese Students' Christian Association in North America , Chinese students in United States , Christian , Christian idealism , Christianity in China , Intellectuals",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=China%27s+American+-educated+youths+and+the+quest+for+the%0AKingdom+of+God%3A+A+case+study+of+the+Chinese+Students%27+Christian+Association+in+North+America+%281909%E2%80%931951%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Leung%2C+Koon+Ting&amp;isbn=9781109225877&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Power, culture, and sustainability in the making of public policy in an Appalachian headwaters community","The dominant economic paradigm in this headwaters region of western North Carolina is pro-growth. This objectifies and commodifies the environment and marginalizes a subaltern citizen class. Sustainability discourses remain in the margins as rapacious real estate development approaches overshoot of the community's water supply, triggers major shifts in land use, and threatens lifeways. This study sees the cultural as a site of contestation between pro-growth and sustainability ideologies. Three questions were posed in a discursive and structural analysis of dominant and subaltern actors' agency as they contested issues of sustainability: (1) Is sustainability a movement or is it imbedded in other movements? (2) How do actors contest agency as voices for sustainability? (3) Under what conditions can a local-level counter-discourse for sustainability emerge? Situated as a participant-observer, the researcher aimed for a ""movement-relevant theory"" of sustainability, framed by the heuristic and analytical concepts of Satterfield's ""triangular shape of cultural production"" and Dryzek's ""environmental discourse classifications."" Peak oil, global warming, and neoliberal ideology were introduced into the critique. The multi-sited ethnography derived data from public policy venues and other community spaces where deliberations were held on water supply, steep slope development, and mountain ridge wind energy. The data revealed multi-faceted regimes appropriated by the pro-growth dominant discourse and more limited discourses available to fractured groups of subaltern actors. The classification of discourses appropriated by environmentalist subalterns produced opportunities for dominant and local subaltern actors to marginalize sustainability. The implications for scholars and activists include insights for successful social action as well as further research in advancing sustainability praxis. The findings suggest necessary pre-conditions under which movements for justice and sustainability may succeed. A more flexible and innovative approach by environmentalist and sustainability advocates is required. The key to successful movement building is a project for rural sustainable development that utilizes innovative hybrid organizations and citizen participation for capacity building. A truth-seeking ""rational public"" is necessary; but how movements contest powerful truth-making regimes remains the strategic question. As this study shows, complex challenges must be met at the local and regional levels if sustainable communities and a sustainable world are possible.",304820507,,Dissertations & Theses," Owen, Stephen M.OwenM.StephenOwen, Stephen M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1604628001 , 39239511 , 66569 , 9780549706014 , 3319362 , 3319362", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549706014, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304820507?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0999 Urban planning"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0999 Urban planning"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0999 Urban planning",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0999 Urban planning"," Cultural anthropology , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Appalachia , Culture , Development , Headwaters community , North Carolina , Political ecology , Public discourse , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Power%2C+culture%2C+and+sustainability+in+the+making+of+public+policy+in+an+Appalachian+headwaters+community&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Owen%2C+Stephen+M.&amp;isbn=9780549706014&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A minor theory of the transit of materiality into discourse, &lt;i&gt; via&lt;/i&gt; Campesina","In this thesis I explore how the material properties of plant seed enter the political discourses of the international peasant coalition the Via Campesina and coalition member the National Farmers Union of Canada (NFU), querying how this process might be employed as a resource for a transformative eco-social politics.

The works criticized in this analysis come from First Wave feminism's foundational writers Mary Wollstonecraft and Virginia Woof; Second Wave feminist writers Gloria Steinem, Adrienne Rich and Alice Walker, and from Third Wave feminism as a cyber-discourse, with attention to Jennifer Baumgardner and Amy Richards, Kristen Rowe-Finkbeiner and Ariel Levy. The lens I view these works through comes from landmark French feminists Simone de Beauvoir and Luce Irigaray, providing a theory of existentialism, linguistic construction and thus, social construction to describes the box in which the writers of each feminist wave function. By deconstructing each of the rhetorical works using the lens of the French feminists, my goal is to recognize and deconstruct the foundations of Wollstonecraft and Woolfe as inherently male and thus, proscribing an essentialism to women that does not speak for women of other races, cultures or social classes but in fact, exoticizes these women as ""other.""",89266101,,Dissertations & Theses," Janowick, TaraJanowickTaraJanowick, Tara",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1559850881 , 40436031 , 66569 , 9780549605287 , 1454029 , 1454029", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008, 9780549605287, English, English,,2008,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/89266101?accountid=14496," 0298 Literature , 0453 Womens studies"," 0298 Literature , 0453 Womens studies"," 0298 Literature , 0453 Womens studies",," 0298 Literature , 0453 Womens studies"," Literature , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Feminist+discourse+across+the+waves%3A+A+rhetorical+criticism+of+first%2C+second+and+third+wave+women%27s+discourse&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Janowick%2C+Tara&amp;isbn=9780549605287&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Fulani girls in New York City: Identities, family and schooling","The dissertation examines the critical issues of ethnic and gender identities through the lives of Fulani girls in New York City (NYC), and, in a public international high school in the City exploring their efforts to fit-in within their multiple worlds while at the same time maintaining their allegiance to their Fulani and Muslim cultures. Using participant observations within the school, homes, weddings and birthday parties, as well as drawing on interviews and informal conversations with the girls, their families, friends and teachers, this dissertation invites a new lens of analyzing and theorizing assimilation of immigrants groups and their education attainment. Data demonstrates that not only are immigrant identities shaped by their cultural capital or their context of reception but that school and family play a great role in determining to which segment of the American social structure they will assimilate into. In addition, this dissertation portrays the local trajectories of new immigrant girls residing in a poor neighborhood attending a poor school but who eschew the ways of their American minority neighbors. The girls romanticize their lives in Africa which fuels their desire to return “home.” To live in different cultures, they mix and match aspects from the new country to their old by actively subverting their parents' authority although these decisions are made within the confines of their culture. Families respond through restrictions of movement and association via a system of policing by others within the ethnic group in NYC and Africa based on the Fulani gender roles of women. While research shows that these restrictions lead to improved academic performance for immigrant girls, in this study, restrictions made them love school but mostly as a place to escape from home and the restrictive and confining cultural and religious practices. Data demonstrates that school as a social field through the formal and informal curriculum together with the larger forces which shape contemporary life in NYC entwined to form a space for the girls' creation and recreation of expectations and obligations which put to question the traditional role of schooling among immigrants in America.",89298762,,Dissertations & Theses," Kasirye, Gillian K.KasiryeK.GillianKasirye, Gillian K.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

The aim was to examine factors considered to cultivate human strength. It was hypothesised that hope and perceived social support will be associated with and will predict participantsâ�� subjective life satisfaction. Secondary objectives were to investigate how well the data obtained supported the theoretical models upon which the questionnaires were based. This quantitative study utilised a cross-sectional design. One hundred and fourteen participants from the community aged between 21 to 65 years, completed questionnaires regarding perceived social support (Medical Outcomes Study Social Support Survey), hope (Adult State Hope and the Adult Trait Hope Scales), and subjective life satisfaction (The Satisfaction With Life Scale).Â  Participants were approached in shopping areas in London and Surrey. The main hypotheses were partly supported by results. All dimensions of hope and social support were found to relate significantly with subjective life satisfaction. Agency, which refers to the individualâ��s perceived capacity to initiate and sustain actions towards desired goals, emerged as the most significant predictor of subjective life satisfaction.Â  Global Perceived social support was found to be a stronger predictor of subjective life satisfaction than global hope.

As for a comprehensive understanding of the social dimension of the global restructuring in South Korea, this thesis sheds light on the transition of the developmental state over the time of the financial crisis.Â  The economic crisis in 1997 played a decisive role in the inclusion of trade unionism in the political institutional arena, and yet at the same time weakened the organisational strength of unions in each workplace.Â  Similarly, the consolidation of democracy at that time has accelerated the incorporation of women-related issues into the state apparatus, which has undertaken gender mainstreaming policies as well as encouraged activists from womenâ��s movement groups to participate in the decision-making body.Â  However, it will be argued that this has resulted in new forms of politics of exclusion as well as of inclusion, since the economic restructuring process has intensified gender inequality in the labour market and crisis tendencies of social reproduction.Â  Therefore, it is argued that the women-only trade unions formed in the absence of a forum for women workersâ�� representation should be seen as the resistance against the gendered reconfiguration of the political economy of South Korea.Â  As such, this thesis makes a contribution to enriching the discipline of International Political Economy by engendering the transformation of the Korean developmental state, moving beyond the critique of the failure of the state or the market and by shifting the perspective from high politics to the subjects coping with global restructuring locally.",899713973,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, J.LeeJ.Lee, J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491196491 , 48520631 , 101309 , U500274 , U500274", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899713973?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," DXN122024 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+restructuring+and+gender+politics+in+South+Korea%3A+the+analysis+of+the+formation+of+women-only+trade+unions+after+the+economic+crisis+in+1997-98&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+J.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Venezuela: global counter-hegemony, geographies of regional development, and higher education for all","This study advances the thesis that the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela is driving a counter-hegemonic globalisation project centred around the idea of â��21 st century socialismâ��, in which the regionalisation and globalisation of Venezuelaâ��s endogenous development finds its most advanced and explicit expression in the Bolivarian Alternative for the peoples of our America (ALBA).Â  The multi-dimensional inter- and transnational processes operate within and across a range of sectors and scales whilst the structural transformations are driven by an interplay of state and non-state actors, the latter increasingly operating in a â��transnational organised societyâ��.Â  The Venezuelan governmentâ��s Higher Education For All (HEFA) strategy, as operationalised through the Bolivarian University of Venezuela (UBV), assumes a central role in the direct democratic and participatory democratic processes upon which a bottom-up construction of counter-hegemony depends. The study is framed by a critical theory approach, and based on 13 months of participatory ethnographic fieldwork in a municipalized UBV in Venezuela.Â  An expression of moral and ethical commitment to a more equitable world, the research exercises solidarity with the counter-hegemonic processes currently driven by a growing number of progressive governments and social, popular movements in the emergent Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) region.Â  It also contributes to the development of a counter-hegemonic globalisation theory. The thesis analyses the conjunction of projects, processes and politics at work and shows how these are being mobilised through the strategic use of scale.Â  The adopted approach systematically explores the set of dynamics involved, starting with the social contradiction in hegemonic globalisation and the crisis of hegemony in pre-revolutionary Venezuela.Â  This is followed by a discussion of the resurgence of the Left in LAC, a theorisation of Venezuelaâ��s â��revolutionary democracyâ�� as the key feature of 21 st century socialism, and its regionalisation as ALBA.Â  These processes involve a re-scaling of state power to the subnational as well as transnational scales.Â  At the local scale, HEFA and the UBVâ��s practice of participatory action research (PAR) is explored within the context of a marginalised urban neighbourhood in Venezuela.",899722787,,Dissertations & Theses," Muhr, ThomasMuhrThomasMuhr, Thomas",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491186751 , 64958191 , 101309 , U521085 , U521085", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899722787?accountid=14496, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0515 Education, Education," 499925 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Venezuela%3A+global+counter-hegemony%2C+geographies+of+regional+development%2C+and+higher+education+for+all&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Muhr%2C+Thomas&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Public policy and social movements: the cases of Bolivia and Mexico,"This thesis studies policy formation and implementation in Latin America in their interaction with processes of contentious politics and social mobilisation.Â  It compares two case studies in the area of urban and physical infrastructure.Â  The first one is the privatisation of water and sanitation services (WSS) in Cochabamba, Bolivia which was overturned in 2000 after opposing groups mobilised against the increase of fees and new water regulations that were deemed to be excessively biased towards the interests of private investors.Â  This conflict has become known in the literature as the â��Cochabamba Water Warâ��.Â  The second case is the project for a new international airport in Mexico City, which was promoted in 2001 and cancelled only one year later after analogous protests. The thesis combines concepts and heuristic tools from both public policy and social movement theories.Â  This approach provides insights into how policy formation and policy implementation may trigger processes of social mobilisation and how in turn, contentious collective action may influence policy outcomes.Â  The comparison of competing narratives and discourses about the same policy initiative is fundamental to the analysis of policy-making.Â  Despite their contextual and historical-structural differences, the comparison between the two case studies identifies common patterns of policy making and social mobilisation.Â  Located in the broader picture of development and democracy in Latin America, the analysis of these patterns suggests various challenges and obstacles that the region faces in order to address the problem of infrastructure policy in the following decades.Â  Challenges include the divide between narrow conceptions of technical feasibility and the broad dictates of democratic participation; the emergence of new arenas for political competition; and the stateâ��s legitimacy gap regarding the achievement of development goals.",899725208,,Dissertations & Theses," Dominguez, J.C.DominguezJ.C.Dominguez, J.C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491196081 , 48520591 , 101309 , U519705 , U519705", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899725208?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," 496442 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Public+policy+and+social+movements%3A+the+cases+of+Bolivia+and+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dominguez%2C+J.C.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Social responsibility networks in the banana industry: the role of corporate social responsibility and the international civil society in improving working and living conditions in the banana industry.,"This PhD provides a multidisciplinary theoretical perspective and an in-depth empirical understanding of the role and the impact of corporate social responsibility (CSR) and the international civil society on working and living conditions in the banana industry in Colombia, whilst analysing the developing nature of the relationships within the environment of emerging social responsibility networks (SRN). The emergence of what seems to be â��ethically-modified organismsâ�� has been a response to market incentives which reward well-behaved brands whose offered goods and services are guilt-free, and whose labour and environmental behaviours are accountable and traceable.Â  Nevertheless, the financial costs associated with certifications are generally passed to producers. Globalisation has facilitated the disintegration of production and its reintegration through trade.Â  This has led to complex value chains in the banana industry.Â  An important consequence is the transnationalisation of labour relations dimensions, and the evolution of diverse forms of worker representation. These dynamics are traceable throughout formal and informal SRNs through which socially responsible behaviour is defined, monitored and enforced through the value chains.Â  These networks consist of multiple stakeholders at various points of the production, distribution and marketing processes and include relationships amongst stakeholders.Â  Actors in such networks include transnational non-governmental organisations, trade unions, community based organisations, social movements, political parties and state agencies.Â  These new actors in industrial relations, networks and coalitions of actors offer scope for new forms of workers representation. This research combines value chain analysis with ethnographic methods and it also uses other qualitative methods for both data collection (individual interviews, focus groups, observations) and data analysis to empirically investigate the theoretical background. The primary method of data collection was video-taped interviews.Â  This research consisted of a purposive sample of 228 individuals.",899809006,,Dissertations & Theses," Gonzalez-Perez, M.A.Gonzalez-PerezM.A.Gonzalez-Perez, M.A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491407291 , 65082241 , 101309 , U519465 , U519465", Dissertation/Thesis, 2008,, English, English,,2008,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2008,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899809006?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations,, 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," (UMI)AAIU519465 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+responsibility+networks+in+the+banana+industry%3A+the+role+of+corporate+social+responsibility+and+the+international+civil+society+in+improving+working+and+living+conditions+in+the+banana+industry.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2008-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gonzalez-Perez%2C+M.A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"On the Modernization of Law of Obligations,"Modernization has been a stirring topic all the time. In the modern society, there emerge so many new phenomenons as the information symbolized by computer network, the global harmonisation of economy, the development of life sciences and heredity sciences and medical technique, the universal of protection for consumers, and the diversification of living form. For these tremendous transformations, the civil law as the basic law regulating social life has to make its transformation, in which course law of obligations stands in the breach. This article makes study on some basic issues of the modernization of law of obligations from four parts as following: The first part is about the basic theories of the modernization of law of obligations. From the view of the article, the modernization of law of obligations in the first place is a process of ceaseless evolution, and should accord with the common rule about the evolution. So, the Marxist idea on the development of civil law constitutes the essential thought of the modernization of law of obligations, and determines the directions of the study by this article. On the ground of the Marxist idea on the development of civil law, there are three factors motivating the modernization of law of obligations: One is the transforming of legal philosophy from traditional legal philosophy symbolized by individualism and positivism to modern movement of free law. The second is the formation and development of modern civil society, the elementary characters of which as marketability, information, global harmonisation and such decide the fundamental trend of the modernization of law of obligations. As the legal basis, the third factor is the traditional law of obligations symbolized by the French Civil Law Code and the Germany Civil Law Code. Since the modern civil society, the traditional law of obligations has commenced its modernization through prejudication, doctrine, or special legislation. On 1980th, many nations such as Holland, Deutschland, Russia, and Korea started to concentrate and consolidate the fruit of the modernization through the form of codification. In part 2, the article firstly analyzes the goal of the modernization, and thinks the goal should be to make the modern law of obligations accommodated to modern social life. Then, the article suggests the modernity characters from macroscopical view. First character is the humanism of modern law of obligation, that is to say, the modern law of obligation being convinced of the theory about isolated human, endeavors to provide puny colonies for special safeguard. The second character is the trend of rationally codification of law of obligations. This means that, the modern law of obligations has been convinced of absolute perfect of code, and pursues rationally codification on the turn of century over again. The rationality represents on two aspects as following: to make the law outside code regress code, and to establish judicature free judgment. The third character is the trend of global harmonisation of modern law of obligation. Being a scientific system, Law of obligation surely has the common rules, which offer the possibilities of global harmonisation. Further to say, the humans survived from the twice World Wars and economy crisis thirst for peace and develop, that also constitutes the possibilities. The fourth character is the trend of actualization. That is to say, modern law of obligation should be up to date of time, and provide in time for proper regulation on newly social relationship. From microcosmic level, the modernization of law of obligations fastens on the modernization of the force effect system. Its ground and the positive effect and the limited effect compose the force effect of obligation. That is the main content in part 3. Firstly, after analyzing the modern develop of principles of freedom of contract and good faith, the article thinks that, the ground of modern law of obligations has been made the move from idea to reliance. Secondly, the modern law of obligations makes further sure of the positive effects, and that represents on such aspects as: the station of special performance has been descended while the idea of perform priority has been established; the obligations has been expanded its scope and formed the network of obligations; the scope of subject involved by the effects of obligations has also been boarded; and the privity of obligations has been breached by contracts involved by third parts. Thirdly, modern law of obligations has the trend to confirm the principle of circumstances change, and to broaden the qualification of discharge by law. Finally, as the core of law of obligations, the system of non-performance has makes its modernization in following ways: on the starting point of newly obligations, to form newly form of non-performance; to abolish traditional blemish liability and to found uniform breach of obligations. Part 4 is about the issues of the modernization of law of obligations in China. For the beginning, the article analyzes the civil society grounds of the modernization of law of obligations in China, and suggests that, along with the global harmonization and the develop of Marketing System since 1979, the modern civil society bearing similar characters with Western society has been come forth, so the social development has put the impetus and condition of the modernization of law of obligations in China.

Its membership was drawn from many different countries and included some of the most prominent progressive educators of that period. By 1945, however, the movement was experiencing international decline. Membership had fallen and in many countries the new educational network had ceased to exist. This situation was a result not only of the destruction of the new educational network in Europe during the Second World War, but also of the change in the outlook of educationists and reformers who sought new solutions to the problems of the reconstruction of society and education. The purpose of this study is to explore the NEF's importance as a disseminator of educational and political ideals after 1945 and its contribution to debates about the post-war reconstruction of education and society, using the considerable but currently little-researched material held at the Institute of Education, University of London. This thesis examines the NEF's network after 1945 and considers how far the NEF successfully extended its membership amongst school teachers and educationists at teacher training colleges. The NEF also sought to develop an international network. The international activities of the NEF, both through links with other organisations, for example, the United Nations Educational, Social and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO), and its membership in those countries where the NEF maintained branches are explored in order to gauge the success of the NEF as a movement with internationalist ambitions.",1774214000,,Dissertations & Theses," Clews, ChristopherClewsChristopherClews, Christopher",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989193701 , 102696032 , 101309 , 10019927 , 10019927 , http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/20592/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774214000?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/20592/ , (UMI)AAI10019927 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+new+education+fellowship+and+the+reconstruction+of+education%2C+1945+to+1966&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clews%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Daisaku ikeda's philosophy of peace: human revolution, dialogue and global civilization","Daisaku Ikeda is the Buddhist leader of one of the most visible religious movements today, the Soka Gakkai International (SGI). In this thesis, the main research question concerns the peace philosophy of Ikeda and its contribution to peace theory. Daisaku Ikeda and the SGI have been the subject of several scholarly studies in the fields of religious history and sociology. The focus of this research is on the significance of Ikeda's contributions in the field of peace studies, where his work has not yet been the subject of systematic investigation. It is argued that the originality of Ikeda's philosophy of peace resides in two main elements. First, the starting point is consistently human life and its potential for peace and happiness, not the omnipresence of conflict. Second, he offers a coherent system linking the individual, dialogical and global levels, which can be represented as a triangle made of three conceptual frameworks, that of Humanistic Psychology (Human Revolution), Communicative Rationality (Dialogue) and Cosmopolitan Democracy (Global Civilization). It is also argued that while being inspired by Ikeda's Buddhist spirituality and his loyalty to his mentor Josei Toda, this secular humanist approach to peace offers an effective and original way for all people to participate in the construction of a better world, regardless of their religious or ideological affiliation, social background or cultural practices.",1774836209,,Dissertations & Theses," Urbain, OlivierUrbainOlivierUrbain, Olivier",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3992810301 , 103107642 , 101309 , 10041415 , 10041415 , http://hdl.handle.net/10454/3354", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774836209?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/10454/3354 , (UMI)AAI10041415 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Daisaku+ikeda%27s+philosophy+of+peace%3A+human+revolution%2C+dialogue+and+global+civilization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Urbain%2C+Olivier&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A critical analysis of the open educational resources (oer) movement in the higher education sector in sub-saharan africa,"This study critically analysed three Open Educational Resources (OER) initiatives in Sub-Saharan Africa to help establish: What were the origins of the OER Movement?  How has it evolved?  What was the current state of the OER Movement a) globally; and b) in Sub-Saharan Africa? What were the key emerging issues facing the OER Movement generally and did these issues find commonality in the Sub-Saharan African OER Movement? What was the role of the OER Movement in supporting the Higher Education sector in Sub-Saharan Africa? In order to effectively decode the OER phenomenon – through the lens of three case studies – this research adopted qualitative research methods since these better enabled the researcher to understand, analyse and report the social and cultural contexts within which the OER initiatives were being implemented. The key findings of the research support the view that a shift in thinking is required in the way Higher Education is provided in Sub-Saharan Africa and that elements of the global OER Movement may be able to catalyse this shift. Further, this will need to be supported by adequate planning and resource provision, without which the ability of countries, institutions, educators and, indeed, the learners themselves, to benefit from OER strategies, will be severely curtailed. This stud also suggests that there is a need for further research into OER creation, organisation, dissemination and use that ideally, emanates from the African HEIs themselves, and which analytically describe and evaluates good practice for OER in Sub-Saharan Africa. Finally, the study suggests that the identification and inclusion of the key stakeholders who would participate in the development of an African OER Network focused on Higher Education and Training might be an effective starting point.",1783040240,,Dissertations & Theses," Bateman, Peter ThomasBatemanThomasPeterBateman, Peter Thomas",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4005064031 , 103450392 , 101309 , U580587 , U580587", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1783040240?accountid=14496, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, 0515 Education, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0515 Education, Education," (UMI)AAIU580587 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+critical+analysis+of+the+open+educational+resources+%28oer%29+movement+in+the+higher+education+sector+in+sub-saharan+africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bateman%2C+Peter+Thomas&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A study of conflict and its resolution between political contract and executive contract of modern government,"Translation from original language as provided by author This dissertation centering the conflict and its resolution between political government and executive government contract, analyzes modern government basic system and paradoxical movement, providing important reference to modern government, especially to provide reference for developing states in building modern government system and operation.Chapter 1: The thought of modern government contract.

Traditional Chinese culture contains abundant resources and wisdom of harmony, especially the basic characteristics and spirit of interpenetrating the five elements of yin and yang, holding in esteem the harmony of man and heaven, modeling on Zhonghe (meaning to attain a highly harmonious state) and the doctrine of the mean and attaching importance to self discipline and self morality cultivation, which has been cultivated under a derivative background with the main character of relatively closed geographical environment, agriculture-based economy, Isomorphic State-Family society pattern and multi- amalgamation of cultures. All the above can be a thinking and cultural support for the construction of harmonious society in contemporary China. The three relations, namely, Tianhe, Renhe and Xinhe, constitute the main contents of the traditional Chinese culture of harmony, and endow traditional harmony culture with a unique philosophical implication as well. By exploring the harmonious relationship between man and nature, Tianhe focuses on the harmonious intergrowth and development of man and nature; by revealing the harmonious relationship between man and society, Renhe majorly illustrates the harmonious coexistence of man and society; and by exploring the harmonious relationship between man and himself, Xinhe interprets the spiritual harmony in one's innermost. The logical extension from Xinhe (spiritual harmony) to Renhe (harmony of man and society) and Tianhe (harmony of man and nature) presents the philosophical path of the pursuit of universal harmony by traditional Chinese culture of harmony. The depression of traditional Chinese culture of harmony in modern times has a complicated and profound social and historical background. Traditional Chinese culture, the so-called invincible elephant who despised the Western Barbarians, was dismembered into pieces by the rising of western learning in the New Culture Movement, only to search for a desolated corner to survive, and basically lose the leading discourse power in Chinese ideology. However, the harmonious spirit and living wisdom involved in it still have a unique value on mending the gap on combination of heaven and man, tamping the base of justice and fairness, adjusting the moral standards, and building a home for mental settlement and a bridge for global harmony. Chinese traditional culture and contemporary culture are totally different in social and historical background, and facing totally different problems. To realize the contemporary value of traditional Chinese culture of harmony, the contemporary conversion of it must be conducted. In terms of the essence of it, the Chinese culture of harmony should be re-constructed on the basis of making full use of the valuable thinking sources of traditional culture of harmony. It should be noted that in reconstructing Chinese culture of harmony the relationships between scientific and historical reality, inheritance and innovation, nationality and cosmopolitan, leading goal and diversity must be recognized and grasped, with an orientation of establishing new reference system for eco-civilization, expanding a new space for public fields and building a new home for mental balance. In this case, in the course of constructing contemporary harmonious society, the western world will be fascinated by the glory and brilliance of traditional Chinese culture of harmony once",1870003914,,Dissertations & Theses," Wu, Tian ZhiWuZhiTianWu, Tian Zhi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315673891 , 111136992 , 189128 , 10455114 , 10455114", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870003914?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," (UMI)AAI10455114 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Concept+of+harmony+of+the+traditional+chinese+culture+ken+and+its+contemporary+conversion&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wu%2C+Tian+Zhi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Research for the role of japanese ngos in the sino-japanese relations,"Translation from original language as provided by author After World War II, Japanese NGOs have developed gradually in the public campaign of war aiding overseas, refugee relief, and domestic environmental protection, anti-war movement, etc. and flourished with the rapid economic growth.

Heavy losses as the 2008 financial tsunami have bought to domestic service trade: it is by all means a central concern nation-wide; therefore, we might conclude that, the position on which the service industry of a country stands may decide, to a certain extent, how faraway the country's economy can go. By studying the current situation of tourism, transport and finance, this paper intends to justify the existence of barriers in service trade and expatiate on its implication, classification, and characteristics; it can be concluded on these researches that nowadays barriers are omnipresent in service trade and they are taking effects for more covert purposes, in more flexible manner, under more dynamic forms and with more extensive connections. Barriers to trade in services would undoubtedly reduce export volume, deteriorate terms of trade for exporting countries and lowering the level of social welfare. In China, exporting services such as tourism, transport, etc are inclined to be influenced by the mode of ""commercial presence"" and ""movement of Personnel"". Besides, restrictive barriers set for foreign providers would decrease the supply of certain products and inevitably bring in Monopoly profits; such examples can be found in finance where foreign participants suffer from barriers like ""market access"" and ""national treatment"". As far as service trade powers are concerned, especially if it is a developing country, any barrier set against service trade will cut down the volume of imported services and bring losses to net profit; therefore, here comes before us the question: what are the effective and practical strategies to adopt in international trade? Making full use of the GATS in order to cope with all sorts of barriers and meanwhile opening a favorably protective market are issues of both theoretical and practical significances to the development of service trade in",1870411745,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, LingLiLingLi, Ling",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4316313381 , 111186152 , 189128 , 10468252 , 10468252", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, Chinese, Chinese,,2009,PQDT - Global,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870411745?accountid=14496, 0505 Economics, 0505 Economics, 0505 Economics,, 0505 Economics, Economics," (UMI)AAI10468252 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Analysis+on+barriers+to+trade+in+services+and+the+development+of+services+trade+in+china&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Ling&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Performance valuation of commercial banks and related investment strategies-a dea approach,"Translation from original language as provided by author Banks are the essential support of the finance activity. The improvement of bank efficiency is conducive to enhancing the efficiency of the use of social capital. With the deepening of global integration, more and more foreign banks join the game. To maintain the independence of our financial system, we must improve our banks' competiveness, and efficiency means competiveness, at some times. Public commercial banks play a very important role in banking industry; they stand for the frontier of the banking industry. So we choose Chinese public commercial banks as our sample. All of our research based on Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), first section, we do some research on banks' performance, reference to previous studies, we focus on who will use the results, and create social product efficiency, services efficiency, profit efficiency, and growth efficiency. It's the first time we use salary as an input variable. From different angles, we provide a comprehensive objective assessment. And then do some regression analysis on efficiency and corporation structure, asset percentage, location, and so on. At the same time, we do some research on the relation of stocks return and efficiency score; based on the efficiency score we construct a banking industry portfolio and get super return.

Because of the lessons that German, Italian and Japanese fascist state used monopoly news to make media war and fool people, in order to maintain the continued cooperation between the Allies to prevent the use of distorting the news for the authoritarian rule or power service, people of all countries need to understand the true World War II situation and enhance exchanges of the feelings among people, the slogan ""the international freedom of the press,"" produced for the needs of the times. First of all, the slogan raised by the U.S. media, quickly formed a global campaign of freedom of the press. According to international freedom of the press is freedom of speech and basic human rights are universal. Its meaning is to prevent abuse of government power, violations of freedom of the press and for the full realization of freedom of expression. In order to obtain the leadership of freedom of the press in the international movement's, the press of United States advocate the freedom of the press all over the world.

At that time the press had a great social impact in China.

The "" press freedom campaign"" of the 1940s is an important part of the struggle of China's modern history of the freedom of the press.

We must balance urban and rural economic and social development to solve the ""three rural issue"", to achieve a harmonious socialist society and to achieve overall well-off. It's stated in the 17th Party Congress that ""balance urban and rural development and build a new socialist countryside.""

Therefore, Balance urban and rural development, we must reform the existing household registration management system, breaking the durance to freedom of movement and freedom to settle, setting the integration of a unified urban and rural household registration management system, eliminating the division of agricultural population and non-agricultural population, giving the same rights as urban and rural residents, while also abolish the residence attached to the different interests on the distribution system, giving equal rights to each citizen in education, social security, employment, eliminating the administrative barriers of rural-urban transfer. Only in this way, we can greatly improve the level of urbanization, develop the modern agriculture, solve the ""three rural"" issue, promote the rural surplus labor force and increase the income of the farmers, improve the rural-urban transfer promote urban and rural co-coordinated development.

Fashion is often associated with France, the United States, the United Kingdom or Italy as world fashion landmarks, and Australia is obviously down on the ladder. However in the era of globalization, Australia's position is escalating in the fashion arena, and the Australian women have made achievements to mould and develop their identity by the means of fashion. Early Australian women were just like women in most of the rest of the world at that time, suffering from lack of independence and equal rights. Their inferior position led to the way they were dressed in accordance with social norms and presuppositions. The enduring torture and pain coming from the then fashion regulations and control gradually turned the obedient Australian women into rebellious minds. Moreover, the big waves of feminist movements have accelerated the process of awakening women's awareness to fight for their own rights. With the many other favorable forces playing together, Australian women have thus made tremendous achievements in changing the label of Australian fashion from the display of a forced and controlled aesthetic value to the symbol of choices of freedom and the showcase of their life attitude. Fashion has then broken out of the chains to be lighter, simpler and diversified. It took Australian women over a century to break out of the male defined femininity rules, and in the meantime, they have been trying to search out for their own Australian identity of fashion to set the difference from the ubiquitous international fashion styles. As a result, Australian fashion is now featured with thongs, beachwear and bright colors. This thesis is aimed to present a clear picture of the characteristics of Australian fashion at different stages under the influence of the revolutions that have occurred among Australian women and also demonstrates how Australian women's increasing efforts and involvement exert the great influence on the development of Australian fashion and the significance of Australian women to the global",1874526593,,Dissertations & Theses," Jiang, Jun YanJiangYanJunJiang, Jun Yan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

It was advantageous to consolidate the movement achievement. Concluding remarks summarized the affirmation and negative of the movement, that is the positive effects and negative impacts. On this basis, the author pointed out that in the period of socialist construction, it is not desirable to rely on political campaigns to solve social issues.

As an example of this phenomenon, this dissertation presents an ethnographic study of a non-profit women's organization by the name of Al-Huda International that has had unprecedented success in bringing urban Pakistani Muslim women toward studying the Qur'an and its tafsir (contextual explanation). Leaders of this group have mobilized a movement that has had had a profound impact on how urban middle and upper class women are beginning to relate to religious texts. Such engagement has generated new understandings of self-hood and moral agency amongst members of this group, who have taken it upon themselves to reform their public and private lives to bring them in line with their new found learning of Islam. Through excavating stories of women who are students and teachers at Al-Huda in Pakistan, as well as prominent actors who have been the most vocal critics of this organization, my dissertation explores how expressions of these new religious subjectivities are posing a challenge to feminist and secular frameworks for social change. In 2005, the leader of this organization - Dr. Farhat Hashmi - migrated to Canada to set up a branch of Al-Huda in Mississauga, Ontario, which is home to a large population of South Asian Muslims. The almost instant success of the organization in Mississauga has, in turn, generated a series of questions and a sense of near panic amongst both Muslim and non-Muslim Canadians alike. In the second portion of my dissertation I explore how members of this group are coming into visibility as racialized and gendered subjects within overlapping discourses on multiculturalism, national security, and religious difference in contemporary Canadian society. My dissertation forges a linked transnational analysis of Al-Huda to highlight the production and reception of new religious subjectivities of Pakistani Muslim women.",250916646,,Dissertations & Theses," Shaikh, KhanumShaikhKhanumShaikh, Khanum",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1998391871 , 51483031 , 66569 , 9781109687101 , 3401629 , 3401629", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109687101, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/250916646?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Womens studies , Islamic Studies , South Asian Studies , Religion , Muslims , Nonprofit organizations , Pakistan"," Social sciences , Al-Huda International , Gender , Islam , Pakistan , Religious movements , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=New+expressions+of+religiosity%3A+A+transnational+study+of+Al+-Huda+International&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shaikh%2C+Khanum&amp;isbn=9781109687101&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Mandatory development: The political economy of the French mandate in Syria and Lebanon, 1915–1939","Following the collapse of the Ottoman Empire at the end of World War One, France ruled Lebanon and Syria on behalf of the League of Nations as an ‘A’ mandate until 1946. The French administration was supposed to facilitate the creation of constitutions, parliaments, social infrastructure and legal systems for the mandate territories. But Lebanon and Syria also became part of a French colonial empire then at its apogee, informed by assumptions of French superiority, but enfeebled by the Great War, and reliant on military coercion, legal and social differentiation and economic exploitation. This dissertation explores the political economy of French rule in the mandate. Based on extensive archival research, the study examines the tensions between French imperial and mandatory agendas, notably their aim to improve and profit from the economic resources of the mandate zones, and the goals and aspirations of Syro-Lebanese constituencies. Initially, I explore the ideas and plans for the post-World War One empire publicized by French colonialists, and examine how they assessed the economic potential of Syria and Lebanon, drawing as they did so on cultural typologies. I also ask how Syro-Lebanese groups tried to appropriate such ideas in the fluid period at the end of the war. Next, I examine the politics of utility concessions in Lebanon and Syria during the 1920s and 1930s, explaining how Syro-Lebanese protested the French approach to economic development through boycott movements. Although nationalist and class politics featured in such movements, the boycotts remained protean, and accomodated Syro-Lebanese reformists with limited ameliorative agendas. A further chapter on trade fairs examines the dynamics of another arena of protest large enough to accomodate numerous positions on the politics of the economy. Finally, I ask how the Syro-Lebanese diaspora around the world worked, through the League of Nations in particular, to influence and protest economic policy in the mandate. Through this transnational mode of analysis, and more broadly by concentrating on political-economic questions, rooted in the details of infrastructure concessions, this study departs from the standard concentration in the existing historiography, which has focussed on politics and sectarianism to a restrictive degree.",276046290,,Dissertations & Theses," Jackson, Simon M.W.JacksonM.W.SimonJackson, Simon M.W.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757065131 , 44497501 , 66569 , 9781109902655 , 3342401 , 3342401", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109902655, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/276046290?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," Middle Eastern history , European history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Development , Empire , France , Lebanon , Mandate , Political economy , Syria",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mandatory+development%3A+The+political+economy+of+the+French%0Amandate+in+Syria+and+Lebanon%2C+1915%E2%80%931939&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jackson%2C+Simon+M.W.&amp;isbn=9781109902655&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A Space for living: Region and nature in the San Francisco Bay Area, 1939-1969","In the decades around World War II, the San Francisco Bay Area in Northern California rapidly evolved into a more complex urban region. A diverse group of architects, landscape architects, and urban planners recognized the social and environmental issues inherent in this regional city. Their vision to combine modernist design with regional inspirations from nature, enacted at the regional scale, gave birth to an “arc of regional modernism” in mid-century American urbanism and architecture. This vision of regional modernism arose in the 1930s when a group of architects and landscape architects combined ideas from the Modern Movement with inspirations from Bay Area natural landscapes. Often viewed as a unique contrast to the International Style, their philosophy of environmental design was instead an integral part of a modernist architecture more varied than typically understood. The architecture and urban planning group Telesis presented a vision of urban regional growth—inspired by both Lewis Mumford and CIAM—that included modernist urban renewal and regional urban growth control. Telesis laid the foundations for the Bay Area’s legacy in both urban renewal and the natural open space preservation of the greenbelt. The Safeway Corporation’s evolving designs for the postwar supermarket demonstrate how one grocery store chain used modern architecture to promote an image of the modern corporation and then used regionalist architectural motifs to obscure the realities of large-scale food distribution. Better understood as regional modernists, women such as Catherine Bauer Wurster, Dorothy Erskine, Geraldine Knight Scott, and Elizabeth Mock played a substantial role in supporting and tempering the spread of modernism while demonstrating the importance of women in some of environmentalism most significant urban accomplishments. A case study of Bauer presents her history in environmental conservation and regional planning. Finally, the events at People’s Park in Berkeley in 1969 demonstrate the decline of the arc of regional modernism. Two visions of incorporating nature into the urban fabric collided when the top-down planning vision of regional modernism clashed with the efforts of young designers to create a more collaborative, community-based movement in architecture and planning.",304693867,,Dissertations & Theses," Allen, Peter AlbertAllenAlbertPeterAllen, Peter Albert",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2037898721 , 48376181 , 66569 , 9781109749328 , 3402587 , 3402587", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109749328, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304693867?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning",," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," Art history , Architecture , Urban planning"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Environmental history , Modern architecture , Regionalism , San Francisco , Urban history , Urban planning",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Space+for+living%3A+Region+and+nature+in+the+San+Francisco%0ABay+Area%2C+1939-1969&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Allen%2C+Peter+Albert&amp;isbn=9781109749328&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Getting krump: Reading choreographies of cultural desire through an Afro -diasporic dance,"This dissertation explores the diasporic travel of the dance form, krump, which, since its origins in South Central Los Angeles, California in 2000, has become something of a global phenomenon. Specifically, it addresses the way the dance has achieved a kind of cultural capital through its appearance in such places as the documentary film Rize (2005), music videos, Hollywood movies, television shows; in cyberspace on You Tube, various krumping websites and chat rooms; and in widely distributed how-to-videos. As krump has moved from a relatively local and marginalized practice found in Los Angeles to global spaces, through popular culture, different groups and individuals have mobilized it, for specific purposes. Throughout call-and-response is utilized as a theoretical lens that illuminates krump in relation to the dynamic structures of space, place, power, politics, and the market, as well as its modes of use and efficacy related to individual healing and social medicine in specific examples. How various Africanist aesthetics of krump are racialized, gendered, classed, and sexualized changes with the contexts in which it is practiced, for what purposes, and by whom, as well as with who is ""reading"" the practice. My approach embraces the ""audacity of hope,"" inspired by the ingenuity of the dancers. However in this embrace, the registers of power remain in full view so that they don't get lost in a celebration of ingenuity that forgets why the ingenuity is necessary in the first place. Theoretical frameworks include Paul Gilroy's charge, to see culture as a relational strategy that reveals our radical planetary humanity, embodied knowledge as it relates to cultural transfer, Deleuze and Guattari's rhizome, Dixon Gottschild's articulations of Africanist aesthetics, Fukiau's notions of healing, and Yvonne Daniel's proposal of dance as social medicine and Jill Dolan's utopian performative. Its contribution is to read krump—through both its movement aesthetics and the various paths of its cultural mobilization—as an example of dance as a political expression of both presence (for the marginalized communities from which it emerged) and desire (among those who take up the practice).",304827766,,Dissertations & Theses," Todd, Megan AnneToddAnneMeganTodd, Megan Anne",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1790314191 , 46845091 , 66569 , 9781109147193 , 3357286 , 3357286", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109147193, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304827766?accountid=14496," 0378 Dance , 0465 Theater , 0708 Mass communications"," 0378 Dance , 0465 Theater , 0708 Mass communications"," 0378 Dance , 0465 Theater , 0708 Mass communications",," 0378 Dance , 0465 Theater , 0708 Mass communications"," Dance , Theater , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Afro-diasporic dance , Cultural studies , Dance , Krump , Popular culture , Social medicine",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Getting+krump%3A+Reading+choreographies+of+cultural+desire+through+an+Afro+-diasporic+dance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Todd%2C+Megan+Anne&amp;isbn=9781109147193&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Uprooted lives: Development, disparity, and south-south migration in Costa Rica's export agriculture","Over half of the international migrants in the world migrate from one country in the global south to another, and the great majority of them cross a contiguous border. The predominant theoretical frameworks used to explain international migration dynamics stem from south-north migration studies and fail to fully address migration occurring in the global south. This dissertation explores the case of Nicaraguan migration into Costa Rica's export agriculture sector and how neoliberal economic policies affect the lived experiences of agrarian people. Using in-depth interviews, participant observation, and community surveys in the home and destination countries, it privileges the perspective of the migrant worker to understand migration initiation, integration, work, and the implications of migration for the families back home in a context of structural transformation. South-south migration dynamics are shown to be distinct from the explanatory frameworks born out of the south-north migration literature. This is due to differences in relevance about assumptions about structural stability and the formation and maintenance of protective institutions for migrants. In the case of south-south migrations, a relatively rapid structural transformation is the essence of economic development and rational-choice indicators, such as the size of earnings and remittances, become less illuminating. A social network approach is used to study migration of Nicaraguans into Costa Rica's rapidly expanding export agriculture sector in the context of neoliberal reform. This analysis focuses on migrant relationships, why they operate as they do, and how they change over time, and with what consequences. Migrants' vulnerability has led to the formation of relationships that diminish risk for the migrants, but not necessarily for families. These relationships differ by gender and the opportunities that individuals have in the both the sending and destination countries. The chapters in this dissertation follow Nicaraguan migrants working in the agriculture sector in Costa Rica while embedding their movements in shared southern context of neoliberal reform in the agriculture sector.",304836558,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, Sang EunLeeEunSangLee, Sang Eun",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1905055161 , 49406421 , 66569 , 9781109457636 , 3383274 , 3383274", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109457636, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304836558?accountid=14496," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Agricultural economics , Sociology , Ethnic studies , Studies , Exports"," Social sciences , Agricultural labor , Costa Rica , Export agriculture , International development , International migration , Latin America , Migrant labor , Nicaragua",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Uprooted+lives%3A+Development%2C+disparity%2C+and+south-south+migration+in+Costa+Rica%27s+export+agriculture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Sang+Eun&amp;isbn=9781109457636&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Neighborly governance: Neighborhood associations and participative democracy in Tucson, Arizona","This dissertation examines contemporary changes in relations and forms of urban governance by focusing on neighborhood associations in Tucson and analyzing their practices and experiences in the midst of an emerging trend that values collective action and direct democracy. This urban ethnography focuses on practices, strategies, and ideologies of neighborhood associations to discuss issues of representation, participation, and social integration. This dissertation is based on fieldwork conducted for a total of 24 months between 2005 and 2007. It combines participant observation and in-depth interviews with Tucson residents, members of neighborhood associations, and City and non-governmental organizations’ officials. This work is presented in three main parts divided into several chapters. In the first part, I provide a general review of the development of concepts of governance and representative democracy in contemporary as well as earlier times. I aim to contextualize the work of neighborhood associations within a general movement towards more direct participatory democracy and argue that a new understanding of the transformations impacting the functioning of representative democracy is crucial to its preservation as a central institution of social integration. The second part of this dissertation presents an analysis of fieldwork data and argues that neighborhood associations are positioning themselves, at the local and global levels, as an important part of the emerging discourses and practices of civil society. Within this broad context, neighborhood associations engage in a variety of activities, pursue multiple strategies, and adopt very different ideologies. A central idea that results from this analysis is that neighborhood associations greatly value practices of direct democracy and strive to exercise greater control over processes of representative democracy in order to prevent its perceived deficiencies from thwarting their projects and corrupting their ideals. The third part extends the data analysis and provides a political and historical reconstruction of neighborhood associations and their cultural evolution as a continuation of the counterculture movement of the 1960s. I also argue that there is a powerful drive towards the global implementation and exercise of direct democratic processes. I draw on the example of Morocco’s urban governance reforms and discuss its growing neighborhood associations to show the delicate and conflicted paths they tread between their engagement with the existing system of representative democracy and their attempts to step beyond the limitations of that system to carry out some of the ideals of building a direct and participatory urban democracy.",304843037,,Dissertations & Theses," Mjahed, MouradMjahedMouradMjahed, Mourad",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1857284111 , 43443391 , 66569 , 9781109309171 , 3369108 , 3369108", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109309171, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304843037?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Arizona , Civil society , Community organizing , Democracy , Neighborhood associations , Participative democracy , Social integration , Tucson , Urban governance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Neighborly+governance%3A+Neighborhood+associations+and+participative+democracy+in+Tucson%2C+Arizona&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mjahed%2C+Mourad&amp;isbn=9781109309171&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""&lt;i&gt;Ubuntu&lt;/i&gt;: Globalization, accommodation, and contestation in South Africa","Following the end of constitutional apartheid, indigenous perspectives and practices have gained prominence in South Africa. This dissertation examines the promise of the indigenous philosophy of ubuntu and asks how and why this worldview has emerged as one of the most important keywords in the new postcolony. It outlines the role of ubuntu in the transition from apartheid and explores what it may reveal about the shifting power relations in the shadow of neoliberal globalization conditions. While there is a growing body of literature on the philosophical aspects of ubuntu, there is a dearth of detailed empirical research that connects its multiple uses to the social, political, and economic relations in the country. In exploring the potential of ubuntu in shaping the future of a democratic South Africa, the dissertation brings to the fore the voices of community organizations and individual activists. A combination of qualitative methods was used; primarily ethnographic field research in Clermont, a township on the outskirts of Durban. In addition to participating in the activities of community groups, the research benefited from unstructured interviews of leaders and representatives of 23 community organizations and non-governmental organizations in the township. Interviews of ubuntu -oriented international actors underscored a key point: the resurgence of ubuntu in South Africa is not an isolated local phenomenon and it has significance for understanding similar global phenomena. The research findings reveal that despite decades of subjugation under colonial rule, indigenous knowledges and practices thrived and continue to be relevant in the new postcolony. While it is important to pose the question, ""What is ubuntu ?"" the dissertation follows a more sociological approach that asks: ""Who speaks of ubuntu ? And to what end?"" To answer these questions, the study borrows conceptual tools from indigenous knowledge literature, globalization studies, and Karl Polanyi's notion of the double-movement theorem. The sociological approach adopted here demonstrates that the resurgence of ubuntu does not represent mere postmodern articulations of identity politics (or so-called ""invented traditions""). Rather, it marks the production of new forms of consciousness and the expression of discontent with (post)modernity.",304843631,,Dissertations & Theses," Ngcoya, MvuseleloNgcoyaMvuseleloNgcoya, Mvuselelo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1793295211 , 43787191 , 66569 , 9781109151237 , 3357498 , 3357498", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109151237, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304843631?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure"," Political science , International law , Globalization , Social structure , South Africa"," Social sciences , Accommodation , Contestation , Culture , Globalization , Indigenous knowledge , Resistance , South Africa , Ubuntu",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ubuntu%3A+Globalization%2C+accommodation%2C+and+contestation+in+South+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ngcoya%2C+Mvuselelo&amp;isbn=9781109151237&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"This world and the next: The interrelationships of religion and development,"Classical social theorists such as Marx, Weber, and Durkheim all predicted that modern society would inevitably secularize and that religion's role in the modern world would diminish. Following these classical theorists, development studies—starting with the early modernization theorists—viewed development and secularization as inextricably going hand in hand as part of a universal march towards progress and material abundance. In contradiction to these assumptions, however, religion has not disappeared from the world. In fact, a revival of religion is afoot in many countries. This is not simply a revival of individual religious belief, but of the public role of religion in shaping modern politics, public policy, and social welfare. The central argument of this dissertation is posed against the assumption that development is the progression of society that occurs once the yoke of religion has been thrown off, and modern, secular, material progress is obtained through natural and economic science. Rather this dissertation argues that religion and spirituality are intricately interrelated to development in many societies both in terms of shaping understandings of what development is, as well as, how development is undertaken. The chapters of this dissertation provide examples from across the world of how religion and development are interrelated at every level of human society from the transformation of individual consciousness, to civil society organizations, to the state, to economic systems, to global social movements. This dissertation draws on 200 interviews conducted in 9 countries across Asia, Africa, and Latin America. Respondents were representatives of 155 secular and religious development organizations including, non-governmental organizations, faith-based development organizations, government departments, development policy agencies, multilateral development institutions, religious congregations with development projects, business alliances, and social movement organizations. Respondents were selected to represent as large a range as possible of both religious and secular organizations. The 200 interviews were analyzed interpretively to assess both the way that religious organizations and institutions are engaged in development, as well as the subjective meanings through which different people in a broad range of secular and religious development organizations understand development.",304847167,,Dissertations & Theses," Noy, DarrenNoyDarrenNoy, Darren",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1905132581 , 49570921 , 66569 , 9781109457094 , 3383351 , 3383351", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109457094, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304847167?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0700 Social structure"," 0318 Religion , 0700 Social structure",," 0318 Religion , 0700 Social structure"," Religion , Social structure"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Development , Religion , Secularization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=This+world+and+the+next%3A+The+interrelationships+of+religion+and+development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Noy%2C+Darren&amp;isbn=9781109457094&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Creative corporatism: Institutional innovation and high -technology competition in Northern Europe,"My dissertation documents and explains the ability of European economies to compete in rapid, innovation-based, high-technology industries. The literature on comparative political economy is quite pessimistic about the capacity of European economies to compete in this space. Neo-liberal critics contend that rigid, ""neo-corporatist"" bargains among state, industry and labor representatives delay the flexible redistribution of resources. Even supporters of corporatism suggest that these economies compete primarily by incremental adjustment in established low- or medium-technology industries and cannot accommodate disruptive technological innovations. My dissertation challenges this characterization of European capitalism by arguing that neo-corporatism bargains can be adapted to facilitate high-technology competition. More specifically, I identify three different patterns of neo-corporatist bargaining and adjustment. Historically, scholars linked neo-corporatism to patient capital, generous social benefits and reactive industrial policies. This form of ""conservative corporatism"" mobilized resources around existing actors in stable, gradually evolving industries. More recent literature on ""competitive corporatism"" suggests that neo-corporatism can be adapted to perform different functions. This literature focuses on liberal objectives, such as fiscal retrenchment wage restraint and market-oriented social benefit reforms. I identify an alternative adaptation, ""creative corporatism,"" in which neo-corporatist economies engage state, industry and labor representatives in the construction of new, supply-side resources. By investing in risk capital, skill formation and research, stakeholders can facilitate movement into new, high-technology industries. My dissertation supports these claims by examining shifting patterns of institutionalized cooperation and high-technology competition in Finland, Denmark and Ireland. In Finland, a shift from conservative to creative corporatism helped the country assume global leadership in telecommunications equipment. Denmark relied on a similar shift to facilitate high-technology competition, although more decentralized cooperation supported a smaller and more diverse collection of activities. Finally, I contrast creative corporatism in Denmark and Finland to competitive corporatist strategies in Ireland. Ireland also leveraged neo-corporatism to move into new, high-technology industries, although bargaining privileged cost competition and movement relatively low-end assembly and service operations rather than research and development. Analysis is based on 253 interviews with politicians, policy-makers and industry representatives conducted between 2005 and 2006.",304850914,,Dissertations & Theses," Ornston, Darius ParkeOrnstonParkeDariusOrnston, Darius Parke",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1905138111 , 48375231 , 66569 , 9781109457216 , 3383359 , 3383359", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109457216, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304850914?accountid=14496," 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science"," 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science"," 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science",," 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science"," Economics , Political science , Studies , High tech industries"," Social sciences , Competition , Denmark , European politics , Finland , High-technology , Ireland , Neocorporatism , Political economy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Creative+corporatism%3A+Institutional+innovation+and+high+-technology+competition+in+Northern+Europe&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ornston%2C+Darius+Parke&amp;isbn=9781109457216&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Childhood, modernity, and nation-building in Egypt, 1890-1939","Historians agree that “childhood” is not an unchanging, natural phenomenon but is a social and cultural construct. This has been a much-debated topic in the history of Europe, particularly in France where scholars such as Philippe Ariès, founder of the field the history of childhood, have made strong arguments as to how to conceptualize historical changes in childhood in the West. While it is clear that the concept of childhood has changed over time, no historian has researched how it has changed in Egypt, or the Middle East more generally speaking. My dissertation explores how the concept of childhood changed in Egypt during the first half of the twentieth century. Some of the change was in response to and a part of the nationalist movement, the development of new social classes, and the expansion of state control over the family, as well as in reaction to a new sense of individual rights. Chapter one uses autobiographies of childhood by Egyptians who grew up during the first half of the twentieth-century to construct an ethnography of what it was like then to be an average Egyptian child. Chapter two uses intellectual discourse of the era to reveal that when reformers spoke of children as a means of change for the nation they were making claims for a change in the traditional concept of childhood. Chapter three shows that as the new concept of childhood developed in the first half of the twentieth-century, it required institutions to implement it, particularly children’s literature. Chapter four takes a close look at the dimensions of the Egyptian child which reformers, nationalists, and institutions sought to “make modern” for the sake of the nation. My dissertation’s use of a previously silenced source of historical actors (children) in Egyptian history offers a new understanding of: the nation-building project in Egyptian history; the evolution of the concept of childhood in a global context; and debates on the implementation of children’s rights today in the Middle East.",304853161,,Dissertations & Theses," Morrison, HeidiMorrisonHeidiMorrison, Heidi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1870649601 , 48766171 , 66569 , 9781109329766 , 3371667 , 3371667", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109329766, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304853161?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0628 Individual & family studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0628 Individual & family studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0628 Individual & family studies",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0628 Individual & family studies"," Middle Eastern history , Individual & family studies"," Social sciences , Childhood , Children's literature , Children's rights , Egypt , Modernity , Nationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Childhood%2C+modernity%2C+and+nation-building+in+Egypt%2C+1890-1939&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Morrison%2C+Heidi&amp;isbn=9781109329766&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"After labourism: The neoliberal turn by labor parties and the response by trade unions,"Explanations for the embrace of pro-market policies by social democratic parties over the last thirty years have pointed to various factors, most commonly the globalization of production and finance, the shrinking of the blue-collar working class, and the rise of socalled postmaterialist politics. The dominant theme in the literature is the transformation of these parties under the pressure of the global capitalist economy, which forces social democratic governments to implement benefit cuts, deregulate markets, and commercialize and privatize the public sector. Such accounts are insufficient because they do not take three important factors into account. The first factor is the change in the class composition of the leadership and individual membership of social democratic parties, even in labor parties with trade union affiliations (New Zealand, Britain, Australia). These parties are increasingly dominated by the salariat—a stratum of intermediate executives and technicians, professionals and engineers, all of whom enjoy a high degree of economic security, job autonomy, and education. The second factor is the diminishing of the influence of the unions within the very parties that are supposed to be their political representatives. The third factor is the lack of a strategy by the unions to ensure that the party leadership must listen to them and take their interests into account when formulating policies. This may be due to a longstanding lack of interest by the unions in engaging in politics (New Zealand) or a passivity by the unions which resulted from many years of anti-union Conservative rule (Britain). In the case of Australia under Labor Party governance (1983-1996) the unions were sufficiently united, disciplined and strategically minded to ensure that a Labor Party government would integrate them into the making of policy. The evidence suggests that the centralized organization of union federations makes the union movement appear as a credible force to labor party leaderships, and that to be able to moderate how quickly and how drastically labor party governments can enact neoliberal policies the unions must be politically active within their historic parties and offer a coherent economic program years before the parties take office.",304862571,,Dissertations & Theses," Schulman, JasonSchulmanJasonSchulman, Jason",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1680713801 , 42523471 , 66569 , 9781109052404 , 3349474 , 3349474", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109052404, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304862571?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Class , Labor , Labor parties , Neoliberalism , Salariat , Social democracy , Trade unions , Union",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=After+labourism%3A+The+neoliberal+turn+by+labor+parties+and+the+response+by+trade+unions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schulman%2C+Jason&amp;isbn=9781109052404&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The political ecology of environmental justice: Environmental struggle and injustice in the Yeongheung Island coal plant controversy,"From the perspective of environmental justice, the construction of the coal plant on Yeongheung Island in South Korea is environmentally unjust. Procedural justice has been completely ignored and excluded from the conflict between development and the environment. One important debate in environmental justice is about the realization of procedural and distributive justice. The most important factor toward the realization of environmental justice, has been distributive justice; as a result, procedural justice has not been considered an issue. Economic issues related to financial and educational support and compensation for the local residents by coal plant developers seems to mislead one to believe there is a realization of distributive environmental justice. However, the emphasis on distributive justice clearly shows procedural injustice. Without consideration of procedural justice, environmental justice can never be realized. In addition, a series of environmental symptoms such as coal dust, noise of power transmission towers, and destruction of tidelands means environmental injustice in that the region is composed of senior citizens and low-income residents. Environmental injustice is easily observed from most places where environmental problems occur, therefore it can be said to be a prevalent phenomenon. Therefore, simple observation of environmental injustice does not hold the key of the solution for the injustice. In other words, activists and academic analysts need a larger framework to explain a chain of processes of how environmental injustice is produced, reproduced, and manipulated. Political ecology is a useful framework to investigate environmental injustice. Political ecological framework functions to explain: (1) degradation and marginalization, (2) environmental conflict, (3) conservation and control, and (4) environmental identity and social movement (Robbins 2004). Those elements are all associated with what we call environmental justice. Environmental injustice is concerned with: (1) the marginalization of local residents from environmental discourses, (2) conflicts between developers and environmentalists and the exclusion of local residents, (3) the identity of local residents who are not able to conserve and control their own land, and (4) environmental movements that do not take into consideration local residents’ life. Therefore, the political ecological framework improves and enlarges the discussion of environmental justice from a larger social, political, and economic perspective. It uncovers the structures and relationships that underlay procedural injustice. In this respect, the political ecological framework helps to investigate the problems of environmental injustice and concealment of environmental injustice. Environmental injustice is observed everywhere environmental problems occur. In the study area, environmental injustice is evident because local residents are low-income farmers and fishermen and are the victims of potential environmental pollutions. The more important finding is the way environmental injustice is subtly hidden by: (1) unequal social relations, (2) neoliberal capitalism, and (3) the social construction of nature, environment and scales. As proven by the failure of the environmental movement that took place during the 1990s, the social relations between the different groups (environmentalists, developers, governments, and local residents) are unequal. The central government and developers tend to subvert the legal processes by adjusting existing policies and by manipulating consent form from local residents. This kind of environmental injustice suggests that procedural justice should be emphasized and that it has been relatively belittled in comparison with distributive justice. Neoliberal capitalism in a global context is another way of hiding environmental injustice. Neoliberalism is relevant in understanding economic crisis or depression. This is no exception in the case of coal energy in Korea. In the name of the free trade-stimulus between Korea and China, the utilization of cheap coal from China was no longer in doubt, regardless of environmental concerns. In this way, global capitalism and developmentalism justified coal as the preferred energy source. In addition, developers socially construct nature, environment and scale to hide environmental injustice. The project of developers for the breeding of short-neck clams and their manipulation of the plant’s environmental impact assessment are clear examples that demonstrate the social construction. These findings are measurable through the political ecological framework. In other words, understanding the conflict of the coal plant in the study area, which demonstrates localized environmental injustice, requires a political ecology approach that explains social relations, capitalism and social construction of nature and environment.

The PAAC presented concerts of new music from the Americas between 1928 and 1934 in New York City, Havana, and Europe. Purposeful diversity, or “collective difference,” was the PAAC’s strategy for approaching European audiences by collaborative force. The principle of collective difference describes both the stylistic diversity present on PAAC concerts and also the ultimate goal of that diversity, which was to reverse the flow of musical culture from west to east. Through social and cultural research, style analysis, and reception history, I demonstrate collective difference in the combinations of primitivist, nationalist, modernist, and neo-classical tendencies present in the PAAC repertory. In doing so, I reevaluate accepted nationalist discourses in the Americas from a transnational perspective and demonstrate how Pan-American musical creation arose organically from interactions between Mexican, Cuban, and U.S. composers. In the final chapter I explain literary and musical connections between African Americans and Latin Americans during the late 1930s. Here I examine four Latin American art songs that participated in the international movement of negritude, or blackness, and incorporated elements of jazz and blues. This chapter provides a necessary counterpoint to the PAAC’s activities by emphasizing connections between African American and Latin American cultures, which circumvented the Anglo-American interpretation of Pan-Americanism that the PAAC espoused.",304877996,,Dissertations & Theses," Stallings, Stephanie N.StallingsN.StephanieStallings, Stephanie N.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1917131671 , 48712441 , 66569 , 9781109512465 , 3385311 , 3385311", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109512465, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304877996?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music",," 0336 Latin American history , 0413 Music"," Latin American history , Music"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Chavez, Carlos , Cowell, Henry , Ideology , Music , Pan-American Association of Composers , Percussion ensemble , Revueltas, Silvestro , Varese, Edgard",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Collective+difference%3A+The+Pan+-American+Association+of+Composers+and+Pan-American+ideology+in+music%2C+1925%E2%80%931945&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stallings%2C+Stephanie+N.&amp;isbn=9781109512465&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Transformation of rebel movements into political parties in transitions from civil conflict: A study of rebels' decision-making amid violence in El Salvador and Zimbabwe,"Efforts to understand modern intrastate conflict require examination of the varied interactions between states and non-state entities battling for control of government. A growing number of civil wars and separatist conflicts, particularly following the end of the Cold War, have been resolved peacefully through negotiated settlements in which rebels abandoned their arms and entered the political arena. While many scholars have studied revolution and democratization in depth, few have focused on explaining the transformation of rebel movements into political parties. Under what conditions do rebel movements engaged in armed conflict with states decide to negotiate, disarm and participate in electoral politics? The analysis relies on historical narrative and process-tracing to uncover complex, interactive causal mechanisms beyond the purely rationalist motives of rebels and régimes. This qualitative study analyzes two revolutionary groups that transformed from violent combatants into political actors in transitions from civil wars–the ZANU/ZAPU movement in Zimbabwe and the FMLN in El Salvador. Three factors–(a) the nature and extent of international influence on the rebels, (b) the rebels' level of popular support and (c) the type of electoral system are hypothesized to impact rebels' decisions. The study examines the shifting mobilization strategies of violent revolutionary groups–and their effects–given particular material and non-material incentives and the interaction of the interests and identities of domestic and international actors in the civil war context. Building on the existing theoretical literature on social revolution, democratization and the participation of ""outsiders"" in electoral politics, the study of rebels' decision-making in civil wars is positioned firmly within scholarship on peace-building and political development.",304878129,,Dissertations & Theses," Finn, Devin M.FinnM.DevinFinn, Devin M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1781954361 , 46643361 , 66569 , 9781109153354 , 1464615 , 1464615", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109153354, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304878129?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law",," 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," Political science , International law"," Social sciences , Civil war , Peace process El Salvador , Political parties , Post-conflict political development , Rebel movements , Southern Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transformation+of+rebel+movements+into+political+parties+in%0Atransitions+from+civil+conflict%3A+A+study+of+rebels%27+decision-making+amid+violence+in+El+Salvador+and+Zimbabwe&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Finn%2C+Devin+M.&amp;isbn=9781109153354&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""White &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; a color: Race and the developing modernism of Jean Toomer, Ernest Hemingway, and William Faulkner","As scholars have conceptualized American Literature, three prominent literary movements or groups of writers were active in the 1920s and 1930s: the Harlem or Black Renaissance; the Lost Generation or Expatriates; the Southern Renaissance. From each group came a writer whose words forever altered the language and construction of American Literature—Jean Toomer, Ernest Hemingway, and William Faulkner, respectively. Concurrently, in the 1920s and 1930s America experienced significant racial turmoil. African American soldiers returning from World War I demanded equal rights with white soldiers; economic hardship exacerbated racism in the workplace; the South and border states firmly established Jim Crow laws. Bloodshed in race riots in twenty-six cities caused the summer of 1919 to be known as the “Red Summer.” In 1922, the House of Representatives passed the Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill. Though the Bill failed in the Senate, lynching became a point of public concern in the 1920s, and its frequency diminished. World War I, which challenged national and personal identities, produced a peace treaty that increased hostile feelings between nations. Both World War I and the subsequent peace challenged white Americans’ understanding of the solidarity of race, the relationship between ethnic groups, and the international effectiveness of racial privilege. Toomer, Hemingway, and Faulkner, then, came of age in a consciously racist America and though their individual experiences with race and racism varied greatly, their writings all demonstrate a heightened awareness of blackness, whiteness, and white privilege. Examining their early work together, we see developing a challenge to whiteness and white privilege in America. This early work establishes social construction of race as one of the institutions challenged by American Modernism. This study focuses on Toomer’s Cane (1923), Hemingway’s In Our Time (1925), and Faulkner’s These 13 (1931). Each is a short-story cycle and involves a dynamism not developed in short-story collections; each shows new choices with language and construction, indicating its seminal role in American Modernism; each includes stories addressing the place of whiteness in social construction. Each writer challenges the accepted understanding of whiteness as well as its role in society. Cane demonstrates the negative effects of whiteness and white privilege on both African Americans and European Americans. In Our Time shows whiteness falling short when challenged by Native Americans, African Americans, and women. These 13 suggests whiteness and white privilege have corrupted the very foundation of democracy and capitalism in the United States. Reading these texts with attention to the social constructions of race and privilege resituates broadly ideas such as Hemingway’s Code. Asserting that courage and honor reside completely in an individual’s choice of value and personal behavior, Hemingway’s Code removes the need for society to define blackness and whiteness against each other, eliminating privilege. One cannot claim from these texts that America embraced Hemingway’s Code or that a nation can survive such individualism, but the potential for social reconstruction is there. Conversely, Faulkner shows the individual subsumed by cultural controls in the South, making identification with race and region more important than the crafting of an independent self. Contradicting the American value of independence, Faulkner’s portrayal of race also argues for its diminishment. Faulkner’s sense that time is not linear—that the past, present, and future interact and can ultimately be expressed in one sentence—makes each construction of blackness and whiteness relevant. Toomer’s belief that America must move away from race as a construct and embrace one hybrid “American Race” likewise eliminates the need for racial construction, comparison, and privilege. Though none of these writers has historically been considered a political activist, the words of these early compositions suggest a citizen’s interest in improving the nation.

This dissertation examines how meaningful and practical action for sustainability may be realized, via the efforts of communities and grassroots movements. Through case studies of three U.S. cities, urban change in electricity systems is assessed according to its relative embrace of sustainability-oriented criteria in energy-social relations, away from more traditional techno-economic criteria. Where change toward sustainability has occurred, an effort is then made to identify what community contexts may be driving or supporting such action, over time. The findings show that urban energy change for greater ecological protection, democratic participation, and equitable socio-economic development is indeed acquiring a local context that appears capable of pioneering and maintaining a social commitment to sustainability over time. Significant are four community-based assets that work together in support of change, to include an engaged “civis” or citizenry, active political leadership, new or reformed institutions, and new policy directions. Also significant are the bottom-up, evolutionary, and multi-dimensional/multi-scale dynamics by which local actors approach the challenge of energy change. These findings suggest that, while full achievement of a sustainable energy future may require efforts from local to global scales, cities may be vital contributors as social incubators for progress in forging a popular commitment to change.",304879892,,Dissertations & Theses," Hughes, KristenHughesKristenHughes, Kristen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1891601521 , 49250551 , 66569 , 9781109393545 , 3373303 , 3373303", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109393545, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304879892?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0640 Sustainability , 0768 Environmental science , 0999 Urban planning"," 0615 Political science , 0640 Sustainability , 0768 Environmental science , 0999 Urban planning"," 0615 Political science , 0640 Sustainability , 0768 Environmental science , 0999 Urban planning",," 0615 Political science , 0640 Sustainability , 0768 Environmental science , 0999 Urban planning"," Political science , Sustainability , Environmental science , Urban planning"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Cities , Energy , Public policy , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+city+as+a+community-based+force+for+sustainability+in+energy+systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hughes%2C+Kristen&amp;isbn=9781109393545&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Pictures that satisfy: Modernist discourses and the politics of race, gender, and nation in the art of Irma Stern (1894–1966)","This dissertation examines South African artist Irma Stern’s contributions to modernism in South Africa and to modernism as a global movement. It analyzes how Stern’s interactions with South Africans, combined with her early artistic training in Germany and her cultural connections to the South African Jewish community, helped her to bring critical issues of race, gender, and nation into focus through her work. This study goes beyond the work of previous scholars who have suggested that Stern was uninterested in social or political causes, arguing that Stern was acutely aware of how social and political themes contributed to modernism’s development in Europe. Moreover, this study concludes that Stern employed similar strategies to develop a South African modernism. Although she often spoke pejoratively about nonwhite South Africans, she was cognizant of the fact that the act of painting nonwhites made significant artistic and political statements. Because Stern is virtually unknown in the United States, this study will do the following: (1) Introduce Stern to an American audience by discussing her work from the beginning of her artistic training in Germany in 1913 to her death in 1966; (2) Reconnect Stern to the larger global debates about modernism in the twentieth century; (3) Analyze Stern’s works that have received little or no attention in previous scholarship; and (4) Discuss the long-term influence that Stern’s work had in shaping the direction of South African art before, during, and after apartheid. Formal analysis and close readings of Stern's oil paintings, drawings, travel narratives, and watercolors are crucial in understanding how she used her artistic talents to record visual interpretations of South African culture history. As one of only a few internationally respected South African artists of the apartheid era, an examination of Stern's work and career allows for a more complex understanding of how race, gender, and nation contributed to the development of modernism in South African art history.",304880915,,Dissertations & Theses," Walker, LaNitra MicheleWalkerMicheleLaNitraWalker, LaNitra Michele",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1698777581 , 42964271 , 66569 , 9781109087987 , 3351937 , 3351937", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109087987, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304880915?accountid=14496," 0331 African history , 0357 Fine arts , 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0331 African history , 0357 Fine arts , 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0331 African history , 0357 Fine arts , 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0331 African history , 0357 Fine arts , 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," African history , Fine arts , Art history , Womens studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Apartheid , Gender , German Expressionism , Modern art , Modernism , Nation , Politics , Race , South Africa , South African art , Stern, Irma",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pictures+that+satisfy%3A++Modernist+discourses+and+the%0Apolitics+of+race%2C+gender%2C+and+nation+in+the+art+of+Irma+Stern+%281894%E2%80%931966%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Walker%2C+LaNitra+Michele&amp;isbn=9781109087987&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Labor policy in new democracies,"How do governments in newly democratized states treat civil society actors that helped to usher out the previous authoritarian regime? Do they reward them with economic rents through policies that are favorable to those actors? Or are these actors ignored in the policy debate following transition? This study focuses on the case of organized labor, a civil society actor with broadly universal policy interests, which tends to play a significant role in both the transition process under autocratic regimes and in the policymaking process under democratic regimes. It examines the correlation of democratization with subsequent labor policy, controlling for lagged effects of pre-transition union activity, trade openness, and workforce professionalization, to determine whether organized labor tends to have greater leverage in influencing labor policy in newly democratized countries than in established democracies. Regression models show that recent democratization has a positive correlation with most measures of labor-friendly policy. This study informs policy for organizations involved in democracy promotion as well as for international social and labor movements engaging with their counterparts in authoritarian states, and suggests that countries experiencing future waves of democratization may take on a more social democratic orientation than a free market policy agenda.",304881598,,Dissertations & Theses," Paarlberg, Michael A.PaarlbergA.MichaelPaarlberg, Michael A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1690058841 , 42785071 , 66569 , 9781109071634 , 1462358 , 1462358", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109071634, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304881598?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration"," 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration"," 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration",," 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration"," Political science , Public administration"," Social sciences , Civil society , Democratization , Development , Labor , Transitions , Unions",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Labor+policy+in+new+democracies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paarlberg%2C+Michael+A.&amp;isbn=9781109071634&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Assessing offense -defense theory: A structural explanation for intrastate war and ethnic conflict,"The relative ease of attack and defense—the offense-defense balance (ODB), is a widely used explanatory concept in international politics. This dissertation proposes that there is a unique and significant effect of the offense-defense balance (ODB) on intrastate war. This project seeks to advance the literature on utilizing ODB to explain domestic outcomes. It will be argued that, in contrast to previous scholars holding that the specific systemic condition of defense-dominance following a period of offense-dominance, in this case the end of the Cold War, correlates with and accounts for internal contraction and ethnic conflict, states do not necessarily contract when the ODB becomes defense-dominant. Instead, the argument will be made that the offense-defense balance within the international system should not be viewed as a cause of ethnic conflict, however, a model of ODB at the state level or the second level of analysis can be utilized as a domestic theory elucidating the causes of intrastate conflict. At the domestic level, a theory of the offense-defense balance based on military factors, social and political order, and diplomatic factors finds that the ODB affects the domestic balance of power and domestic competition for political power and material resources. An ODB of offense dominance leads to the strengthening of an ethnic or secessionist movement when the secessionists perceive that they have the ability to prevail over their rival or the state quickly, the result of increased confidence in the legitimacy of their self-determination claims due to increased capability relative to their opponents. The sides then face a security dilemma in which mobilization by any side can pose a real offensive threat to others. However, this sometimes will lead to intrastate war and sometimes will not. As a proximate cause of intrastate conflict, the interaction of particular domestic variables is still necessary. First, there could be a member of the power elite there to manipulate the domestic situation to stay in power or to get into power. In addition, pre-existing ethnic cleavages or ancient hatreds may play a significant role in identity politics.",304884203,,Dissertations & Theses," Creamer, Scott FrancisCreamerFrancisScottCreamer, Scott Francis",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1851074601 , 48328201 , 66569 , 9781109270938 , 3367346 , 3367346", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109270938, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304884203?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science," Political science , Political theory , Civil war , Minority & ethnic violence"," Social sciences , Ethnic conflict , International security , Intrastate war , Offense-defense",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Assessing+offense+-defense+theory%3A+A+structural+explanation+for+intrastate+war+and+ethnic+conflict&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Creamer%2C+Scott+Francis&amp;isbn=9781109270938&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Islamic terrorism: A war of values &amp;amp; politics as viewed through Hezbollah &amp;amp; Al-Qaeda,"To understand how to combat Islamic terrorism, one must understand the social composition, values, and behaviors of Islamic terrorist leaders. The majority of leaders in Islamic global terrorism are educated, middle-upper class men, associated with privileged backgrounds and opportunity. Unlike the stereotype of terrorists as isolated, uneducated, social misfits, Islamic terrorists justify their call to violent jihad on religious grounds embedded within a community of certain values. Having an astute awareness of the ideology and values espoused by Islamic terrorist movements clarifies the value differentiation between terrorist and non-terrorist groups. Accordingly, this thesis examines the evolution of Islamic terrorist ideology and values as elaborated by the leaders of two such groups (Hezbollah and Al-Qaeda). Through evaluation of Hezbollah's Hassan Nasrallah and Al-Qaeda's Ayman Al-Zawahiri's backgrounds and actual statements, this thesis demonstrates the complexity and diversity present in Islamic terrorism, illustrating that Islamic terrorism is more about politics than religion. Furthermore, the evaluation shows that Nasrallah and Al-Zawahiri have opposing views. Thus, to address Islamic terrorism, the United States must evaluate the political grievances of terrorists that reflect the grievances of Muslims more broadly, specifically, authoritarian leadership in Islamic countries and the reasons for American military presence abroad. By strategically addressing these issues, the U.S. has the opportunity to combat Islamic terrorism and its core values by challenging Islamic terrorism in the war of ideas.",304887638,,Dissertations & Theses," Feehan, KathleenFeehanKathleenFeehan, Kathleen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1930250841 , 49710621 , 66569 , 9781109521528 , 1470584 , 1470584", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109521528, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304887638?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," Social sciences , Al-Qaeda , Hezbollah , Islam , Nasrallah , Terrorism , Zawahiri",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Islamic+terrorism%3A+A+war+of+values+%26amp%3B+politics+as+viewed%0Athrough+Hezbollah+%26amp%3B+Al-Qaeda&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Feehan%2C+Kathleen&amp;isbn=9781109521528&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Development through capitalism? A study of microinsurance in West Bengal, India","One of the first in-depth field studies on microinsurance, this research focuses on the development intervention, which is the latest in the “micro-wave” of movements sweeping international development. Featuring unprecedented partnerships between insurance corporations and development organisations, microinsurance is aimed at extending micro-cost insurance and social safety to low-income populations traditionally marginalised by these services. In India, microinsurance is the result of liberalisation economic reforms in the country in the early 1990s. Here microinsurance is a nascent intervention, and this study examines the provision, availability and impacts of microinsurance in the disaster-prone rural Malda district of West Bengal—a state famous for its pro-poor and left-leaning government. Research for this thesis was conducted in the form of a multi-sited case study spanning a period of six months from May to October 2007. A mix of qualitative and quantitative methods such as household surveying, direct observation, open-ended semi-structured interviews, key-informant interviews, life histories and snowball sampling were employed for data collection. The Sustainable Livelihoods Framework (SLF) served as the primary theoretical lens of this thesis, allowing for the finding that the most vulnerable populations in Malda are falling through the cracks of microinsurance provision as it exists in West Bengal today.",304890115,,Dissertations & Theses," Majumdar, AnanyaMajumdarAnanyaMajumdar, Ananya",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1716596481 , 43349111 , 66569 , 9780494477953 , MR47795 , MR47795", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494477953, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304890115?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0501 Economics , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Economics , Political science , Public policy , Social structure", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Development+through+capitalism%3F+A+study+of+microinsurance+in+West+Bengal%2C+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Majumdar%2C+Ananya&amp;isbn=9780494477953&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Reflections of freedom: Race, caste, and the shared struggle for democracy in the United States and India, 1914–1965","Drawing on a range of published and unpublished sources from archives in India, Britain, and the United States, this dissertation charts the efforts of diverse historical actors—some well-known and others largely forgotten—to unite the freedom struggles of South Asians and African Americans. Beginning in the late nineteenth century, South Asians and African Americans learned from each other in ways that not only advanced their respective struggles for freedom, but also helped define what freedom could and should mean. This transnational exchange did not entail the clean transfer of ideas, practices, or identities. Rather, a bi-directional process of self-transformation through self-recognition bridged struggles that were themselves internally diverse. Looking abroad and seeing oneself involved reflection in both senses of the word—a partial mirroring and a great amount of thought and practice. This work focuses on the evolution and political significance of two analogies—one comparing African Americans with all colonized subjects of the British Raj and the other comparing African Americans with Dalits (“Untouchables”). These analogies, always political, increasingly became enmeshed in global power politics, especially during the Second World War and the Cold War. While assessing the elisions and missed opportunities involved in analogizing disparate social and political movements, this dissertation argues that an unrecognized continuity of exchange linked African Americans and South Asians in opposition to what many understood as the intersection of racism, imperialism, and oppressions based on caste, class, and gender. Analyzing these historical exchanges, this thesis contributes to scholarly debates regarding diaspora, cosmopolitanism, racial formation, anti-colonial and post-colonial nationalisms, nonviolent civil disobedience, Afro-Indian solidarity, the origins of the Third World, and the relationship between the Cold War and the American Civil Rights Movement.",304892550,,Dissertations & Theses," Slate, NicoSlateNicoSlate, Nico",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1853258161 , 48372761 , 66569 , 9781109256864 , 3365439 , 3365439", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109256864, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304892550?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," 0328 Black history , 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," 0328 Black history , 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure",," 0328 Black history , 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," Black history , History , American history , Modern history , Social structure"," Social sciences , African-American , Caste , Cold war civil rights , Colored cosmopolitanism , India , Race , Racial diplomacy , South Asian , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reflections+of+freedom%3A+Race%2C+caste%2C+and+the+shared+struggle%0Afor+democracy+in+the+United+States+and+India%2C+1914%E2%80%931965&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Slate%2C+Nico&amp;isbn=9781109256864&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Trans-Pacific popular mediascape: In search of girlhood through Korean immigrant teenage girls' image-production and webculture,"My dissertation provides an ethnographic account of the cultural practice of teenage U.S. immigrant Korean girls in the specific context of webpages created through a Korean social networking website called Cyworld. Their webpages are understood as personal narratives about what it means to be a Korean girl, which are informed by trans-Pacific popular cultural experiences. This research examines how the girls use their digital images and texts to unpack gendered practices across national boundaries. Since the late 1990s, South Korea's national movement towards globalization has propelled unprecedented immigration of middle class Korean girls to the U.S. This phenomenon reflects their social desire to receive a better education for securing professional success and to achieve the cosmopolitan urban lifestyle encouraged by popular media, which perpetuate ideals about women's lives. Regardless of their desire to be a global citizen as motivated by mainstream Korean societal thought, they are essentially labeled as an underrepresented minority or outsider in the U.S. It is ironic that, for these girls, becoming a global citizen demands exclusion from U.S. mainstream society. In this context, fanatic use of Cyworld webpages by teenage Korean girls reflects their resistance to the cultural demand of conforming to middle-class white U.S. social norms and their feelings of nostalgia for Korea, presenting ethnic femininity but in a culturally hybrid form. While they show their ethnic side of femininity, they also challenge some ethnic motifs and values of Korean popular culture. This negotiation of ethnic femininity as a form of cultural resistance takes place in a mode of play, in which they are released from the social pressures upon them, and they are able to freely explore and express their ideas and values of what it means to be a Korean girl in the U.S. Such recreation of ethnic femininity in the Cyworld webpages suggests the expansion of Pan-Koreaness, an ideal form of globalization desired by South Korean society. From this perspective, contemporary Korean girls with trans-national experience are potentially cultural producers who use webpages as an arena for seeking gendered identities. My dissertation asserts that this complex and contradictory mode in the recreation of ethnic femininity is an act of an alternative agency they take through their play in their webpages.",304895207,,Dissertations & Theses," Bae, Michelle SuehyunBaeSuehyunMichelleBae, Michelle Suehyun",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1825815341 , 47684301 , 66569 , 9781109222692 , 3362721 , 3362721", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109222692, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304895207?accountid=14496," 0273 Art education , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies"," 0273 Art education , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies"," 0273 Art education , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies",," 0273 Art education , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies"," Art education , Cultural anthropology , Mass communications , Gender studies"," Communication and the arts , Education , Social sciences , Cyberculture , Girlhood , Girls' image production , Image production , Immigrant , Korean , Korean girls , Popular culture , Teenage culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Trans-Pacific+popular+mediascape%3A+In+search+of+girlhood+through+Korean+immigrant+teenage+girls%27+image-production+and+webculture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bae%2C+Michelle+Suehyun&amp;isbn=9781109222692&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Contesting development and globalization in Mongolia,"Outside observers seldom dispute that people in ""developing"" countries disproportionately bear the adverse effects of globalization, but they tend to use the terms ""winners"" and ""losers"" as static, passive and uncritical designations. How do those who live in so-called developing societies find agency in the global processes in which they supposedly ""lose""? In this dissertation, I use discourse analysis to explore Mongolian experiences of development and globalization, using original interviews with forty Mongolian citizens active in politics and civil society in 2007, along with Mongolian print and broadcast media from the same time period. I first relate the narratives of four individuals positioned differently in their society—a businessman, a doctor, a grant writer, and an activist—to reveal the lived experiences of development and globalization: the social, economic, political and environmental changes that affect people's bodies and minds, give shape to their views, and motivate them to act. I then conduct a broader synthetic analysis of these and other citizens' perspectives with regard to the mining controversy that currently dominates Mongolian politics. Treating development as a site of contestation, rather than a set of depoliticized policy goals with predetermined winners and losers, I illustrate the ways in which globalization and development reshape civil society and reconfigure social movements both within Mongolia and beyond its borders. Mongolian citizens engage in everyday struggles to affect the future of their society. On a daily basis, they leverage their gendered, socio-culturally embedded experiences of inequality to contest the uses of Mongolia's land and resources, the scope of its development policies, and its geopolitical position with regard to powerful outsiders.",304899507,,Dissertations & Theses," Combellick-Bidney, SarahCombellick-BidneySarahCombellick-Bidney, Sarah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1921503151 , 49223621 , 66569 , 9781109503043 , 3380069 , 3380069", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109503043, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304899507?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," Political science , Social structure"," Social sciences , Contestation , Development , Globalization , Mining , Mongolia , Politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contesting+development+and+globalization+in+Mongolia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Combellick-Bidney%2C+Sarah&amp;isbn=9781109503043&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Building judicial capacity in the early American state: Legal populism, county courts, and credit, 1645–1860","Because the early American state lacked the military, bureaucratic, and judicial capacities found in stronger modern states for controlling territory, providing public services, and managing the economy, early American political development offers political scientists studying the role of law in society an excellent case study of how judicial institutions develop. Yet, given the limited power and influence of the Supreme Court, federal district courts and circuit courts before the Civil War, the answer of how the nation built its judicial capacity is not to be found in the development of a national judicial bureaucracy. Rather, an answer is to be found in the following fact. By the time of the Civil War, America was already knitted together by an extensive and powerful multi-tiered network of local county courts with independent constitutional authority, supported by a democratic populist legal culture and deeply rooted in the economic and social lives of Americans. This study highlights the contribution of the mid-seventeenth century English legal reform movement, including ideas of ancient constitutionalism and the theory of the Norman Yoke, on American ideas about access to local civil justice as a necessary condition for free and equal citizenship. In addition, it documents the institutional structure and expansion of county courts in the early American state. Furthermore, synthesizing the work of sociolegal scholars, legal historians, and new institutional economists, this essay argues that in the absence of modern institutions to match borrowers and lenders, local courts were heavily involved in the process of financial intermediation. The dissertation begins with a critique of the current field of American public law, arguing for more developmental, institutional, transnational and subnational studies, rather than studies focused on the role of courts in well-functioning, modern, pluralist democracies. This dissertation suggests the field of early American legal development provides a fruitful platform for producing such studies and for dialogue between students of American public law, American political development, historical institutionalism, and analytical narratives.",304914244,,Dissertations & Theses," Peel, PatrickPeelPatrickPeel, Patrick",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1953861151 , 41785991 , 66569 , 9781109577259 , 3392369 , 3392369", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109577259, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304914244?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science"," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science"," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science",," 0337 American history , 0398 Law , 0615 Political science"," American history , Law , Political science"," Social sciences , Ancient constitutionalism , County courts , Credit , Judicial capacity , Legal populism , Local courts , Norman Yoke , Rule of law",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+judicial+capacity+in+the+early+American+state%3A+Legal+populism%2C+county+courts%2C+and+credit%2C+1645%E2%80%931860&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Peel%2C+Patrick&amp;isbn=9781109577259&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The aura of the Irish book: The Cuala and Dolmen Presses,"Irish printing in the early years of the Celtic Revival had fallen into disarray, and as a response to this circumstance, Elizabeth Yeats and her brother W.B.

He was instrumental in raising funds for poor relief and establishing soup and bread kitchens there during the winter of 1816-1817. His interest and research on penal discipline brought him national prominence and led to a parliamentary seat which he held for nearly two decades. Buxton's association with noted activist William Wilberforce (1759-1833) led to his own involvement in the anti-slavery movement, a cause he fiercely championed, resulting in Britain's abolition of slavery throughout the Empire in 1834. After leaving Parliament in 1837, Buxton focused on revitalizing Africa through a program to end international slavery and encourage African self-sufficiency. This resulted in the disastrous 1841 Niger expedition that effectively ended Buxton's public career and paved the way to British imperialism in Africa. Buxton was a man of many interests, and aside from his work for penal reform, poor relief, and abolition, he also supported Catholic emancipation and ending the Hindu suttee. Few nineteenth-century social reformers have had as much of an impact or have cast as long a shadow as Buxton. At the time of his death, many saw him as the epitome of Christian activism. Yet, today Buxton remains largely ignored and forgotten. The intent of this study is to examine the life of one of Great Britain's most prominent social activists. Using his Memoirs, personal papers, and the papers and books of his friends, associates, and contemporaries, I have sought to paint a portrait of an individual driven by religious motives and idealism to improve his world.",304923226,,Dissertations & Theses," Bruce, David S.BruceS.DavidBruce, David S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1921646291 , 46846531 , 66569 , 9781109494877 , 3379795 , 3379795", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109494877, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304923226?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0331 African history , 0335 European history"," 0304 Biographies , 0331 African history , 0335 European history"," 0304 Biographies , 0331 African history , 0335 European history",," 0304 Biographies , 0331 African history , 0335 European history"," Biographies , African history , European history"," Social sciences , Abolition , Africa , Buxton, Thomas Fowell, Sir , Great Britain , Slavery , Social reform",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9COrdinary+talents+and+extraordinary+perseverance%E2%80%9D%3A%0AThe+life+of+Sir+Thomas+Fowell+Buxton&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bruce%2C+David+S.&amp;isbn=9781109494877&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“In order to establish justice”: The nineteenth-century woman suffrage movements of Maine and New Brunswick,"The study of the nineteenth-century woman suffrage movements in Maine and New Brunswick brings to light the struggles of Americans and Canadians to define a wider democracy and citizenry amid times of profound socio-economic changes. Targeting the struggle for the female vote allows the historian to explore time-honored ideas about womanhood, manhood, and membership in a national political body. In the Borderlands of Maine and New Brunswick, a place where historians see cultural connections, the border loomed large. Borderlands historians have virtually ignored women's political behavior in this region. This study will demonstrate that although Maine and New Brunswick women both tapped into the ideals of the Enlightenment and individual and property rights, their political work diverged by the turn of the twentieth century. The women, with a history of working together on issues of temperance, religion and slavery that transcended the border, were more tuned into the work of their national organizations and political structures when it came to suffrage. Maine woman suffrage was shaped by the American Revolutionary War and its ideals, the rights of citizens, which allowed for a process of professionalization and radicalism. Maine women also had training in the anti-slavery movement, which strengthened their ideas about woman suffrage. By the turn of the twentieth century, Maine suffragists had strong ties to national and international suffrage organizations, and drew upon these to bolster their own stateside cause. In New Brunswick, the Loyalist legacy continued, in the nineteenth century, with its emphasis on hierarchy and the importance of property ownership, to influence ideas about suffrage and women's place in society. Despite a brief blossoming of female leadership connected to the Maritime Woman's Christian Temperance Union and Saint John suffragists, female reformers could not always target the vote as their chief goal, nor did they attempt to fight for it as citizens, but rather, as property owners. In this respect, the New Brunswick suffrage movement was dampened by the social gospel movement that sought to bring religion to the streets, other women's reform causes, and the limitations of land-owning suffrage, by the early twentieth century.",304923320,,Dissertations & Theses," Risk, Shannon M.RiskM.ShannonRisk, Shannon M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1836497321 , 47941111 , 66569 , 9781109245189 , 3364713 , 3364713", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109245189, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304923320?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history",," 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history"," Canadian history , American history , Womens studies , Modern history"," Social sciences , Canada , Maine , New Brunswick , Nineteenth century , Vote/voting , Voting , Woman suffrage , Women's history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CIn+order+to+establish+justice%E2%80%9D%3A++The+nineteenth-century+woman+suffrage+movements+of+Maine+and+New+Brunswick&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Risk%2C+Shannon+M.&amp;isbn=9781109245189&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Gendered moves: Mobile subjects in Atlantic Rim literature and film,"Gendered Moves examines figures of mobility and gendered subjectivity in women's writing and film from Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Canada, Iceland and the Anglophone-Caribbean. Focusing on literary productions of women who relocate themselves and situate their work in multiple national sites throughout the Atlantic Rim, this study begins with the observation that the crisis of representation affecting nation-oriented literatures and models of identity is a product of a proliferation of differences that becomes an aesthetic strategy in mobile women's fiction and theory. This project draws on an equally wide-range of critical discourses—including Postcolonial, Irish, and Sex/Gender Studies—to account for the various ways Atlantic Rim women artists use mobility to challenge narrative conventions and socio-political orders. Alongside the rise of transnational and transatlantic studies, analyses of travel figures have gained critical currency. Feminist scholars interested in mobility and transnationalism have generally attended to the socio-historical conditions informing notions of migrancy and exile as well as to the gendering of transnational experience in literature. My project, rather than charting a subject's movement across historical and material landscapes, investigates the gendered and politicized landscapes of narrative. Broadly, this study incorporates theories of narrativity, psychoanalytic feminism, and postcolonialism to examine the figuration and enactment of mobility as it redefines what it means to write and locate the self simultaneously. Expanding upon (post)modernist experimentations with form to enact new kinds of subjectivities and narratives of self, mobile women writers and filmmakers utilize formal experimentation to perform feminine subjectivity as mobile and elsewhere to a masculine social imaginary.",304929644,,Dissertations & Theses," Banister Quynn, KristinaBanister QuynnKristinaBanister Quynn, Kristina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1976004981 , 49347731 , 66569 , 9781109644647 , 3396095 , 3396095", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109644647, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304929644?accountid=14496," 0352 Canadian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0362 Icelandic & Scandinavian literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0352 Canadian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0362 Icelandic & Scandinavian literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0352 Canadian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0362 Icelandic & Scandinavian literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0352 Canadian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0362 Icelandic & Scandinavian literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Canadian literature , Caribbean literature , Icelandic & Scandinavian literature , Womens studies , British and Irish literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Anglophone , Atlantic Rim , Feminism , Gender , Subjectivity , Transatlantic , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gendered+moves%3A+Mobile+subjects+in+Atlantic+Rim+literature+and+film&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Banister+Quynn%2C+Kristina&amp;isbn=9781109644647&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The empire's new walls: Sovereignty, neo-liberalism, and the production of space in post-apartheid South Africa and post-Oslo Palestine/Israel","This dissertation examines the relationship between neo-liberal restructuring, political transition, and the reorganization of urban space in Palestine/Israel and South Africa over the last 20 years. My research combines comparative historical, ethnographic, and visual methodologies, and is located at the intersection of three sociological literatures: neo-liberalism and empire; sovereignty and state formation; and the spatial turn in the social sciences. I begin by demonstrating that neither the Oslo peace process nor the transition from apartheid to democracy can be understood apart from the neo-liberalization of the South African and Israeli economies. The two states have followed similar paths from racial Fordism to neo-liberalism, but the South African state was democratized while Israel simply restructured its occupation. I then examine the impact of these large-scale processes on the spatial restructuring of Johannesburg and Jerusalem. Analyzing the interplay between state formation, capital accumulation, social movements, and everyday life practices, I argue that the construction of walled enclosures in both cities is a response to the inequality and insecurity caused by neo-liberal restructuring. But these enclosures have taken different forms—privatized in Johannesburg and state-centered in Jerusalem—due to the divergent trajectories of political restructuring in the two states. Throughout the dissertation, I argue that urban restructuring in Johannesburg and Jerusalem as well as the broader political and economic transitions in South Africa and Palestine/Israel helped produce a fundamental shift in global power relations. This imperial transition constitutes an important shift in world-historical time and helps explain important differences between the Bantustan strategy in apartheid-era South Africa and the enclosure strategy in contemporary Palestine/Israel. I end with an analysis of the ongoing crises of regulation that have generated insecurity for everyone in South Africa, Palestine/Israel, and throughout the empire. Racialized discourses of crime and terrorism magnify the perception of threat, obscure the causes of insecurity, and provide a mechanism for policing the crisis.",304940194,,Dissertations & Theses," Clarno, Andrew JamesClarnoJamesAndrewClarno, Andrew James",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1740559251 , 43860991 , 66569 , 9781109115208 , 3354129 , 3354129", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109115208, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304940194?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Israel , Neoliberalism , Palestine , South Africa , Sovereignty , Space , State , Urban , Walls",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+empire%27s+new+walls%3A+Sovereignty%2C+neo-liberalism%2C+and+the+production+of+space+in+post-apartheid+South+Africa+and+post-Oslo+Palestine%2FIsrael&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clarno%2C+Andrew+James&amp;isbn=9781109115208&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Participatory development and its emergence in the fields of community and international development,"Since World War II, participatory development (PD), part of the alternative development movement, has evolved from a fringe approach to meeting basic human needs, to a globally recognized paradigm that is informing the strategic decisions regarding community and international development by governments and multi-lateral and indigenous NGOs, as well as management practices in the private sector. This is a study of (1) the evolution of this phenomenon since the 1940s in the context of historical events and dominant theories that inform most development (modernization-globalization and dependency-world-system), and (2) PD itself, including its basic features, methods, case examples, and roots in academic schools, related social movements, and theoretical and philosophical traditions. In the course of the analysis, developmental concepts related to PD are explored and defined, including: community, development, community development, capacity-building, project, decentralization, civil society, empowerment, self-reliance, and sustainable development. There are two important contributions to the field of development that this dissertation study makes. First, by explaining PD and its related concepts, an alternative-participatory development model is constructed that shows their inter-relationships within a social system. And second, a foundation is established to build PD theory by way of relating clear explanations of PD—its essential components and related concepts—to broad social theories that can reveal in greater scope consequences of PD in society.",304946923,,Dissertations & Theses," Ben-Meir, YossefBen-MeirYossefBen-Meir, Yossef",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1811224601 , 47338131 , 66569 , 9781109221909 , 3359812 , 3359812", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109221909, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304946923?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0344 Social research , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," 0344 Social research , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure",," 0344 Social research , 0630 Public policy , 0700 Social structure"," Social research , Public policy , Social structure"," Social sciences , Bottom-up , Community development , Empowerment , Participatory development , Self-reliance , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Participatory+development+and+its+emergence+in+the+fields+of+community+and+international+development&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ben-Meir%2C+Yossef&amp;isbn=9781109221909&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Amma's daughters: A transmodern study of personal, gender, cultural, and religious identities amongst women in the Amma Community in United States","Using a transmodern philosophical approach, this study illustrates the different ways in which women devotees and participants in the Amma Community in United States experience processes of personal and social identification and disidentification as they strive to follow a spiritual path. The study uses the framework of spirituality, which is defined as the journey of disidentification from personal and social identities to the state of connectedness, to highlight how spirituality works in particular and contextual ways amongst Amma's daughters in the community to enable alternative transmodern articulations of self and difference. The study focuses on four areas—personal, gender, cultural, and religious identities—to make the argument that the particular ways in which identities are negotiated in these areas can provide insights for theoretical reflection and praxis on social change and global peace. In each area of study, modern understandings in that area is used as the foundation on which ancient knowledges and conceptualizations create new dimensions and articulate new readings to result in a transmodern understanding of that subject area. Each dimension of identity studied showed its characteristic movements. In the area of personal identities, devotees and participants struggled with each other for Amma's attention and for each other's recognition and acceptance to validate and secure their personal identities. At the same time, many also disidentified and stepped inwards to a state of deep self-awareness and regulation to find the root of conflict not in external differences but in the very state of difference created by ego (forces of individuation). In the area of gender identity, Amma's teachings have motivated some devotees and participants to articulate gender by disidentifying the concept from the notion of ""who am I"" into mutable, voluntary roles that they could play in different social situations. At the same time, they understood their gender identity as a composite of masculine, feminine, and any other aspect in the universe which they bracketed in a very feminine term of ""motherhood."" This grounding allowed some of them to transform their interaction with male partners from confrontation to education and mutual respect. In the area of cultural identity, devotees and participants found unique ways to consolidate their Western cultural identities and at times found it difficult to develop a full cultural awareness of the East Indian practices and norms. This, I have argued, could be improved through an intracultural awareness, a process by which we can understand the cultural roots of our assumptions and disengage from it. At other times, devotees and participants did succeed in disidentifying from their cultural structures through either a theoretical postulation or an experiential reality of an underlying unity. Finally, in the area of religious identity, the dialectics of identification and disidentification allowed for a deeper inquiry into religious differences in the form of intrareligious dialogue. The findings pointed to the importance of including disidentification and self-awareness in the scholarship in communication and presented a revision of the transactional communication model which may enable Asiacentric scholars to study communication in new ways.",304947044,,Dissertations & Theses," Upadhyaya, BhavanaUpadhyayaBhavanaUpadhyaya, Bhavana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1967904971 , 48542121 , 66569 , 9781109611748 , 3390829 , 3390829", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109611748, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304947044?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication , 0647 Spirituality"," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication , 0647 Spirituality"," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication , 0647 Spirituality",," 0453 Womens studies , 0459 Communication , 0647 Spirituality"," Womens studies , Communication , Spirituality"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Amma Mata Amritanandamayi , Asia-centrism , Gender , Identity , Spirituality , Transmodern , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Amma%27s+daughters%3A+A+transmodern+study+of+personal%2C+gender%2C+cultural%2C+and+religious+identities+amongst+women+in+the+Amma+Community+in+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Upadhyaya%2C+Bhavana&amp;isbn=9781109611748&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Fascism, cultural revolution, and national sovereignty in 1930s China","This dissertation traces the emergence and consequences of ""cultural revolution"" as it was elaborated by the fascist factions that dominated China's ruling Nationalist Party from 1927-1937. I develop a novel account of the origins of cultural revolution in China by revealing how this concept, typically identified with the Chinese Communist Party, was articulated by Nationalist politicians and soldiers on the eve of World War II to transform China into a militantly-united, self-sufficient, and sovereign nation state. I argue that Nationalist concern to foment a cultural revolution emerged from a confluence of global, regional, and local socio-political transformations and intellectual developments. Building upon ideas and tactics inherited from the May Fourth Movement of 1919 and the Nationalist Party's 1923-1927 experience of Comintern patronage, 1930s fascists articulated an organized program for creating nationalistic artworks and radically transforming popular thinking and everyday activity. Nationalist attention to cultural transformation as a precondition for broad-scale structural change was on the one hand conditioned by China's semi-colonized circumstances, and on the other by the dynamics of civil war as it unfolded after 1927. Openly challenging the incipient cultural revolutionary agenda of the Chinese Communist Party and mirroring the dramatic rightward march of nationalist movements around the world, interwar Nationalists emphasized China's Confucian-spiritual unity and the power of mass action to achieve a sovereign national polity amidst an increasingly volatile world. Throughout the 1930s, Nationalist leaders and supporters anxiously anticipated that the rising fascist powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy intended to carve out empires of their own from those currently possessed by England, France, and the United States. To thwart China's full colonization by Japan, Nationalists proposed ever-more draconian measures to foster rapid industrialization and to bolster civilian capacities for self-defense. This dissertation documents how the Nationalist right called for a cultural revolution, one aspect of which was the New Life Movement, to rationalize everyday behavior, to inculcate work discipline, and to foster respect for Confucian social hierarchies. In tandem with nationalistic films, literature, and artwork, these measures aimed to cultivate the national unity necessary to eradicate communism and avert the impending Japanese occupation.",304952478,,Dissertations & Theses," Clinton, MargaretClintonMargaretClinton, Margaret",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1922324021 , 49889761 , 66569 , 9781109504903 , 3380177 , 3380177", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109504903, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304952478?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," Social sciences , China , Cultural revolution , Fascism , National development , National sovereignty , Nineteen 30s",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fascism%2C+cultural+revolution%2C+and+national+sovereignty+in+1930s+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clinton%2C+Margaret&amp;isbn=9781109504903&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Contesting capital: A history of political theatre in postcolonial Delhi,"Contesting Capital: A History of Political Theatre in Postcolonial Delhi explores political theatre of the post-Independence era both on stage and on the streets of India's capital city. Taking cue from Gramsci's conception of Left progressive culture work as challenging and changing the existing hegemony of the dominant classes, my primary concern is with the efficacy of political performance. I argue that dramatic practices are embedded in the dynamics of state and popular power, and locate my analysis at the nexus of theatre and organized politics. I examine the work of the Indian People's Theatre Association, Habib Tanvir, Bengali diasporic theatre, theatre of the women's movement, the theatre of Safdar Hashmi, and Jana Natya Manch, the group he founded. My analysis questions the category of the 'political.' What it means to be political at different times is interrogated through how theatre has responded to Delhi's shifting configurations of electoral power. Contesting Capital extends the study of modern Indian theatre beyond the well-made play to include street theatre and other forms of protest performance. It goes beyond text and playwright to analyze the stagecraft of the director and bodily practices of the actor. I propose political performance as a new paradigm for understanding and negotiating the impasse between 'traditional' theatre and 'colonial' influence. In the postcolonial era, political performance, with its at once local constituencies and its international ideologies, subverts the official imperatives for a homogenous 'national culture' and aligns itself with the people by creating a vernacular, relevant, heterogeneous aesthetic with a popular and didactic appeal. Through the social, participatory and popular medium of political performance, I also provide a portrait of a city. Delhi has been the capital of successive empires. Since Independence it has (re)invented itself as a global megapolis through bureaucratic intervention and capitalist enterprise. Under these twin pressures, how does political theatre carve a space for dissent within its increasingly policed commons? Contesting Capital, through an examination of the ways in which people mount local strategies of resistance to neocolonial and corporate power, is also the history of the politicization of a Delhi city.",304958140,,Dissertations & Theses," Mitra, ShayoniMitraShayoniMitra, Shayoni",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1922371381 , 49890951 , 66569 , 9781109505399 , 3380225 , 3380225", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109505399, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304958140?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0644 Theater History"," 0332 History , 0644 Theater History"," 0332 History , 0644 Theater History",," 0332 History , 0644 Theater History"," History , Theater History"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Delhi , India , Performance , Political , Political theatre , Postcolonial , Theatre",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contesting+capital%3A+A+history+of+political+theatre+in+postcolonial+Delhi&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mitra%2C+Shayoni&amp;isbn=9781109505399&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Life on the farm: Making North Carolina's agricultural landscape sustainable,"Since the 1980s, farmers, researchers and activists have questioned the effects on the environment and public health of conventional agriculture, which uses fossil-fuel based agricultural chemicals to produce crops. Although conventional agricultural methods are capable of producing large crop yields with less labor than other methods, research has linked these methods to global warming, harming natural resources and endangering public health. These concerns spurred a sustainable farming movement that is concerned with three pillars of sustainability: environmental health, economic viability and social equity. This thesis, comprising three print articles, explores sustainable farming in North Carolina. First, this thesis studies the economic viability of farming in a profile of an organic farmer. Second, it explores how a community garden teaches individuals about the environment and impacts gardeners’ lives.

By an analysis of social movements and political groups on the right and the left, my work illuminates the dialogic interactions of past understanding and present action which shaped France in the Fifth Republic. The study of French reactions to the war challenges current historiography on France in the pre-1968 era and rewrites our understanding of how the riots of May '68 emerged, as well as situating post-'68 political and social shifts within an international framework. Through its focus, the dissertation clearly brings out the contention within France over French identities and France's role in the world, while highlighting France's move from a power at a loss without its colonies to a nation with a new mission as international mediator and ally to countries undergoing revolutionary change.",304962433,,Dissertations & Theses," Keenan, Bethany S.KeenanS.BethanyKeenan, Bethany S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1742044641 , 43660351 , 66569 , 9781109115468 , 3354498 , 3354498", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109115468, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304962433?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history",," 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," European history , Modern history"," Social sciences , France , Identity , Protests , United States , Vietnam War",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CVietnam+is+fighting+for+us%E2%80%9D%3A+French+identities%0Aand+the+U.S.-Vietnam+War%2C+1965%E2%80%931973&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Keenan%2C+Bethany+S.&amp;isbn=9781109115468&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Missionary millennium: The American West; North and West Africa in the Christian imagination,"During the 1890s in the United States, Midwestern YMCA missionaries challenged the nexus of power between Northeastern Protestant denominations, industrialists, politicians, and the Association’s International Committee.

Why and how did Americans make the Ohio River the division between slavery and freedom? How did they accommodate this river that drew its life from northern and southern sources and divided two worlds? As the Civil War split the country, why did this borderland fail to break apart at the seam of freedom and slavery? The Ohio River was both a boundary and an artery of movement that united the region. The river encouraged the peopling of its valleys: each succession of settlers, Ohio Indians, French traders, and English colonists met at its banks, creating a border. When Americans seized this international borderland, they made the Ohio River the legislated boundary between slavery and freedom, but the movement generated by the river created ties that crossed the divide. By 1816 Americans established a border that separated slave states from free states, and a river that divided bound labor between slavery on the southern bank and servitude on the northern one. The Ohio River split the North from the South on a map, but at this periphery of slavery and freedom, these fundamental nineteenth century dichotomies behaved more like rivers than static ideals. The river linked borderland slavery with borderland free labor, as wage labor and chattel slavery became points on a capitalist continuum rather than mutually exclusive categories for black Americans. Enslaved and free African Americans found no refuge north of the river, and, south of the river, the slave trade expedited the flow of blacks to the Deep South. White Americans on both sides of the river found common cause by embracing the Ohio River’s role in the movement of blacks out of the borderland. These conservative antislavery whites claimed the river gave the region social and economic coherence that outweighed the border. By the 1850s, politicians and residents defined the region as a borderland, denouncing threats of disunion offered by pro and antislavery radicals. Even the Civil War failed to split this borderland as the nation broke in two.",304963356,,Dissertations & Theses," Salafia, MatthewSalafiaMatthewSalafia, Matthew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2042683821 , 52337261 , 66569 , 9781109754278 , 3406909 , 3406909", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109754278, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304963356?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," Black history , American history"," Social sciences , Borderland , Fugitive slaves , Indiana , Kentucky , Ohio River , Slavery",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Slavery%27s+borderland%3A+Freedom+and+bondage+along+the+Ohio+River%2C+1787-1851&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Salafia%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781109754278&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Copper capitalism today: Space, state and development in North Western Zambia","The days of doom and gloom in descriptions of African social and economic realities seem increasingly passé. After two decades of economic decline, externally imposed austerity, and deprivation, Africa is being widely seen as having turned the corner. Recent investment has produced a boom in extractive industries and relatively high rates of economic growth in the countries where these industries dominate the economy. These changes have fuelled fresh visions of an African 'renaissance'. Others see these developments as a new page of an older history of booms and busts in Africa's extractive industries, and with them, the respective national economies. These patterns coincide to a large degree with the vicissitudes of world commodity markets, and are therefore highly inconstant and unpredictable. Past busts have forced ordinary Africans and social scientists alike to continually reevaluate the continent's place in the globalized world. A simple question, therefore, underlies this research: Is the new mining boom an African economic revival or a rerun of the previous cycle of growth and eventual decline? Using Zambia as a window, this dissertation examines the geographies of mining, state, and development in Africa. It draws upon ethnographic fieldwork in Zambia's North Western Province to illuminate the reconfigurations of people, places, and power set in motion by a copper mining boom. Two large copper mines have begun operations there in the last three years employing more than 7000 workers, and have led to the rapid transformation of a previously agricultural and supposedly 'backward' province. The dissertation makes four broad arguments. First, it argues that there are both continuities and shifts in the developmental patterns of the new boom. While it is still export-oriented and thus susceptible to global booms and busts, new sites of development are emerging that are outside of the historical capitalist 'enclaves'. Second, the boom has revived grassroots civil society movements that call for greater national ownership of resources and the benefits accruing from them. These are movements that are critical in terms of the long-term effects of the boom. As for the rural areas, and third, the local structures of authority are being reshaped.

Through these families’ altered but unbroken ties to each other, they created a trans-Pacific society, a transnational imagined community built on economic, social, cultural, and intellectual exchanges and co-dependence. As early as the 1880s, migrants began creating “ Huawen xuetang ”, Chinese schools for their children in major cities, especially in the political, economic, and cultural centres of San Francisco, California, and Victoria, British Columbia. These schools are windows into the heart of this geographically dispersed society. An examination of the complex and changing educational landscapes in San Francisco and Victoria reveals that prior to and during this period of migration and settlement, cultures in China, Canada, and the United States were in flux and cross-border influences and movements led to even more significant changes for migrants. More importantly, changing ideas about how to educate the next generation reflected how Chinese North American communities shifted from regional and lineage identities to more culturally-based yet also more inclusive ways of self-labelling, and eventually to explicitly political identities by the early twentieth century. Despite these transformations, these seemingly new identities remained rooted in personal, familial, and native-place ties. This study is both transnational (in its emphasis on the Chinese diaspora) and comparative (in its examination of Chinese schools in both Canada and the United States). Both approaches challenge a blinkered nation-based narrative and give agency to migrants and their families by reconstructing their histories through their lens and words.",304982174,,Dissertations & Theses," Huang, BelindaHuangBelindaHuang, Belinda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1830109491 , 47787431 , 66569 , 9781109252873 , 3364537 , 3364537", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109252873, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304982174?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0332 History , 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," 0332 History , 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure",," 0332 History , 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history , 0340 Educational sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0700 Social structure"," History , Canadian history , American history , Educational sociology , Ethnic studies , Social structure , Canada , United States--US"," Social sciences , Education , Canada , Chinese North America , Chinese education , Chinese schools , Chinese schools in Canada , Chinese schools in North America , Chinese schools in U.S. , Immigrants , Trans-Pacific society , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Teaching+Chineseness+in+the+trans-Pacific+society%3A%0AOverseas+Chinese+education+in++*Canada+and+the+United+States%2C+1900%E2%80%931919&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Huang%2C+Belinda&amp;isbn=9781109252873&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Ethnic NewsWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Migratory trajectories: Moroccan borderlands and translocal imaginaries,"The creation of the E.U., a polymorphous political, economic and ideological space, has transformed and distended European states’ national borders. This Europeanization of national borders has made all E.U. borders equally appealing to migrants and refugees. Instead of détente in movement and flow, E.U. borders became increasingly militarized and E.U. states increasingly securitarian in their approach to migration. One of the most problematic consequences of this state of affairs is the rise in irregular migration. Based on research conducted in Morocco in 2005-2007, this dissertation explores irregular migration as a set of organized and chaotic (creative, unexpected) actions. I understand migration as an act without a finite beginning or a finite end, fluid, non-linear. At the center of this act is desire —desire for something else, somewhere other. This desire takes root in the individual and social imaginary and often transforms into obsession. But the word obsession’ begs its grounding in what is partially its opposite: the banal, the quotidian, the culturally mechanical. The desire to migrate structures and permeates the everyday: it affects the perceived value of the work produced and profoundly transforms concepts of space and time. Further, it invades conversations, participates in radical changes in patriarchal, gendered relations and in relations with returning immigrants. I suggest that (irregular) migration is both structural and intensely individual. Irregular migration, a global phenomenon on the rise, unwanted by host and transit states, is shaped by blocks, indefinite stops, liminalities and barriers. This leads me to question theoretical approaches to migration as constituted of flow and movement. Consequently, I concentrate on the disjunctive and derivate spaces created by irregular migration. I also come to understand that there is no finite, polished understanding of irregular migration as migrant treks and trajectories both create and are created by structural and collateral conditions. A new phenomenon has appeared. A transit country to Europe for many migrants from Subsaharan Africa and, increasingly for the Middle East and the Subcontinent, Morocco has become a host country due to the sheer difficulty of border crossings. Many economic and political refugees have trekked, often on foot and for months on end, across vast No Man’s Lands in the hope of reaching Europe. They may remain in transit for 5, 7 years. Morocco, an emitting country, has become an immigrant country—a fact both the Moroccan state and the Subsaharan Africans refuse to acknowledge. Finally, irregular migration has become an economic enterprise rooted in the individual and global imaginary and based on self-sacrifice. Though migration cannot be separated from larger socio-capitalist structures and necessities, I argue that it is also a daily practice, alive, both creative and nihilist. Basing my research in different regions and among different groups, I problematize the notion of ‘type’ of migration and think through how different ‘types’ are produced by cultural imaginaries and translocal lives.",304986137,,Dissertations & Theses," Alaoui, Oum-HaniAlaouiOum-HaniAlaoui, Oum-Hani",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1830105961 , 44005001 , 66569 , 9781109252774 , 3364525 , 3364525", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109252774, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304986137?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," Cultural anthropology , Political science , Public policy"," Social sciences , Borders , Ethnography , Migration , Morocco , Stasis , Sub-Saharan Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Migratory+trajectories%3A+Moroccan+borderlands+and+translocal+imaginaries&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alaoui%2C+Oum-Hani&amp;isbn=9781109252774&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Science, technology and utopias in the work of contemporary women artists","This dissertation examines the work of artists Alice Aycock, Agnes Denes, Martha Rolser and Carolee Schneemann, created between the late 1960s and the mid-1980s, which incorporated science and technology as subject and media. It represents the first focused examination of the conceptual use of science and technology by American women artists during the Cold War. I argue that, for these artists, science and technology represented a realm of investigation replete with negative associations in the wake of the Vietnam War, but also ripe with opportunities for change. Motivated by the contemporary American women’s movement, these artists leveraged theories in physics, cosmology and systems, as well as new technologies such as video, in order to subvert modernist, male-centered, heroic, painterly styles, in addition to the traditional economic structures of the gallery, museum and dealer. This study sheds new light on conceptual art by re-centering the use of technology, generally treated as a conservative trend and excised from avant-garde histories, as a means for critique of Cold War society and as a method for imagining alternative concepts of human community. At stake in this investigation are domains of knowledge and power from which women have been historically excluded. Informed by New Left and counter-culture criticism of nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War arising from influential theorists, such as Herbert Marcuse and Lewis Mumford, these artists associated the industries of science and technology with the military-industrial complex, which was reviled as representative of a closed, mechanistic “technological society.” However Marcuse, the media-acknowledged guru of the New Left (a left-wing international movement composed of social activist groups formed in the 1960s), also inspired the counter-culture to imagine an alternative society in which “science and technology are the great vehicles of liberation.” Thus, while these artists subjected the patriarchal institutions and industries of science and technology to withering attack, they also redeployed their implicit notion of progress in feminist utopian visions of a different future.",304988492,,Dissertations & Theses," Filippone, ChristineFilipponeChristineFilippone, Christine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1907210961 , 49613041 , 66569 , 9781109458909 , 3379138 , 3379138", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109458909, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304988492?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0377 Art history , 0453 Womens studies"," Art history , Womens studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Aycock, Alice , Cold War , Conceptual art , Denes, Agnes , Earthworks , Ecological art , Entropy , Feminism , Feminist art , Feminist utopianism , Gender , Labyrinth , Land art , Negentropy , Roster, Michael , Schneemann, Carolee , Science , Technology , Utopia , Vietnam War",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Science%2C+technology+and+utopias+in+the+work+of+contemporary%0Awomen+artists&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Filippone%2C+Christine&amp;isbn=9781109458909&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""From illegal to organic: Fair trade-organic tea production and women's political futures in Darjeeling, India","My dissertation is an ethnographic engagement with the localized effects of emerging global ethical regimes like Fair Trade. It explores the meaning and materiality of Fair Trade as it unfolds among women producers in Darjeeling's tea industry. It looks at how the specifics of agricultural commodity production premised on organic and Fair Trade stipulations can influence the bargaining power of marginalized women producers in formal and informal production settings. Grounded in anthropological theory and methods, this project contributes to recent debates among feminist scholars on issues of work under neoliberal production systems and women's political agency, interdisciplinary research on global alternative trade, south Asian labor ethnographies and scholarship on social justice. While Fair Trade-organic production is looked upon by its founders, activists, and participating NGOs as an antidote to the problems of corporate globalization, this project investigates such optimism ethnographically by examining whether Fair Trade is indeed effective for marginal producer groups, and if so, under what conditions this is the case. To do so, my dissertation compares how engagement with the Fair Trade movement has influenced the autonomy and livelihoods of two different groups of women working in the Fair Trade organic tea industry in Darjeeling, India—plantation workers and small scale farmers. I found that women tea farmers (independent farmers growing organic tea in their own land) tend to be more politically active than women plantation workers (wage laborers), even though the plantation workers have a long history of labor activism. My in-depth ethnographic research shows that women tea farmers are more effective in connecting their struggles against economic and cultural domination to the goals of the Fair Trade movement. They become more active in community affairs and undertake new business ventures by combating middlemen. In contrast, women plantation workers, despite their prior labor activism, are relatively incapable of mobilizing the Fair Trade movement to their own benefit, in spite of having their own informal networks. Key reasons for the difference include the different institutional structures of collective bargaining, access to resources (land), existing gender ideologies of work, and gendered community histories of political involvement in previous movements.",304991023,,Dissertations & Theses," Sen, DebaratiSenDebaratiSen, Debarati",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1953652331 , 42620151 , 66569 , 9781109530506 , 3387183 , 3387183", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109530506, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304991023?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Activism , Darjeeling , Fair trade , India , Organic tea , Plantation workers , Tea production , Women , Women tea farmers , Women's political activism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+illegal+to+organic%3A+Fair+trade-organic+tea+production+and+women%27s+political+futures+in+Darjeeling%2C+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sen%2C+Debarati&amp;isbn=9781109530506&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Expose, impel, and sustain change: The committed documentary in political life","In Expose, Impel, and Sustain Change: The Committed Documentary In Political Life the author explores the history and practice of politically ‘committed’ documentary filmmaking.

S. Naipaul, and Gao Xingjian. I approach these writers following a chronological order in which the travelers and the travel scenes in their works showcase five historical segments: late nineteenth-century (Henry James), post-WW I &amp; II (Kazuo Ishiguro), decolonization in the 1970s (V. S. Naipaul), the post-Chinese Cultural Revolution period, and late twentieth-century (Gao Xingjian). These are turning points in history that allow us to reconsider struggles for individual identity vis-à-vis transnational, cross-cultural, postcolonial, and post-national identities. This dissertation explores the hermeneutics of travel as a movement, a space, an act of creativity, a sense of displacement, an opportunity to remember the past, or a way of living. I investigate the restrictions and problems that fictional characters encounter in their transnational or cross-cultural travels. The rise of nationalism after the American and French Revolutions created powerful political forces that transformed personal understanding of individual and collective identity. During the nineteenth century, the influence of nationalism has penetrated all over Europe, and by the twentieth century, nationalist sentiments began to emerge in Asia and in Africa. In addition, this is a period of time in which the influences of imperialism, Western industrialization, the World Wars, decolonization, and international networking of commerce, media, and technology have intensified the complexity of “similarities” and “differences” among humans. In the literatures I examine, travel is associated with experiences of solitude and loneliness. While traveling brings out heterogeneous cultural and personal implications, links between historical events and memories have been broken into fragments that the characters are forced to be excluded from their former stable understanding of their selfhoods and sense of belongingness. Through observations and interrogations of the congruency of one’s political, cultural, social, ethnic, or linguistic identities with one’s national identity and individuality, a traveler discovers or reconfirms his or her personal identity; yet, this self-interpretation is not necessarily in alignment with their collective identities, and thereby creating argumentative languages. These languages are articulated to show the limits and possibilities of approaching unique constructions of one’s subjectivity. Henry James and Kazuo Ishiguro’s works illustrate the American and British nationalistic supremacy. When challenged by class hierarchy or social practice from another nation, James’s and Ishiguro’s characters are hypocritical and inhumanly rigid. By contrast, V. S. Naipaul and Gao Xingjian’s works convey senses of melancholia and isolation caused by their constant movements. Traveling, as an in-between status, initiates a period of time for the illusionary sense of singular identity be consolidated or discontinued. Traveling opens spaces in which the characters are allowed to inaugurate a more navigable arena for plural affiliations when they remain in alignment with their individuality. Chapter One of this dissertation, “Travel and the Construction of Identity: Henry James’s The American and The Portrait of a Lady ” discusses the contrast between Self/Other through the acts of travel. This contrast affects James’s characters’ individual performances within the relocated societies, thereby leading to a heightened anxiety over their national identity. Chapter Two, “Remembrance of Things in Travel: Self-Fabricated Identity in Kazuo Ishiguro’s The Remains of the Day and When We Were Orphans ,” explores how travel challenges the acceptance or denial of past memories. Travel for Ishiguro’s male characters is class-related. Within their comfort zones, they travel to rediscover themselves but when their national and subjective positions encounter the requirements to readjust their senses of belonging, they become reserved and retreat to their professional roles. Chapter three, “Travel and Nomadic Identity: V. S. Naipaul’s A Bend in the River ,” intends to explain nomadic identity as a revolting struggle against the notion of “settlement” in the postcolonial Zaire as well as how a detached or disengaged position of a nomad inquires into personal identity in the decolonized African town and the postcolonial center as London represents in this novel. Chapter Four, “Travel as a means to Individual Freedom: Gao Xingjian’s One Man’s Bible and Soul Mountain ,” analyzes the depth of personal identity. In their journeys, the protagonists are mobilized in order to seek detachment from any normative designations of identity.",304994174,,Dissertations & Theses," Wu, Pei-JuWuPei-JuWu, Pei-Ju",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1728106991 , 42081811 , 66569 , 9781109108392 , 3352744 , 3352744", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109108392, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304994174?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Comparative literature , Asian literature , American literature , British and Irish literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Literary imagination , Mobility , Space , Subjectivity , Transnational identity , Travel",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Literary+imaginings+of+transnational+identities%3A+Travel+in+modern+novels&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wu%2C+Pei-Ju&amp;isbn=9781109108392&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""!La unión hace la fuerza!""

It argues that their sense of community, identity, and ideology has evolved due to internal strife, immigration, and international solidarity. Chicana and Chicana student activists created MEChA as a network of activism dedicated to institutional reform, social justice, and Chicano liberation. Marxist-Leninism made major inroads into MEChA after the decline of Chicano Movement, but nationalism made a resurgence with the end of the Cold War.

A social movement history, the dissertation draws on organizational archives, periodicals, memoirs and collected oral histories, and ephemera to closely consider queer radicals’ political language, ideological debates, and activist work. Moving across an era marked at its outset by the founding of the Black Panther Party (1966) and at its end by the defeat of the Nicaraguan Revolution (1990), the study reveals the transformative meanings that racial militancy, national liberation, and international solidarity held for radical sexual politics in the latter half of the Cold War. Queer radicals drew ideas and inspiration from sources including the Third World Left and Marxist-Leninism, socialist feminism and women of color feminism, and the Latin American left. They used anti-imperialism to define sexual liberation, build activist coalition, and remake local queer community. More broadly, they used anti-imperialism to construct a politics of alliance and a discourse of lesbian and gay space. But queer anti-imperialism also held contradictions. Claims on space carried implicit ties to white and U.S. privilege; calls for alliance rested on solidarity with national liberation projects that often rejected queer identities. Imagining Alliance details how activists understood and sought to resolve these contradictions within the local landscapes of California and during three successive phases of queer politics: the gay liberation era (1966-1973); the gay and lesbian left (1973-1980); and lesbian and gay solidarity with Central America (1979-1990). Queer of color activists, especially lesbians of color, became central actors in critiquing both gay and straight nationalisms and in analyzing the intersections of sexuality and race in structures of global capital and U.S. power. Imagining Alliance identifies the story of queer anti-imperialism as central in narrating a more multiracial and transnational queer history, as well as for fully integrating questions of sexuality into analyses of the ""long 1960s"" and their legacies through the 1980s and today.",304997246,,Dissertations & Theses," Hobson, Emily K.HobsonK.EmilyHobson, Emily K.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1852576291 , 48272961 , 66569 , 9781109292749 , 3368549 , 3368549", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109292749, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/304997246?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0733 Gender studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0733 Gender studies",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0733 Gender studies"," American studies , American history , Gender studies"," Social sciences , 1960s , Anti-imperialism , California , Gay , Lesbian , Queer , Race , Radicalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Imagining+alliance%3A+Queer+anti-imperialism+and+race+in+California%2C+1966%E2%80%931990&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hobson%2C+Emily+K.&amp;isbn=9781109292749&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Perspectives on the public health implications of global climate change and the epidemiology of vector-borne disease,"Global climate change is becoming an increasing concern among the public health community.

With these geographic, meteorological, and social changes come increased threats to human health. One of these threats is the spread of vector-borne infectious diseases. The changes mentioned above are believed to contribute to increased arthropod survival, transmission, and habitation. These changes, in turn, lead to increased incidence among neighboring human populations. It is also argued that human action may play more of a role than climate change.

In theory, disclosure regulation can have important normative influence on corporate behavior, because it acts like a 'risk virus' injected into the corporate decision-making matrix that companies will seek to manage and control. The challenge for regulators is to identity the scope of disclosure that will cause corporate responses of the sort desired by the state. This dissertation considers the potential role of disclosure regulation as a tool for influencing labour practices beyond the borders of the regulating state and, in particular, within the vast global supply chains of multinational corporations. The emergence of a new activist movement concerned with supply chain labour practices has elevated the risk to brand-based companies of being associated with abusive labour conditions. That risk might be exploited by disclosure regulation that aims to 'encourage' companies to pay greater attention to the conditions of work under which their products are produced. But this legal strategy is controversial and wrought with dangers; it can intrude on domestic labour policies and leave workers worse off than before. The goal of the regulation must be foremost the empowerment of the workers and their organizations in those states and the indigenous and emerging global social movements who assist them. Drawing on a qualitative examination of two major apparel corporations—Nike and Levi-Strauss—that have slowly embraced supply chain transparency, this dissertation presents an argument that mandatory factory disclosure could make a useful contribution to this goal of reducing labour abuses within global supply chains.",305037617,,Dissertations & Theses," Doorey, David J.DooreyJ.DavidDoorey, David J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1883612151 , 48951171 , 66569 , 9780494516973 , NR51697 , NR51697", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494516973, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305037617?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0616 International law"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law"," 0398 Law , 0616 International law",," 0398 Law , 0616 International law"," Law , International law"," Social sciences , Apparel corporations , Disclosure regulation , Labor practices , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+domestic+labour+regulation%3A+Using+domestic+disclosure+regulation+to+influence+foreign+labour+practices&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Doorey%2C+David+J.&amp;isbn=9780494516973&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""‘Random murder by technology’: The role of scientific and biomedical experts in the anti -nuclear movement, 1969–1992","This dissertation analyzes the work of activist-oriented American physicians and scientists in the late 1960s, assessing how they challenged policy makers to seriously address the risks associated with nuclear power and nuclear weapons technology between 1969 and 1992. Specifically, this project focuses on the activities of Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS), Physicians for Social Responsibility (PSR), International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War (IPPNW), and Rosalie Bertell, who worked under the auspices of three organizations—the Ministry of Concern for Public Health (MCPH), the Jesuit Centre for Social Faith and Research (JCSFR), and the International Institute of Concern for Public Health (IICPH). All of these non-profit organizations were founded during the third wave of the anti-nuclear movement—UCS in 1969, PSR in 1979, IPPNW in 1981, MCPH and JCSFR in 1978, and IICPH in 1983. They fit neatly into sociologist, Scott Frickel's definition of ""public interest science organizations,"" which are ""distinguished by their explicit mission to seek ways to use science for the benefit of the public and by their connections to political movements."" As well, the scientific and technological concerns of each of these organizations were all somehow related to the public health and/or environmental consequences of nuclear technology. The dissertation argues that the pre-existing hierarchy in the sciences (where physics and engineering were favoured over 'softer' sciences like medicine and epidemiology), the ways that gender ideology shaped the practice of science, and the tendency of the nuclear bureaucracy and the American media to feminize the work of social activists uniquely influenced the approach to activism within each of these groups. These same factors (as well as the relative size of each organization) structured the evolution of each group's understanding of nuclear risks.",305039706,,Dissertations & Theses," Rumiel, Lisa A.RumielA.LisaRumiel, Lisa A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1935395931 , 50160491 , 66569 , 9780494541043 , NR54104 , NR54104", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494541043, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305039706?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history"," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history"," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history",," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history"," American history , Economic history"," Social sciences , Anti-nuclear movement , Bertell, Rosalie , International Institute of Concern for Public Health , International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War , Jesuit Centre for Social Faith and Research , Ministry of Concern for Public Health , Physicians for Social Responsibility , Union of Concerned Scientists",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%98Random+murder+by+technology%E2%80%99%3A+The+role%0Aof+scientific+and+biomedical+experts+in+the+anti+-nuclear+movement%2C+1969%E2%80%931992&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rumiel%2C+Lisa+A.&amp;isbn=9780494541043&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Poetries of geography in postwar America,"With the publication of Elizabeth Bishop's North &amp; South (1946) and Charles Olson's Call Me Ishmael (1947), geography emerged as a major source of material and metaphor for American poetry. This dissertation, “Poetries of Geography in Postwar America,” turns on the unexpected convergence of literary projects as different as these two first books. Olson and Bishop's attention to space and its representation issues from a common need to reconcile the many scales geography includes: from local surroundings, to continents and oceans, to the planet in its entirety. After World War II brought a new awareness of global geography to the U.S. public, the individual's sense of inhabiting multiple and shifting scales of both space and society became one of the period's defining problems. Writers responded by seeking new kinds of expression that would figure imagined expanses as well as observed scenes, social belonging as well as private experience. Chapters on four poets writing after modernism—Olson, Bishop, A. R. Ammons, and John Ashbery—consider literary form as a way of thinking across different orders of magnitude. These writers use geographic themes to revise the modernist focus on literary autonomy, aiming instead for continual re-involvement with the world. The stylistic consequence of their broadened attention is a middle register of language between particularity and abstraction, an alternative to both the biographical experience and the linguistic play that guided other literary movements of the period. These writers are drawn to this middle register because it can encourage a sense, but often no more than a sense, of human connection. The widened scopes of vision that evoke ideas of society also keep those ideas general, and social experience enters their poems as imagined experience, without the specificity of actual encounter. The difficulty of knowing others and the unreality of imagined relationships become these poets' recurring concerns.",305041631,,Dissertations & Theses," Hollister, Susannah LangHollisterLangSusannahHollister, Susannah Lang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1852385061 , 48353751 , 66569 , 9781109210019 , 3362178 , 3362178", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109210019, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305041631?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature",," 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature"," Modern literature , American literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Ammons, A.

Morales was (and still is) the leader of Bolivia's most influential coca-growers union, the Six Federations of the Cochabamba Tropics, and he identifies as an indigenous peasant. The coca-growers' unions are comprised of ex-miners who relocated to the Chapare region of Bolivia to pursue coca growing as an economic alternative when the mining industry crashed in the 1980s and they have since become one of the most powerful unions in Bolivia. The restructuring of society and the redefinition of coca policies in the current global political climate is proving to be a challenging feat. This thesis looks at the intersection between social movements and the state, by examining the cocalero movement in Bolivia and their transition into state power. I ask to what extent changes can be made within, and outside of, the state system. I conclude with the argument that working towards specific demands through the state, and thereby focusing on constitutional or policy changes, perpetuates the liberal notion of democracy and representation that actually impedes the real involvement of all citizens. This trajectory does not fully challenge the fundamental roots of injustice, and at the end of the day state reforms that ensue — no matter how progressive they appear — may face, and/or perpetuate, limitations in a struggle for fundamental changes that seek to eradicate the root causes of inequality.",305043327,,Dissertations & Theses," Day, AngelaDayAngelaDay, Angela",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1866204151 , 48411281 , 66569 , 9780494501870 , MR50187 , MR50187", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494501870, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305043327?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+the+streets+to+the+state%3A+An+analysis+of+Bolivia%27s+cocaleros+as+a+movement+for+social+change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Day%2C+Angela&amp;isbn=9780494501870&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Rhythmanalysis of Critical Mass: A meeting place,"Critical Mass is a globally amorphous celebration of bicycling in public space that started in September 1992, in San Francisco (Carlsson 2002a, 5–6).

We just do, do, and do! We do whatever is expected of us, without ever asking ourselves: ‘do we want to be doing it? should we be doing it?’ ” When I asked if she was referring to the grant she explained: “Well, projects give us funding and fame. We try to give this place continuity as a political subject and to be present on the territory. But in here? We’ re in crisis! Just look! We’re becoming a service agency, worse a court of miracles! We’re forgetting where we came from!” - as she pointed to the line of immigrant women waiting for an appointment. Yet the names of the Alma Mater Center and the Almaterra Association of Native and Migrant Women were all a buzz that year in political circuits of the Center–Left precisely for their role in projects funded by and adhering to European policy programs promoting a “new welfare society.” Could it be that the seductively alienating “expectations” Alma activists ‘simply could not say no to’ were not only those of migrant women with no other place to turn under Italy’s right–wing turn? Could it be that the answer lay somewhere in between the gaze onto those waiting in the hall, the grant application in hand, and social democrats’ accolades? Taking as its theoretical background a set of conversations on globalization, new social movements, and radical democracy this dissertation thus seeks to contribute to understandings of the (im)possibilities of critical politics in the “global age,” by inquiring into the strength of the neo–liberal where one would least expect. In fact, through the experience of “third sector” institutionalization of the Almaterra Association, a site of intercultural feminism and radical humanism born in 1989, it suggests that one of the driving forces of neo–liberalism has been precisely social democrats’ pursuit of “renewal” via a Third Way project — and that this project derives its social and cultural power from: (a) the attempt to commensurate discourses and imaginations of deep democracy, public welfare, and social cohesion both to market logics of risk–calculus, speculative investment and efficient productivity and to liberal fantasies of entrepreneurial emancipation and non–conflictual society, and from (b) the framing of this operation as the post–ideological and post–modern imperative of what I call realist pragmatism . I suggest that Alma activists’ self-fixated gaze on tensions that afford ‘no way out’ is symptomatic of fear and desire to acknowledge the imbrications of Italian and European social policy with neo–liberal fantasies and of the experience of this simultaneously alluring and repelling knowledge as containing both a promise of critical awareness and the risk of subjective collapse. More precisely, I suggest that frequent invocations of “crisis,” “schizophrenia,” “insanity” and their attendant pragmatics of “forgetting,” like Paola’s, name (however indirectly) the experience of contradiction as a condition of fascination with the “post–ideological” culture of post–modernity that the Center–Left has intercepted and tried to rationalize and socialize as a Third Way in governance “beyond left and right.” And I work to show that this state of liminal suspension at the doorstep of critical (mis)recognition informs a posture of resistant complicity and complicit resistance that affords possibilities of critique on the far side of ‘deception.’",305051934,,Dissertations & Theses," Colombi, AliceColombiAliceColombi, Alice",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1858689681 , 47238811 , 66569 , 9781109312935 , 3369320 , 3369320", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109312935, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305051934?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0453 Womens studies , 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies"," Cultural anthropology , Womens studies , Public policy , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Feminism , Interculturality , Italy , New welfare , Third way , Transnational migrations , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+dialectic+of+fascination%3A+Intercultural+feminism+and+third%0Away+welfare+in+contemporary+Italy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Colombi%2C+Alice&amp;isbn=9781109312935&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Beyond the ethnonational divide: Identity politics and women in Northern Ireland and Israel/Palestine,"Beyond the Ethnonational Divide: Identity Politics and Women in Northern Ireland and Israel/Palestine is a comparative analysis of the conflict resolution processes and peace-building strategies employed in Northern Ireland and Israel/Palestine, focusing on the experiences of women's feminist peace movements. I draw on feminist thought in the international relations and comparative politics literatures, as well as the critical identity politics literatures developed outside these fields, to demonstrate the value of broadening our understanding of social identity in conflict. In particular, I apply a post-positivist realist approach to identity to evaluate the extent to which women's feminist peace communities develop untested ideas related to conflict resolution and peace-building in these cases. I argue that the dominant ethnonational conflict resolution literature, developed largely within the comparative politics field, advances an ‘elite accommodation’ strategy for resolving conflict that grants the most militant and sometimes violent ethnonational leaders the authority to speak for the body public during transformative constitutional moments. I propose that conflict resolution schemes that privilege ethnonational elite political figures and treat the interests of all actors in intrastate conflict as fundamentally derived from ethnonational interests do not produce a stable post-conflict period of peace and governance, they fail to secure human rights, equality guarantees and justice provisions for all communities in a post-conflict period, and they fail to capitalize on the local, participant knowledge and alternate visions of conflict resolution and peace that are developed in “subaltern” identity-based communities. In my view, when we consider the genesis and development of the feminist peace movements in Israel/Palestine and Northern Ireland, we can see how a politics based on solidarity and alliances, across ethnic, national, gender, class and sexuality divides, is informed by the endogenous conditions of conflict and also the exogenous development of transnational feminist theory and praxis. The negotiation of identity in women's feminist peace communities has been complex and, at times, difficult. However, it has also led to the development of novel ideas related to peace, inclusion, human rights and justice that have been sidelined, to varying degrees, in the conflict resolution processes in both cases.",305054738,,Dissertations & Theses," Byrne, SiobhanByrneSiobhanByrne, Siobhan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1720963351 , 42540891 , 66569 , 9780494482117 , NR48211 , NR48211", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494482117, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305054738?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law",," 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," Womens studies , Political science , International law , Social identity , Northern Ireland , Israel , Palestinian territory"," Social sciences , Conflict resolution , Feminism , Identity politics , Israel , Northern Ireland , Palestine , Peace movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Beyond+the+ethnonational+divide%3A+Identity+politics+and+women+in+Northern+Ireland+and+Israel%2FPalestine&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Byrne%2C+Siobhan&amp;isbn=9780494482117&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Mining wars: Corporate expansion and labor violence in the Western desert, 1876-1920","This dissertation analyzes the class struggle in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries in Mexico and the western United States to illuminate the social transformation taking place in this trans-national region. The US and Mexico both underwent a significant metamorphosis in this era. The creation of a labor based working class and the displacement of occupational professionals from the upper class in many communities into an emerging middle class disrupted traditional social structures in both nations. This systematic social change, occurring nearly simultaneously in the US and Mexico, was complicated by the emerging system of monopoly capitalism, which led to a new form of trans-national ideological, political, and economic struggle between social classes. While the emergence of monopoly capitalism brought social transformation, it also resulted in new political challenges as conservatives, moderates, and radicals in the middle- and upper-classes struggled for political and economic control in both nations. In the US, social struggles led to the Populist movement, Progressivism, and increased radicalization of labor unions such as the International Workers of the World and the Western Federation of Miners, while at the same time, labor unions, clerical groups, Indian farmers, moderate landowners, and anarchists, fought in Mexico against Porfirio Díaz and foreign corporations. The transformation of Mexican capitalism began as early as 1857 with the creation of its Liberal Constitution. Under this constitution the Liberals in Mexico privatized communal and church lands, through laws such as the Ley Lerdo, strengthening their economic and political control across Mexico. The economic restructuring of Mexico during the Díaz administration, however, increased this redistribution of power, displacing the wealthy landowners and increasing the influence of foreign investors, primarily from the United States. The end of the nineteenth century was a time of great change for the United States as well. Essentially independent of each other for most of the nineteenth century, the eastern and western United States began to merge politically, economically, and socially in the Progressive Era. Greatly fueled by investments from the eastern US, corporate mines, ranches, and farms spread through the West with growing railroad and telegraph companies connecting America's many island communities. Traditional community leaders were displaced as the national economy grew more interconnected and industrial leaders grew more powerful both nationally and internationally. To better understand the social changes in the US and Mexico as industry giants dominated these nations at the turn of the nineteenth century, this trans-national analysis of labor struggles from 1876-1920 will examine the social struggles within these industrializing nations. Though these regions are often treated separately by scholars, the similarities of the struggles that took place in both of them indicates a common and connected series of social transformations. This trans-national emphasis highlights the shortcomings of the traditional regional and national models that have marked scholarship on the American West and Mexico. As the first truly trans-national study of the labor wars that erupted in the US and Mexico from 1876-1920 this dissertation draws on a wide range of more readily available secondary literature on mining labor and labor violence in the US West and Mexico. This secondary literature, while voluminous, has, for the most part, occupied separate streams, primarily divided by the international border artificially drawn through the western desert. The aim of “Mining Wars” is to bring these stories together, to show how they illuminate one another and in doing so provide a larger narrative of the relationships between business and labor in a larger region of the American continent that cuts across the international borderline. The early twenty-first century, as US-Mexican border issues – including strict enforcement of the US law through increased border patrols and Congressional debates over the status of the up to twelve million Mexicans currently residing in the US without official papers (sans papales) – is an opportune time to remind ourselves of the vital interconnectedness of the two nationally separate parts of this border region.

Through a case study on the legislative process of the three Violence Against Women (VAW) Acts in South Korea, this study focuses on why each kind of VAW issue grasped the public's attention at a certain point in time and why each policy-making process was dominated by the NGOs. It also explores how the process unfolded and what factors influenced it. This study shows that the existing policy process theories, represented by the Kingdon's multiple streams theory and the Baumgartner &amp; Jones' Punctuated Equilibrium theory, reveal some limitations, although they are helpful in presenting the holistic approach to the policy process. These limitations include less attention (or none at all) to the global influences or the role of the NGOs. Although Baumgartner &amp; Jones pay attention to the role of the Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs), their role is generally confined to directing the attention of the government to a public issue. Therefore, to address these limitations, the conceptual framework of this study incorporates the theories of social movement, state feminism, constructivism, policy transfer. Through this modified conceptual framework, this study shows that in each legislative process of the three VAW Acts, women's groups were indeed policy entrepreneurs who were engaged in a variety of activities in support of the new VAW legislations. In addition, this study clearly demonstrates that transnational influences played a significant role in each legislative process. However, the analysis on the policy process alone cannot answer the question of why governments' responses to the VAW issues and the involvement of the women's groups have showed a great variance among countries around the world. For example, some countries are quite responsive to the transnational influences, while others are very reluctant to make a move. The influence of the women's groups is stronger in some countries than in others, and the range of the influences varies in terms of the kinds of gender policies. This study pays keen attention to the role of the Women's Policy Machinery (WPM) in the gender policy process as a factor in bridging these differences. This study shows that even the enabling environment fostered by the favorable political opportunities—domestic or international—cannot guarantee the successful enactment of the VAW Acts without the deliberate and intentional mobilization by the WPM. The impact that the WPM and the women's groups have exerted on the policy process has been strongly associated with the organizational power of the WPM. The stronger the organizational power of the WPM is, the more powerful the impact has become. In this sense, if a country tries to promote the advancement of women or gender equality, it needs to pay attention to the strengthening of the WPM in the beginning. However, this dissertation suggests that the WPM can make negative influences on the policy process because it plays another kind of an interest group with its own interests in mind. Therefore, there should be a forum where diverse interests or opinions on a public issue can be freely raised and coordinated.",305084051,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, Jeong-ShimLeeJeong-ShimLee, Jeong-Shim",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1913184361 , 49551691 , 66569 , 9781109506853 , 3385831 , 3385831", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109506853, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305084051?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0617 Public administration"," 0453 Womens studies , 0617 Public administration"," 0453 Womens studies , 0617 Public administration",," 0453 Womens studies , 0617 Public administration"," Womens studies , Public administration , Gender , Policy making , Domestic violence , South Korea"," Social sciences , Gender policymaking , Korea , Policy process , Policymaking , Violence against women , Women's policy machinery",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Process+dynamics+of+gender+policymaking%3A+Acts+of+violence+against+women+in+South+Korea&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Jeong-Shim&amp;isbn=9781109506853&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Privatization and limits to economic liberalization in Turkey: ERDEMIR case study,"Compared to many of her counterparts, which started their privatization adventure at similar levels of economic development, Turkey’s experience with privatization was extraordinarily protracted. Only by the turn of the millennium did the course of Turkey’s exceptionally delayed privatization begin to change. Against this background, the dissertation utilizes privatization as an analytical tool to revisit the debate regarding the place and role of the state in economy and society, in a distinctive historical juncture when the shift from a state-directed economic model to a market-economy model disrupts, dissolves and recasts existing relationships between social groups and the state in Turkey. By focusing on one instance of the privatization process, the privatization of Eregli Iron and Steel Works (ERDEMIR), the study demonstrates three definitive moments in Turkey in regard to the course of instituting economic liberalism in general, and accomplishing privatization in particular: First, the anti-privatization movement in Turkey was empowered by a strong nationalist ideology which served as a catalyst to an encompassing and passionate state-building, nation-making and bourgeoisie-creating project since the inception of the Republic. As such, opposition to privatization was never a plain backlash to a new economic strategy that has been put in effect since the early 1980s, but a recent reincarnation of a deeper ideological stance informed by an etatist outlook and defensive nationalism. Second, the renewed trajectory of privatization after 2000 towards an astonishing level was not solely a consequence of favorable domestic and international economic conditions, but rather was a symptom of the impact of global level shifts in the neoliberal ideology which weakened the etatist discourse and national development outlook in Turkey. It was at a historical juncture when this revived ideology found recipients among those political and economic elite in Turkey who, for various reasons, had long been in conflict with the existing configuration of the state and the interpretation of etatism, and were ready to implement the requirements of the new economic order more enthusiastically and successfully than previous political groups. Finally, despite what can be portrayed as miraculous achievements in privatization in recent years, the strong nationalist ideology, deeply rooted in the historical development of state-society relations since the inception of the Republic, empowered the alliance of oppositional groups, who could at times, as the ERDEMIR case demonstrates, successfully deflect the course of privatization, and make sure that ‘nationalist sensitivities’ were respected.",305108191,,Dissertations & Theses," Agartan, KaanAgartanKaanAgartan, Kaan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1791777721 , 46875771 , 66569 , 9781109173475 , 3358705 , 3358705", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109173475, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305108191?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure,, 0700 Social structure, Social structure," Social sciences , Economic liberalization , Eregli Iron and Steel Works , Privatization , Steel industry , Turkey",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Privatization+and+limits+to+economic+liberalization+in+Turkey%3A+ERDEMIR+case+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Agartan%2C+Kaan&amp;isbn=9781109173475&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Indigenous pedagogies: An interpretive case study of Sinte Gleska and critical pedagogy,"The purpose of this case study is to examine the intersections between tribal college education and critical pedagogy.

In this regard, Indigenous education may have similarities to critical pedagogy. From a global perspective, Indigenous people need to claim their rightful place in the educational discourse.

In this dissertation, I examine works from six authors whose writing reflects the scope of this trend and I argue for a consideration of their collective impact on our social imaginary. The bulk of my argument is devoted to an examination of the Catholic religious content in the five novels and one memoir: David Adams Richards' Bay of Love and Sorrows (1998); Ann-Marie MacDonald's Fall on Your Knees (1996); Lynn Coady's Strange Heaven (1996); Wayne Johnston's Baltimore's Mansion: A Memoir (1999); Patrick Kavanagh's Gaff Topsails (1996); and Michael Crummey's The Wreckage (2005). These novels are indicative of what is more broadly referred to as the contemporary ""return of religion"" in Western discourse and politics. But what exactly does this revitalized religious discourse tell us? It is my contention that the rise of the Catholic novel in Atlantic Canada signals shifts in what we consider as the ""religious"" and the ""secular."" I offer an account of this shifting religious-secular dynamic in my introduction. While each of the works I study is unique, there are consistent theological constructs that are repeated through them all. I have called these consistencies a ""theological aesthetic."" They include: firstly, the analogy of being - a specific linguistic pattern for considering the similarities and differences between God and humanity; secondly, the spiritual sense - a way of reading Scripture which allows for figures and events to take on significance that resonates beyond the literal element of the text; and thirdly, gathered time - a description of the way that eternity relates to temporal beings. These three aspects of the theological aesthetic offer insight into contemporary Western understandings of the relations between the secular (nature) and the religious (grace). I argue that instead of putting the emphasis on the extreme difference between nature and grace, as was done by the influential Protestant movements that underwrote the earlier Atlantic Canadian imaginary, the current shifts have allowed for a more broadly defined nature-grace continuum. To understand this shift we require a fuller distinction between what I call ""Secular I"" (as described in most earlier secularization theories) and ""Secular II"" (now sometimes referred to as the ""post-secular""). In my final chapter, I offer an explanation of this shifting religious-secular dynamic through an historical overview of key texts in the Atlantic literary canon. I theorize the shift from a stable divide between the religious and the secular that was managed by a general Protestant ethos, to a more stringent privatization of religion. While many have naturalized the resulting secularism, I claim that this recent Catholic literary trend challenges our preconceived notions about what constitutes secular and religious contributions, and thus, frustrates any notion of purity on the side of the secular or the religious. Understood this way, the contemporary Catholic novel in Atlantic Canada, which could stereotypically be thought to express marginal concerns, reflects a post-secular innovation that represents a transnational critique of the Protestant structures that underpin our social imaginary.",305137068,,Dissertations & Theses," Atkinson, Andrew PeterAtkinsonPeterAndrewAtkinson, Andrew Peter",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1929682511 , 50035111 , 66569 , 9780494542545 , NR54254 , NR54254", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494542545, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305137068?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0318 Religion , 0352 Canadian literature , 0469 Theology"," 0298 Modern literature , 0318 Religion , 0352 Canadian literature , 0469 Theology"," 0298 Modern literature , 0318 Religion , 0352 Canadian literature , 0469 Theology",," 0298 Modern literature , 0318 Religion , 0352 Canadian literature , 0469 Theology"," Modern literature , Religion , Canadian literature , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Language, literature and linguistics , Atlantic Canada , Catholicism , Coady, Lynn , Crummey, Michael , Johnston, Wayne , Kavanagh, Patrick , Literary , MacDonald, Ann-Marie , Richards, David Adams",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Saltwater+sacraments+and+backwoods+sins%3A+Contemporary+Atlantic+Canadian+literature+and+the+rise+of+literary+Catholicism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Atkinson%2C+Andrew+Peter&amp;isbn=9780494542545&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Dedevelopment,"The state of the planet was briefly examined from economic, social, and environmental perspectives. The examination showed that the world has largely come under a single development paradigm and that the situation this paradigm has led us to is unsustainable and inequitable. There have been a number of efforts to set the planet on a different path to sustainability and social justice but so far they have failed to gain sufficient momentum to achieve change on a scale commensurate with the magnitude and urgency of the problem. The author contends that these efforts for change might be more effective if they could be united under a common, global theme or objective sharing common principles.

Using a direct analysis model, as well as principles of Peircean semiotic and rhetorical analysis, the recent discourses articulated by the anti-CSH movement (International Fund for Animal Welfare and Sea Shepherd Conservation Society) and the Canadian government (Department of Fisheries and Oceans) have been considered. The findings corroborate a social constructionist perception of nature, as the rhetorical discourse focused on presenting conflicting representations of the natural world, notably the seal. It was also found that the rhetorical discourse was centred on the subsidiary themes of the representation of the kill, the sealers, and the proponents and opponents of the CSH. The thesis also notes a complementary relationship between textuality and visuality within the CSH polemic, and finds the latter being abundantly used by the anti-CSH movement but comparatively absent from the Canadian government's strategy.",527729386,,Dissertations & Theses," Carrier-Lafontaine, ConstanceCarrier-LafontaineConstanceCarrier-Lafontaine, Constance",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2068963121 , 49163951 , 66569 , 9780494613146 , MR61314 , MR61314", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494613146, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/527729386?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0681 Rhetoric , 0708 Mass communications"," 0615 Political science , 0681 Rhetoric , 0708 Mass communications"," 0615 Political science , 0681 Rhetoric , 0708 Mass communications",," 0615 Political science , 0681 Rhetoric , 0708 Mass communications"," Political science , Rhetoric , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+representation+of+the+Canadian+seal+hunt%3A+Analysing+the+rhetorical+strategies+of+the+animal+rights+movement+and+the+Canadian+government&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Carrier-Lafontaine%2C+Constance&amp;isbn=9780494613146&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Opposition, discipline and culture: The civic world of the Irish and Italians in Philadelphia, 1880–1920","One of the stock assumptions that inhabits our understanding of the history of 19 th - and early 20 th -century immigration to an industrializing America is the wretchedness of the new immigrant laborers. Whatever progress the new ethnic groups achieved in cultural and civic matters was attributable to learning and adapting to American influence, a process of assimilation that instilled social discipline in personal and public life and an appreciation for American democracy. This study challenges this stock assumption and relocates the locus of investigation overseas, to transnational sources of civic life in the pre-emigration lands of Ireland and South/Central Italy to explain the rapid rise and proliferation of ethnic voluntary associations in the late 1800s, early 1900s. The empirical universe is the Irish and Italians of Philadelphia; the time frame is 1880-1920, and the social site of investigation and analysis is the vibrant community life of ethnic voluntary associations the Irish and Italians constructed. This study also challenges a reading of the Irish associations in Philadelphia as little more than neighborhood clubs peopled by an aspiring upper strata of the Irish American community reaching for bourgeois values. This work suggests that the associations were populated by the working class, many born in Ireland, that substituted an ethic of solidarity for individual achievement values, a communal opposition to symbols of past oppression and agents of privilege. The Irish Americans of Philadelphia had cultural advantages prior to emigration, and they capitalized on this stock of common knowledge absorbed in native Ireland to transfer the norms, methods and moral codes of behavior from the Irish Friendly Society to the Irish American Beneficial Association of Philadelphia. However closely the Irish of Philadelphia followed the original transatlantic model, they ultimately molded their own style of ethnic association that elevated humanitarian communal values and constructed their civic life on a scaffolding of stable financial reasoning backed by a solid group discipline. The region of Abruzzo in South/Central Italy sent a disproportionate share of its rural people to Philadelphia in a massive chain migration that formed the Italian colony of South Philadelphia in the early 1900s. The Abruzzesse were a mountainous people defined by their rocky hilltop topography and a hard heritage derived from eking out an existence working rocky soil or shepherding; this was a mobile population cultured in the tradition of seasonal migration within Europe as the small farmers and rural laborers often spent months away from home in search of work to support their family and home. The rural proletariat of Abruzzo that eventually settled in Philadelphia also arrived with a rich civic heritage firmly intact, and the Italians capitalized on their knowledge and experience of an advanced civic culture based in local mutual aid to establish beneficial associations in Italian Philadelphia. In the process of following transatlantic models and in creating their own life, these ethnic groups constructed a collective consciousness mediated through the immediate community and educational mission of the ethnic associations. For the Irish, the association became the protective institution for a world view that defined Irish identity within the Diaspora as a community of exiles torn from cherished rural locations, a people bent on maintaining a vigilant eye on enemies such as the occupying British state in Ireland, on Irish landlordism and anti-Catholic agents in America ever supportive of Irish nationalism. This consciousness grafted all kinds of imaginary symbols to its base, including race, a Social Darwinisitic rendering of the Celtic type as superior to the Anglo Saxon, and a matrix of factors that conflated social class, nationalism, and sentimental remembrance into a hard opposition leveled at all forms of illegitimate privilege. The Italians were a mobile people of the mountains loyal to family and land, schooled in the rigors of migration, backed by the civic institutions of self-help they constructed in their agricultural towns; they were not burdened by the weight of sentimental nationalism as the Irish were in their Diaspora. Yet, during Italy’s time of crisis during World War I, the Italian Americans of Philadelphia awakened national leanings and constructed a movement of national support for failing Italy. The Italian American associations of South Philadelphia came alive to sponsor financial and moral support for Italy at war, and a renewed Italian imperialism in the immediate post-war years. Thus, as the Irish and Italians drew on their old-world methods to create new civic institutions in Philadelphia, they also constructed separate ethnic identities and an active community, a vibrant energy that made industrial Philadelphia the home of the American voluntary association.

The use of hip hop as public performance has been the most recent occurrence in reclaiming a sense of free cultural expression and immediate communication and interactions with the public. Historically, U.S. hip hop, and the development of its four elements, DJ, breaking, MC, and graffiti, have encouraged street culture and public street performances as a way to reclaim public space, and inform on-lookers to the social inequalities produced with a spatial-temporal awareness (Baker, p. 218). Non-U.S. hip hop has not deviated from this phenomenon, and in many cases has significant, politicized hip hop movements that have flourished. Many Cuban and Brazilian rappers and artists are creating more provocative, street displays of expression that elucidate the contradictions of daily existence in marginalized, neglected communities. For this reason, Cuban and Brazilian hip hop both have the uniqueness of these incorporations and contradictions in hip hop expression, based on the fact that both Cuban and Brazilian governments are promoting hip hop culture. This dissertation examines the use of hip hop inspired street performance as both hidden and public transcript. James C. Scott in Domination and the Arts of Resistance defines these two terms as methods that are employed by power entities exercising control over discourse through cultural manifestation. The dissertation will be contextualized in this framework. What is of concern for this dissertation is how Afro-Cuban and Afro-Brazilian youth and other hip hop-influenced youth in these countries exert public spatial control under specific historic and contemporary circumstances where social contradictions are growing between whites and non-Whites, artists and governing bodies. I will utilize hip hop street culture and spoken word, performance art as a performative, corporal expression that has received financial support from the Cuban and Brazilian government, while at the same time has remained community-based in both countries. Nongovernmentally-supported hip hop street performance has allowed some artists the liberty to bypass cultural institutions and other avenues of official and national artistic recognition, for instance, seeking other benefactors to support their work. Despite this, artists, participators, and rappers are ""playing"" various political alliances and employing both hidden and public transcripts to benefit from the increasing support of the art form, and in the case of Alamar, Cuba and Salvador, Brazil performers, are producing socially ""conscious"" artistic manifestations in public places for specific audiences with specific intentions and objectives. In many cases these performers seek not only to produce personal art that usually has an activist intent that also benefits the government sponsored financial support of ""rebel"" music culture, but to also allay hidden transcripts to the communities in the audience who pick up on its subtleties. I will contextualize these ideas through an analysis of national identity and history, and how culture and identity have historically informed social justice and values in the racially and socially polarized societies of Havana/Alamar and Salvador. Hip hop will then be analyzed as a public resource (Yúdice, p. 9). Hip hop culture allows participating communities to share in the global public discourse of social transcendence and power (Pardue, Ideologies, p. 24). Public performance also arms artists with a wider arsenal of material. It also gives a sense to audience members that they are participating in a resource of social integration and increasing political momentum (Baker, p. 240). This dissertation will describe how Afro-Brazilian and Afro-Cuban communities use hip hop to publicly and creatively express their local concerns through a politics of culture in the commercial arena of ""the street"". This cultural politics is then incorporated into other affiliations with the state or socio-political movements and used for specific purposes within these two countries. Many artists negotiate with these institutions, while maintaining a cultural autonomy and a critical quality to their work.

Yet, although the international community, employing liberal approaches to peacebuilding, has made repeated attempts to end the civil war, all of the externally imposd solutions failed to establish neither durable peace nor a functioning state in Somalia. In 2006, heterogeneous local Islamist movements under the banner of the Union of Islamic Courts defeated Somali warlords and restored peace in Mogadishu and most of southern Somalia, thus surprising observers and the international community. Using a combination of post-colonialism and social constructivist paradigms and interviews and document analysis methodologies, this dissertation critically examines how some of the often excluded stakeholders such as Islamists, members from the business community, and nationalist intellectuals understand the challenges of and responses to building peace in Somalia. In-depth analysis of interviews, secondary documents, and observations reveal that there are four major challenges: two domestic and two external. The research finds that the divisive nature of clan identity and presence of a strong Islamist movement that attracts unwanted external meddling are the two major domestic challenges while American policy (actions or inactions) toward Somalia and Ethiopia's hostile meddling are the external factors that undermine previous peacebuilding efforts in Somalia. Moreover, the study identifies governance and education as the two long-term responses to the Somali conflict. The findings of this study are relevant for policymakers and peacemakers who are trying to establish durable peace in Somalia. Finally, contrary to the prevailing approach that focuses on clans, it is argued that traditionally ignored stakeholders (e.g., business leaders, Islamists, and intellectuals) are key to both theory building and peacebuilding.",858078975,,Dissertations & Theses," Elmi, Afyare AbdiElmiAbdiAfyareElmi, Afyare Abdi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2298939561 , 49093141 , 66569 , 9780494712191 , NR71219 , NR71219", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494712191, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/858078975?accountid=14496," 0563 Peace Studies , 0615 Political science , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," 0563 Peace Studies , 0615 Political science , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," 0563 Peace Studies , 0615 Political science , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies",," 0563 Peace Studies , 0615 Political science , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," Peace Studies , Political science , Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," Social sciences , Civil wars , Clan identity , Islamism , Peacebuilding , Somalia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Possibilities+for+Peacebuilding%3A+Challenges+and+Responses+to+the+Somali+Conflict&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Elmi%2C+Afyare+Abdi&amp;isbn=9780494712191&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Global climate change and the industrial animal agriculture link: A critical discourse analysis,"This thesis examines the discourses of a variety of stakeholders regarding global climate change (GCC), assessing if and how they construct industrial animal agriculture as posing a risk, and if and how these discourses may have shifted since the release of the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Livestock's Long Shadow report. Using Ulrich Beck's concepts of risk society, risk conflicts and relations of definition, this thesis examines how various animal rights and welfare groups, environmental organizations, meat industry stakeholders, governmental agencies and newspapers in Canada, the U.S. and internationally, investigate and construct industrial animal agriculture as a risk, if at all, and how these definitions conflict. In general, social movement organizations were found to problematize industrial animal agriculture before and after the release of the FAO report, whereas industry stakeholders and governmental agencies paid little, if any, attention. Newspapers, however, cited a wide range of topics relating to animal agriculture and GCC, but the most common were based on ethanol and other bio-fuels and alternative sources of energy. This research finds that while the problematization of animal agriculture's contribution to global climate change has been acknowledged by a number of organizations, for the most part, it has not increased since the release of Livestock's Long Shadow.",869733797,,Dissertations & Theses," Bristow, ElizabethBristowElizabethBristow, Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2364248821 , 61869181 , 66569 , 9780494736463 , MR73646 , MR73646", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9780494736463, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/869733797?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0404 Climate Change , 0768 Environmental science"," 0344 Social research , 0404 Climate Change , 0768 Environmental science"," 0344 Social research , 0404 Climate Change , 0768 Environmental science",," 0344 Social research , 0404 Climate Change , 0768 Environmental science"," Social research , Climate Change , Environmental science"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Earth sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+climate+change+and+the+industrial+animal+agriculture+link%3A+A+critical+discourse+analysis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bristow%2C+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9780494736463&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Defining legal frontiers: Immigrant rights adjudication in France and the United States,"This dissertation examines judicially-based efforts to expand rights for immigrant aliens. It argues that nationally-distinct institutions and understandings have played a defining role in shaping this area of legal practice. As a consequence, the analysis suggests that the “global judicialization of immigration” can only be understood in terms of national specificities. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork undertaken in France and the United States, the dissertation traces the chains of relationships and activities that have produced the domain of immigrant rights law reform in each country since the 1970s. Attention is focused on the way in which the litigation tactics and legal strategies associated with immigrant rights law reform are differently constructed in each country. The analysis also attends to the way in which juridical constructions of immigrant rights in turn constitute the relationship of immigrants to the national community. By casting immigrants as a minority group protected from discrimination, or by redefining them as a class of workers endowed with economic rights, juridical framings of immigrants have pushed each country’s politics of immigration in a different direction. The project situates itself across the terrain of multiple disciplines. It contributes to the scholarship on immigration and citizenship by demonstrating the relevance of national political ideologies in constructing diverse and nationally-distinct understandings of immigrant rights. More generally, the project contributes to the scholarship on rights and social movements by exploring the relevance of national fields of power relations in producing nationally-distinct professional hierarchies among projects of political intervention. Finally, the study contributes to discussions of comparative method in sociolegal scholarship and calls into question the utility of restrictive definitions of legality and of law reform. In this domain of legal practice, the status of immigrant legal subjects and the frontiers of citizenship are themselves fluid and contested. Moreover, like migration itself, judicial involvement with immigrant rights is a phenomenon that cuts across diverse national contexts. The social construction of immigrant rights thus requires examination across multiple dimensions. In this way, a domain of law whose content involves permeability of national boundaries serves to highlight the usefulness of crossing disciplinary boundaries in sociolegal research.",89138656,,Dissertations & Theses," Kawar, LeilaKawarLeilaKawar, Leila",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1757065341 , 44497661 , 66569 , 9781109902648 , 3342399 , 3342399", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009, 9781109902648, English, English,,2009,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/89138656?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology",," 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," Law , Political science , Sociology"," Social sciences , Cause lawyering , Comparative , France , Immigration , Law and society , Law reform",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Defining+legal+frontiers%3A+Immigrant+rights+adjudication+in+France+and+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kawar%2C+Leila&amp;isbn=9781109902648&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A cross -cultural analysis of New Urbanist neighborhoods in the US and Turkey: Neighborhood form, community life, and resident experiences","This study examines the cross-cultural practice of New Urbanism, one of the most internationally influential contemporary urban design models. The goal is to expand knowledge of global practice of urban design via a cross-cultural comparison of two New Urbanist neighborhoods—lspartakule in Istanbul, Turkey and Cherry Hill Village in Detroit, USA. The research design employs case study methodology combined with quantitative and qualitative tools. The primary data collection tactics are surveys, face-to-face interviews, and structured observations. The research uncovers the similarities and differences of the two New Urbanist developments in different cultural contexts, with reference to their physical and spatial qualities as well as the residents' motivations, behaviors and attitudes. The primary findings are: (1) The physical and configurational properties of the neighborhoods are significantly different. In the US case, neighborhood form is successfully designed to enhance pedestrian movement and active use of public spaces. In contrast, the design of the Turkish neighborhood has disadvantages that challenge pedestrian movement and use of civic spaces. (2) Public space use and level of social engagement also differ with respect to cultural context. In the US case, streets and civic spaces accommodate a greater variety of activities and are better used than in the Turkish case. Similarly, the US residents are both physically and socially more active than the Turkish residents. (3) Residents' motivations in choosing New Urbanist communities reveal the different priorities of goal-oriented needs in different cultural contexts. US residents consciously chose their New Urbanist neighborhood for its distinct architectural style, traditional town concept and active community life. Turkish residents chose their neighborhood for its high-quality construction and environment. When New Urbanist practice is adapted to a different cultural context, the outcome can contradict New Urbanist principles: neighborhood form might inhibit active use of public spaces; multiple building types might result in segregation; civic spaces might become deserted; neighborhoods might function as isolated settlements rather than well-integrated centers that promote active urban life. New Urbanist practitioners should strive (1) to integrate all of the New Urbanist principles in projects rather than following them partially; (2) to think through the configurational properties of neighborhood projects not only within the project boundaries but also in relation to the larger urban context; (3) to ensure the same quality of design in every context via better control of the planning, design and development phases; and (4) to learn more about the cultural context via pre-design inquiries and possibly collaborations with local design firms that have a better understanding of the local culture and building practices.

The IPSM is part of an international movement called New Public Management (NPM).Â  Chapter 2 analyses NPM. It concludes that while it may deliver effectiveness and efficiency, there have been some unanticipated side effects. Ethical and trust issues have suffered. Chapter 3 examines NPM in Ireland. It concludes that effectiveness, efficiency and transparency have been improved. However, IPSM has presumed the givens about what to be efficient and effective about. Chapters 4 and 5 introduce the common good and the principle of subsidiarity as the basis of an alternative paradigm.Â  Different conceptions of the two that can be found in different disciplines, in theology, philosophy, political theory and governance theory are explored. Chapter 6 examines the common good and the principle of subsidiarity in official Catholic social teaching.Â  It concludes after Vatican II Catholic social teaching is no longer underpinned by a fixed concept of â��human natureâ��, but by a focus on the human person in relation with other human persons.Â  Chapter 7 traces the emergence of what has been called revisionism in Catholic moral theology from the mid-twentieth century onwards. The chapter describes the demise of a universally accepted apodictic moral theology, replaced by approaches that see natural law as: real, experiential, consequential, historical, proportional and personal. The ethicist Jean Porter is explored in Chapter 8.Â  She demonstrates that it is possible within a natural law system to take account of the contingent, to take account of the culturally-specific. In Chapter 9 the approach of the American Jesuit theologian David Hollenbach is examined.Â  The final chapter identifies three major unanticipated results of IPSM: a movement to a market type state; the downplaying of the deliberative role of the civil service; and the enshrining of an anthropology which devalues the person.",898806039,,Dissertations & Theses," McNamara, A.

Throughout Houtartâ��s career he has struggled for social justice, especially in subaltern societies, expressed through his forceful resistance to capitalist globalisation, encouragement for the convergence of social movements, and emphasis upon the importance of collective consciousness and praxis within the changing global context. This research is an exploration of: (a) Houtartâ��s intellectual evolution by reconstructing the major turning points and shifts in his thinking; (b) three core areas of Houtartâ��s thought: religion and society; church and society; and global justice. Houtart is neither as widely recognised nor appreciated as he deserves, especially in the Western, English speaking world.Â  This dissertation is a modest contribution towards addressing this lacuna, arguing for the significance of Houtartâ��s discourse on religion, society, globalisation and theological education. The methodology employed the following sources: (a) written research by and about Houtart; (b) intensive interviews with Houtart; (c) local research at the Centre Tricontinental (CETRI), Louvain-la-Neuve, which was founded by Houtart, and the Centre for Social Analysis (CSA) at the Tamilnadu Theological Seminary in South India; and (d) a mini conference with Houtart in Dublin. The study concludes with some reflections upon theological education, with special reference to Sri Lanka.Â  These reflections should be read as hypotheses for further reflection, elaboration and research.

Marginalised through the emergence of new forms of housing and public spaces, re-appropriated by different fields, and re-invented by the contemporary urban design discourse, the social meaning attached to the roji is being re-interpreted by individuals, subcultures and new social movements to fit hybrid and multiple concepts of living and life styles. The roji presents a unique opportunity to study the pressures of globalisation on smallscale ordinary places at the micro level. Focusing on the case of contemporary Tokyo and drawing on ethnographic data supported by a conceptual framework derived from theories of place and place-attachment, the thesis investigates the kind of functions the roji fulfilled in the city in the past, and the qualities of urban life that have been lost or changed as the alleyway has ceased to be an everyday part of the urban landscape. The thesis further analyses the physical social, personal and cultural dimensions of change, critically interrogating not only spatial marginalisation but also the process of personal re-interpretation and cultural re-appropriation that has befallen the roji. The thesis argues that an analysis of this marginalised urban form can lead to a deeper understanding of the dynamics of urban change and a more sensitive approach to the design of ordinary places. If urban planners and architects are to develop alternative approaches to the creation of diverse and versatile public places in contemporary cities to facilitate richer levels of social interaction, then they must confront the real and conceptual links between everyday practices of place making - the social construction, appreciation and attachment to place - and the ways in which places are affected and shaped by global forces.",899743865,,Dissertations & Theses," Imai, HeideImaiHeideImai, Heide",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491221471 , 65051931 , 101309 , U502747 , U502747", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899743865?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0366 Geography, Geography," 504538 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tokyo%27s+contested+alleyways%3A+the+role+of+the+roji+in+understanding+globalization%2C+attachment+and+the+social+construction+of+place&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Imai%2C+Heide&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The right to housing: theoretical and practical possibilities,"This dissertation examines the existence, content, meaning and potential of the right to housing within international human rights.Â  The thesis has two main objectives.Â  First, it seeks to provide a comprehensive analysis of the human right to housing, a right which, despite recent attention, remains unexamined in crucial ways.Â  Second, through an analysis of the right from conceptual, theoretical, legal and social perspectives, it aims to provide a new space in which under-theorised rights more generally can be re-evaluated. The analysis reveals the complexity and tensions between and among the theory, law and social context of human rights.Â  It also exposes gaps between the right in law, in social practice and in philosophical possibility. Chapter 2 examines the concepts that make up housing, seeking to ascertain the basic human needs and goods that housing protects and provides. The analysis illustrates the centrality of the home as a locus for the protection and enjoyment of human rights and details the deprivations suffered by those made homeless, subject to forced displacement and living in profoundly inadequate housing.Â  This chapter reveals the importance of housing to the individual, but also to the state, locating housing at a key intersection between individual autonomy and meaningful participation in the life of society and the state. This is followed in Chapter 3 by a theoretical examination of major human rights theories.Â  The chapter considers liberal theories of rights, Marxist analyses of rights, critical legal studies, feminist legal theories, post-colonial or Third World (TWAIL) perspectives and communitarian theories of human rights. Chapter 4 turns to an in-depth examination of the content, meaning and definition of the right to housing as enshrined and interpreted in human rights law. This analysis encompasses an assessment of the right as enshrined in international covenants, regional treaties and key national constitutions. Chapter 5 then takes into account the right to housing in social context, focussing on Mumbai, India. Rather than presenting an empirical study, this chapter represents a point of entry into a reflection of the role of the right to housing in struggles for social change. It illustrates the human face of housing rights violation, and examines the creative, radical potential of the right to housing when invoked by social movements, civil society, the judiciary and the state. Chapter 6 reflects on the relationship between the theory, law and practice in the human right to housing.Â  It examines these tensions from the legal perspective by analysing the weaknesses and gaps in the legal interpretation of the right to housing revealed by the foundational analysis undertaken in the thesis.Â  Three major weaknesses are exposed.Â  These are: lack of normative definition of the right, its undue proceduralisation, and the failure of courts and monitoring bodies to adequately embed the right in the social context of its violation.",899743893,,Dissertations & Theses," Hohmann, Jessie MirandaHohmannMirandaJessieHohmann, Jessie Miranda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491223791 , 64930551 , 101309 , U504046 , U504046", Dissertation/Thesis, 2009,, English, English,,2009,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2009,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899743893?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAIU504046 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+right+to+housing%3A+theoretical+and+practical+possibilities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2009-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hohmann%2C+Jessie+Miranda&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Understanding the background of the political and social movements supporting the united nations,"Although academic literature predominantly discusses UN centrism as Japan’s foreign policy, this thesis stipulates it as a popular norm supported by the Japanese public. The thesis employs the constructivist approach in understanding UN centrism as a domestic norm. Following the analytical methods employed in existing studies on norm diffusion, it identifies UN centrism is Japan’s interpretation of the international UN norms seen through the lens of its post-war domestic pacifist norm. Building on existing literature on civil society and Japanese studies, it analyses how civil movements supporting UNESCO and UNICEF have worked their way through Japanese society, traditional social behaviours and customs to diffuse the norm. The success of the civil movements has not been in spite of Japan’s weak civil society but because its characteristics have worked in their favour. The UN centrism norm at its core urges individuals to construct peace and international cooperation through the UN. The norm continues to develop, and today it has become a norm which not only urges ordinary Japanese to think about creating and maintaining peace through the UN, but also to make personal financial contributions to support UN humanitarian activities and even dictates where they should visit for their next holiday.",1040520948,,Dissertations & Theses," Yasui, HiroshiYasuiHiroshiYasui, Hiroshi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2762547161 , 71866362 , 101309 , U572338 , U572338 , http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/1060/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1040520948?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0616 International law, International law," http://etheses.bham.ac.uk/1060/ , (UMI)AAIU572338 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Understanding+the+background+of+the+political+and+social+movements+supporting+the+united+nations&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yasui%2C+Hiroshi&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""National Socialism Before Nazism: Friedrich Naumann and Theodor Fritsch, 1890–1914","This dissertation is a rethinking and critique of the concept of ""national socialism."" I show that this concept not only emerged in Germany years before Nazism, but also arose within the mainstream of German society, alongside and independently of parallel developments in the radical right. Alarmed by the dramatic rise of an internationalist, Marxist socialism in the years following German unification, a succession of prominent public figures gave voice to an alternative, nationalist reading of the social problems accompanying capitalist industrialization. This endeavor involved a wholesale reconceptualization of social life and social reform, and a marginalization of the concern for social justice and emancipation in favor of a preoccupation with national order, homogeneity, and power. The dissertation focuses on two variants of national socialism developed in Germany prior to the First World War, one by the left-leaning bourgeois reformist Friedrich Naumann and the other by the right-wing völkisch antisemite Theodor Fritsch. Their differences notwithstanding, both strands of national socialism shared two major ideational foundations. First, both were underpinned by a national existentialism: the claim that the nation is facing a ""struggle for existence"" which necessitates aggressive international expansion, colonization, and ethnic purification. The social reforms demanded by national socialism were, accordingly, geared at systematically harnessing all socio-economic forces in the service of these purportedly ""existential"" struggles. Second, both variants of national socialism adhered to a national productivism that, by stressing the need for cooperation among all the ""productive"" strata of the nation, elided the class-based exploitation characteristic of industrial capitalism. On the basis of their national productivism, both Naumann and Fritsch were opposed simultaneously to Marxism with its class-conflict view of society on the one hand, and to liberalism with its individualistic worldview on the other hand. Given that Naumann and Fritsch were pivotal figures in their respective social, cultural, and political milieux—Naumann in the reformist bourgeoisie, Fritsch in the radical right—their articulation of a national-existential claim on the social is indicative of a profound generational shift in the ideational climate of Imperial Germany. This generational shift did not consist in the appearance of national socialism itself, which had already been articulated in the 1870s by prominent figures such as political economist Gustav Schmoller and Christian socialist Adolf Stoecker. Rather, the shift consisted in the shedding of the ethical-conservative sensibility of the first generation of national socialism in favor of a sense of existential urgency grounded in a biologistic imagination. The impact of national socialism on the generation of Naumann and Fritsch reached its apex in the First World War, when an existential national socialism constituted the ideological underpinning of Germany's war economy, i.e. the systematic regimentation and mobilization of the national economy in service of the war effort. Beyond the fresh perspective it offers on the historical dynamics of Imperial Germany, the dissertation also sheds new light on the intellectual-historical context in which national socialism made its way into the name and program of the Nazi movement from 1920 onward. The study suggests that the conceptual field of national socialism into which Nazism entered after the First World War was more variegated, more sophisticated, and had deeper historical and intellectual roots than previously believed.",1086336752,,Dissertations & Theses," Kedar, AsafKedarAsafKedar, Asaf",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2779836881 , 54174331 , 66569 , 9781267612281 , 3527108 , 3527108", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781267612281, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1086336752?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," 0335 European history , 0615 Political science",," 0335 European history , 0615 Political science"," European history , Political science"," Social sciences , Fritsch, Theodor , Germany , National socialism , Naumann, Friedrich",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=National+Socialism+Before+Nazism%3A+Friedrich+Naumann+and+Theodor%0AFritsch%2C+1890%E2%80%931914&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kedar%2C+Asaf&amp;isbn=9781267612281&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Challenging the ""crime of silence"": subsistence harms and their recognition within and beyond conventional law","Human existence determines that we are vulnerable not only to attacks on physical integrity, but also to harms which militate against the means of subsistence.  Deprivations of subsistence needs in the form of attacks on homes, land, livelihoods and basic resources have been widely perpetrated throughout history and are a particularly significant feature of contemporary conflict and political repression.  However, international law is yet to fully recognise these harms as a discrete form of injustice and thus to address them within the mechanisms of international criminal and transitional justice.  The thesis defines deprivations of subsistence needs, when perpetrated with knowledge of the possible consequences of such attacks, as “subsistence harms”.  It argues that subsistence harms constitute a particular and devastating type of violence, which involves interrelated physical, mental and social harms and is inherently gendered.  While the existing legal framework acknowledges some aspects of subsistence harms, the failure of law to understand them as discrete, yet also multifaceted, means that its approach remains partial and fragmented; often resulting in continued marginalisation or silencing of these harms. The thesis examines both the potential and the pitfalls of using international law to begin to fully recognise subsistence harms.  It argues that international law could and should play an importance role in promoting their recognition.  Nevertheless, the thesis also problematises the role of law and draws on critical approaches, in order to analyse alternative understandings of harm and spaces for recognition; especially the praxis of non-governmental tribunals and of social movements.  Although law can provide a language for recognition of harms, which can be drawn on by such movements, it also imposes barriers to recognition due to its narrow conceptions of harm and violence.  The relationship between subsistence harms and legal recognition is therefore complex and thus requires much greater attention within legal discourse, if such harms are ever to be fully addressed.",1221965679,,Dissertations & Theses," Sankey, DianaSankeyDianaSankey, Diana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2832368391 , 73444752 , 101309 , U576764 , U576764", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1221965679?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0398 Law, Law," 544029 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Challenging+the+%22crime+of+silence%22%3A+subsistence+harms+and+their+recognition+within+and+beyond+conventional+law&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sankey%2C+Diana&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Enhancing the capabilities of small producers in developing countries to meet global challenges: an investigation into the contribution of international craft development initiatives,"Worldwide, externally supported craft development initiatives aim to enhance the capability of local craft producers to succeed in globalized markets. However, the contribution that these organizations make towards the abilities of local actors remains unclear. Following a hermeneutic reflection on literature, empirical field experience derived from the African and South Pacific contexts and a multiple case study analysis of craft development organizations, the research investigates the pre-conceptions that lie behind approaches adopted in craft development initiatives. Two emerging elements of particular importance have been identified. Firstly, the Western ideological notion of craft, influenced particularly by the Arts and Crafts movement, and secondly the ethos of social design, built on the legacy of the appropriate technology movement. It is argued that both of these have a constraining impact on the development of indigenous design skills that underpin successful participation in global markets. Noting that craft covers a wide range of practices, the research at hand furthermore identifies a category of craft that has become the epitome of Non-Western craft. These decorative and exotic artifacts are labor-intensive to produce, making them only marginally profitable for the makers. Yet there is an apparent emphasis on the promotion of this category within international craft development initiatives. The research concludes that the current practice of craft development initiatives cannot fully contribute to the development of the response capability of the local craft producers. Enhancing the impact of these initiatives would require serious reconsideration of product strategies and a re-think of the premises under which initiatives are undertaken.

Consequently, migrant women from developing countries provide an inexpensive and accessible child care alternative, which could be regarded as widespread in certain regions. Growth in the movement of population and mounting global interdependence, has also contributed to an increase in educational institutions labelled international schools. As an educator in five of these diverse institutions, I became aware that the trend of hiring maids, who because of their social position often do many basic tasks for children in their care, has entered the world of international schools in particular geographical areas. This has often concerned professionals. This small-scale study, therefore, explores the perceived social and educational implications of home/school differences in pedagogic orientation in children who have maids, bringing to light a matter of consequence, to certain international schools in particular, in more academic terms. Two very different schools in the Arabian Gulf, both regarded as operating in an international context, were the focus for this study. Drawing on Vygotskian and post-Vygotskian theories, I used sociocultural theory and Engeström’s model of activity theory as a theoretical framework from which to design the inquiry, and carry out the analysis. Using the two sample schools to access key-stakeholders, this inquiry involved multi-methods of mainly qualitative data collection, which explored a situation where maids are often heavily involved in children’s upbringing. A range of nationalities were included. Important messages emerged, including the notion of maids appearing to be culturally embedded amongst a number of affluent host country nationals and expatriates in my context. Additionally, significant differences appear to exist between children with maids at home and those without, with implications for learning amongst ‘maid children’, which might be perceived as a result of maid intervention. The thesis concludes with recommendations for educationalists and parents. Views of most key stakeholders underpin a model which could guide new practice and go some way towards alleviating the consequences of such a situation.",1314566301,,Dissertations & Theses," Bradley, GailBradleyGailBradley, Gail",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC;

This project illustrates how successfully revitalized unions were able to foster ""cultures of creativity,"" which inspired new organizing strategies and new understandings about what a union should be. Two factors were particularly important to the generation of these cultures. First, cohorts of social movement outsiders brought new ideas to these unions. Second, revitalized unions had organizational structures that were decentralized enough for experimentation, but centralized enough for coordination, meaning that outsiders had the space to experiment and unions had the infrastructure to learn from, and scale up, those experiments that were successful.",1322974380,,Dissertations & Theses," Sharpe, Teresa ChristineSharpeChristineTeresaSharpe, Teresa Christine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2933583331 , 76830812 , 66569 , 9781267975416 , 3555923 , 3555923", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781267975416, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1322974380?accountid=14496," 0629 Labor relations , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0629 Labor relations , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0629 Labor relations , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0629 Labor relations , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Labor relations , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Labor movements , Labor unions , Organizational leadership , Service industry",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultures+of+Creativity%3A+Politics%2C+Leadership+and+Organizational+Change+in+the+U.S.+Labor+Movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sharpe%2C+Teresa+Christine&amp;isbn=9781267975416&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Building sustainable societies: Exploring sustainability policy and practice in the age of high consumption,"This dissertation is an attempt to examine how humans in wealthy, post-industrial urban contexts understand sustainability and respond to their concerns given their sphere of influence. I focus specifically on sustainable consumption policy and practice in Sweden, where concerns for sustainability and consumer-based responses are strong. This case raises interesting questions about the relative strength of sustainability movements in different cultural and geo-political contexts as well as the specific factors that have motivated the movement toward sustainable living in Sweden. The data presented here supports the need for multigenic theories of sustainable consumerism. Rather than relying on dominant theories of reflexive modernization, there is a need for locally and historically grounded analyses. The Swedish case illustrates that the relative strength of sustainable living is linked not only to high levels of awareness about social, economic and ecological threats to sustainability, but also to a strong and historically rooted emphasis on equality in Sweden. In this context, sustainable living is often driven by concerns for global equity and justice. The research therefore affirms the findings of those like Hobson (2002) and Berglund and Matti (2005) who argue that concerns for social justice often have more resonance with citizen-consumers - driving more progressive lifestyle changes than personal self-interest. Yet despite the power of moral appeals, this research also suggests that the devolution of responsibility for sustainability - to citizens in their roles as consumers on the free market – has failed to produce significant change. While many attribute this failure to “Gidden’s Paradox” or the assumption that people will not change their lifestyles until they see and feel risks personally, the data presented here illustrates that even those most committed to sustainable living confront structural barriers that they do not have the power to overcome. The paradox is not that people can’t understand or act upon threats to sustainability from afar; but rather that it is extremely difficult to live more sustainably without strong social support, market regulation and political leadership. Sustainability policy must work to confront the illusion of choice by breaking down structural barriers, particularly for people who do not have the luxury of choosing alternatives.

The goal is to define the dynamics of this communicative ecology as a means of interpreting semantic space, sometimes defined as aesthetics, for understanding how people interpret - meaning. The findings are to provide a framework for designing software architecture that can contextualize information, and define a broader context for discussing the hybridization of technology and culture in today’s digital world.

It is methodologically grounded in “collaborative activist geographical methods” and theoretically based at the nexus of development, political ecologies, neoliberalization of Nature, and geographies of hope literatures. It examines the contradictory and complex ways that state “climate change mitigation development” projects surround and infiltrate the Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian ancestral territories of the canton of San Lorenzo (Esmeraldas Province), located in the “Northwest Pacific Fronter Territory-region of Ecuador”. This research asks to what degree the Ecuadorian state’s support and investment in oil palm plantation expansion—designed to meet biofuel crop demands—in the coastal rainforest regions results in the rearrangement, and often times, devastation of Indigenous Awá and Chachi and Afro-ecuadorian communities’ natural and human geographies. It also inquires into the Ecuadorian government’s recently approved (October 2008) state-level conservation incentives project called Socio-Bosque (Forest Partners) developed to do the following: protect the rainforests and its ecological services, alleviate poverty in rural areas, and position the country as an ‘environmental world leader’ for taking concrete actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from avoided deforestation. Socio Bosque claims to be progressive and even revolutionary, but may enact new forms of exploitation and governance in Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian territories that are specific to time and place, but are enduringly colonial. Nevertheless, this research also highlights geographies of hope by demonstrating that, contrary to the surrounding sea of monoculture oil palm plantations and the CO 2 lonial air of contradictory laws in relation to biofuel and ecological services development, Awá, Chachi, and Afro-ecuadorian communities maintain sustainable practices and enhance agricultural diversity within their territories. Additionally, it emphasizes the emergent place-based social movements in relation to defense of their territories and identities; Indigenous and Afro-ecuadorian communities avoid conflict pressures by creating inter-ethnic networks. By casting social nets between their territories, their communities stay connected and, together, defend their rights to territorial self-determination and “Living Well” and the rights of Nature.

Increasingly grievances are aired in the streets around the world, and are broadcast in the popular media. However, with the prominence of techno-scientific and ecomanagerial approaches to the ‘ecological crisis’ ecological discourse may be in the process of becoming the new rubric of global governance. Here I engage debates concerning biopolitics and the production of subjectivity, in order to assess the implications of the theatricality of interventions for recasting the terms according to which ecological problematics are approached. I pursue this question: How can theatrics intervene in shaping the political ecology of the future? I begin this thesis by presenting a theory of the politics of theatricality as it applies to the development and reshaping of global ecological politics. In the subsequent chapters, I develop this theory in light of the uses of theatricality in the World Urban Festival, an ‘arts-for-social-change’ festival on the theme of ‘sustainability’ held in Vancouver; an environmental health education program launched in Ecuador with international support; and within local and international activist movements in the aftermath of the Bhopal Gas Leak, widely considered to be the worst industrial disaster of the twentieth century. I argue that while the theatricality of such interventions can promote a particular ecological ethic that minimizes the politics at stake, theatrical interventions can also challenge the de-politicized naturalization of ecological problems. I conclude that the context and nature of relationships staged in and through each event shapes the politics of theatricality, and in turn, the production of global ecological subjectivities. As such, I identify the various challenges and opportunities signalled by this trend toward staging ecologies.",1685021383,,Dissertations & Theses," Spiegel, JenniferSpiegelJenniferSpiegel, Jennifer",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3702143961 , 65064881 , 101309 , U636134 , U636134 , http://research.gold.ac.uk/3469/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1685021383?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://research.gold.ac.uk/3469/ , (UMI)AAIU636134 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Staging+ecologies%3A+the+politics+of+theatricality+and+the+production+of+global+ecological+subjectivities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Spiegel%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Home and away: british women's narratives of community in spain,"Aim: To examine constructions of community among retired migrants from the UK in the Costa Blanca in Spain. Background: ‘Community’ as a concept has enduring theoretical and practical significance. Often discussed in terms of representing something lost yet recoverable, community has further relevance in understanding social change and continuity. Underpinning discourses of community, there is often a recurrent theme of loss and recovery which has utopian and nostalgic overtones and this permeates contemporary understandings of what community represents. This is also reflected by the Labour Government’s appropriation of community as a panacea for social problems. Since the 1970s, migration to Spanish coastal resorts – costas - has significantly increased and retired British migrants constitute a large proportion of such movement. The development of theories to facilitate understanding of these new ‘transnational’ communities through lifestyle migration is a relatively new area of study and I aim to contribute to this. The idea that the absence of community is problematic combined with a romantic discourse relating to ‘past ages’- or ‘nostalgia’ - warrants further exploration. Methods: Seventeen in-depth interviews were undertaken with a theoretically sampled group of women who had moved to the Costa Blanca from the UK. The interviews were transcribed and analysed using a narrative approach. Findings: There are multiple forms of belonging to community. Representations of community are multi-dimensional, complex and overlapping in nature. Place continues to be salient, but belonging to places is now more complex as a result of transnationalism through lifestyle migration and increased global movement. Constructions of belonging to place are inextricably linked to networks and ethnicity. Conclusion: Nostalgic constructions of community can be understood as an antidote to modernity and nostalgia denotes the mourning of a lost time as well as a lost home or place. In times of rapid social change, when people’s intimacy with the world – represented as belonging to places, networks and ethnic group - is compromised, they seek to recreate it through nostalgia. Nostalgic constructions of belonging are key to how people give meaning to their lives. Different types of belonging are linked to community through a sense of nostalgic intimacy with the world. If intimacy with the world is compromised then nostalgia constructs and reflects belonging. In the absence of real intimacy or closeness, nostalgia is ignited through narrative and fills this gap.

The term free software is used for computer programs that can be employed, examined, distributed and modified without restriction.  What started with a small group of software developers in the 1980s has grown into a full-blown techno-political movement that has changed the way software is produced.  In the last ten years or so, free software has come to the attention of a global public because it so successfully provides access to resources that the conventional software industry has failed to deliver. It is often reasoned that this is due to its technical superiority.  My data suggests, however, that technical capacity is achieved through a social practice that is based upon collaboration.  Indeed collaboration constitutes a new form of material production that aims to make intangible resources (i.e. software) available to a large number of people worldwide.  In this dissertation I argue that the way in which contributors to free software collaborate and provide material objects differs from what we know of the conventional production of techno-scientific artefacts.  The innovative method of producing free software relies philosophically upon quite conventional political ideology which can best be described as liberal individualism.  This ideology informs participants’ discourse and practice as well as helps to integrate and stabilise the community. My ethnographic data shows that despite the worldwide distribution of the movement’s members, the majority of them originate from the well-educated middle class, an elite that strongly relies on these philosophical values. To defend their collaborative methods of production, free software participants engage in political action against certain forms of neo-liberal legislation concerning ‘intellectual property’.  Their productive practices are based upon an alternative model of ownership of intangible goods which constitutes both a liberal critique of and an alternative to the concept of ‘intellectual property’.",1779949545,,Dissertations & Theses," Krieger, Bernhard LudwigKriegerLudwigBernhardKrieger, Bernhard Ludwig",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017505331 , 64941291 , 101309 , U566873 , U566873", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779949545?accountid=14496, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0624 Occupational psychology, Occupational psychology," (UMI)AAIU566873 , Psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+production+of+free+software%3A+an+ethnographic+enquiry+into+a+new+social+practise&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Krieger%2C+Bernhard+Ludwig&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"On modeling and dynamics analysis of social crowd behavior,"Translation from original language as provided by author Since crowd behavior was observed by Gustav LeBon in 1896, the mass behaviors and motion of crowds have beenmodeled and simulated with different application ﬁelds recently, such as computer game, public safety management, architecture, computer graphics, robotics, training system, and sociology so on. However, we apply crowd model and simulation technology to describing social crowd and their behaviors for the management and training of emergency response in military for specially. As we know, the society including large-scale components and large-scale relationship is usually researched as the complex systems. Moreover complex networks theory, evolutionary game theory and Agent-based modeling theory has been adopted as the tools on complex system practically.The research on dynamics of collective behavior is combined with evolutionary game theory on network, generalized synchronization on network and Agent-based modeling method. The microscopic interactions between goal-oriented individuals can result in the macroscopic-behavioral dynamics of crowd behaviors. By the tools above, spatial and temporal dynamics reveal fascinating global emergence phenomena and interesting patterns of group movement and autonomous behavioral development. The main content and contribution of this dissertation are summarized as follows: 1. A novel deﬁnition of generalized synchronization on complex networks is introduced to understand the dynamics of crowd behavior. With two usualmethods detecting generalized synchronization, two criteria of generalized synchronization on networks are advanced. 2. The social behavior selection network (BSN), as an improved social behaviors, is modeled to understand the origin of dominant behaviors in social networks that generally lead to emergence of crowd. For behavioral selection networks with complex networks topology, we demonstrate the existence of phase transition curves relating from diversity of behaviors to crowd behaviors. By virtue of changing the topological structure, the behavioral networks behave afﬂuent dynamical phenomena, including the emergency of crowd behaviors. 3. The nonlinear dynamics of the behaviors selection networks model, by virtue of which we can understand the origin of ﬂocking behaviors in social networks, is researched. For behavioral networks with different complex networks topology, the nonlinear dynamics including the chaotic dynamics by the numerical simulation tools are illuminated. With changing the structure of networks topology and the mutation matrix, the behavioral networks behave afﬂuent dynamical phenomena. 4. The Large-Scale Crowd Behavior Simulation prototype system platform for emergency response adopting an agent-based modeling approach is developed. The Agent model perceives the human being as a psychosomatic, autonomous acting creature with emotion evolutionary capabilities that is embedded in a virtual dynamic social environment. The layered architecture of the prototype system involving in human behavior in crisis situations is explained in detail. The model holds different internal states of human beings to support the decision making, which is composed of physical, emotional, and social aspects. The emotion contagion model decides the modeling solutions for common environmental, sociopsychological and behavioral phenomena in the context of crisis, deﬁnes their interrelation and impact on an individual's internal state and integrates them into a comprehensive modeling approach. The LSCS prototype system platform can be used to analyze, forecast and control the complex situations under emergent crisis. 5. The relationship between Agent-based modeling (ABM) tools and Equation-based modeling (EBM) methods are clariﬁed through modeling and simulating the crowd behavior. ABM emphasis the detail components of complex system using the bottom-up approach. Adversely, EBM can mainly model the total dynamics of the complex system using the top-down method. Fortunately we can integrate the two tools above to model the system by virtue of the complementarity of ABM and",1868104529,,Dissertations & Theses," Xu, Xu LinXuLinXuXu, Xu Lin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313766481 , 111084642 , 189128 , 10372453 , 10372453", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868104529?accountid=14496, 0546 Industrial engineering, 0546 Industrial engineering, 0546 Industrial engineering,, 0546 Industrial engineering, Industrial engineering," (UMI)AAI10372453 , Applied sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+modeling+and+dynamics+analysis+of+social+crowd+behavior&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Xu%2C+Xu+Lin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A tentative study on lin yutang's prose-poetry translation from the perspective of aesthetic modernity,"Translation from original language as provided by author In China, modernity is still an unfinished project, for it has not enough time and opportunity to grow adequately as a result of the twists and turns of social development and some man-made obstacles. Therefore, the pursuit of modernity becomes the mainstream of modern Chinese culture during the 20th Century. With the context of ""cultural turn"", cultural studies have also been grafted onto translation studies. Modernity, as a new hot translation research point, integrates translation with culture under the context. The development of modernity is full of contradictions and tension. From the birth of modernity, it appears as a paradox of enlightenment and aesthetics. The contradiction and tension of them constitute a motive force and promote the development of the modernity. However, with the development of modernity, various weaknesses of enlightenment modernity have emerged which have been recognized by some Chinese intellectuals. The material culture restrained the development of people's spiritual culture, the freedom of expressing personality and individualism has been repressed unprecedentedly, people's ordinary life increasingly tends to be stratified and routinized, what's worse, rational and regulated existence turned out to be the general social phenomenon. Under this circumstance, humans became a labor instrument of production for high profit in the pursuit of modernity, which led to social utilitarianism. Lin Yutang is just one of them who are aware of the great influence of aesthetic modernity of Chinese traditional culture in the process of modernity. His translation practice went through the May Fourth Movement of China, ""anti-culture"" movement of US in the 1950s and 1960s and the impact of modernity. His aesthetic modernity is also one of approaches applied by modern intellectuals to develop self-identification in the modern culture with its special modern value. Lin Yutang ceased to apply his active involvement in the ""westernization"" campaign, and began to translate Chinese classical works into English for westerners with his aesthetic tendency in order to push Chinese culture into global stage, which gained great popularity in the West. Both his translated works and writings are stamped with the characteristics of aesthetic modernity. Different from his contemporaries, he advocates lifelike translation which expresses the freedom of personality and plays definitely a significant role in the modernization process of Chinese culture as well as the promotion of Chinese culture in the West. First of all, this thesis studies Lin's translation theory and classifies them into three requirements for translators and three translation criteria. Secondly, under the theoretical guidance of the four dimensions of aesthetic modernity: aesthetic redemption, refusing mediocrity, tolerance for ambiguity, aesthetic introspection, we expound his translation theory and his text choice from the four dimensions of aesthetic modernity, and sum up four characteristics of aesthetic modernity about his translation theory and his text choice. Lifelike translation, aesthetic creativity, cultural harmony and his selection of Chinese classics as the source-text are epitome of aesthetic modernity of his translation. Finally, Lin's prose-poetry translation work, Anthology of Su Tungpo's Prose and Poetry, is taken as the case to investigate the aesthetic modernity of his translation from the aesthetic subject. It is found that Lin and Su Tungpo share similar temperament in religious belief, lifestyle, cultural and aesthetic value, which formulates the basis of his lifelike translation. Lifelike, the core of Lin's translation theory, is the embodiment of his Hsingling literary option, which is the main feature of aesthetic modernity. Then Lin's translation theory is integrated with his translation practice to investigate the aesthetic modernity of his translation from the aesthetic object. It is found that lifelike translation, sentence-for-sentence translation, hybridity translation method and adaptation are manifestations of aesthetic modernity in Lin Yutang's prose-poetry",1868132585,,Dissertations & Theses," Dai, Wen JingDaiJingWenDai, Wen Jing",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313781101 , 111085412 , 189128 , 10353529 , 10353529", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868132585?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10353529 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+tentative+study+on+lin+yutang%27s+prose-poetry+translation+from+the+perspective+of+aesthetic+modernity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dai%2C+Wen+Jing&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The ideological theories of the second international left-wing scholars,"Translation from original language as provided by author Since 1880s, many Second International Left-wing scholars, such as Lafargue,Paul, Merlin, luxembourg,have tried their best to exert basic position, standpoint and methods of Marxism to elaborate theirs'theories of ideology. With actual struggles, they have widely propagandized and safeguarded Marxism, deeply revealing and criticizing the ideological theories of capitalism. Their ideological theories, as an important part in the evolution history of Marxist ideological theories, are one of the sources of Leninism ideological theories and have made great historical contributions to defend the ideological theories of Marxism. Lafargue's criticism on the ideological theories of capitalism is the most typical one compared with the theorists of the Second International. His ideological theories are based on the historical conception of Marxism. His explanation about the essence and function of the religion and criticism on bourgeois religion and morals refract his adroit and sagaciousness. The philosophical basis of Merlin' ideological theories is historical materialism, formulating basic tasks of Marxist ethics and pointing out its status and function in proletarian struggle. He has made great contributions to criticizing various morals of the bourgeoisie and opportunism as well as pioneering a new field of Marxist literary and art criticism. Luxembourg , as an objector and critic against reconcilement, is the most positive and uncompromising in struggling against the ideology of reformism. She reveals the source, essence, social class foundation and ideological content of Bernsteinism,guarding and developping the Marxism fundamentals. The prominent contribution that Luxembourg has made to the International Communism Movement is the staunch struggle against the reformism ideology. The analysis of the ideological theories by the Second International Left-wing scholars should be divided into two aspects. Their contributions are great which generally incorporate Marxism and retain the essence with the basic Marxism standpoint. Meanwhile, there are weakness and deficiencies in their theories, that is, the incomplete comprehension towards Marxism essence and the oversimplified and superficial tendency in applying the Marxism fundamentals. They explain hierarchically the Marxism fundamentals rather than respond actively in theory to the continuous generated new situations. The ideological theories by the Second International Left-wing scholars play an indispensable role in the ideological construction of socialism countries. The transitional and transforming aspects of the eras that they lived in resemble surprisingly with those of the contemporary China. Through reinspecting the heritages of the ideological theories by the Second International Left-wing scholars, their theories are found for having provided many important thoughts for the conformation and development of the sinicized ideological theories. The ideological construction of socialism in China should learn from the ups and downs of Second International on the basis of comprehensive arrangement, accurate mastery and critical adaptation, unearthing their enlightening significance on the ideological construction in China and reflecting on the positive effects on the ideological construction of socialism countries, for evading a recapitulation of Marxism marginalization in the period of Second",1868133799,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, Xiang JingLiJingXiangLi, Xiang Jing",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313772451 , 111084922 , 189128 , 10386109 , 10386109", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868133799?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAI10386109 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+ideological+theories+of+the+second+international+left-wing+scholars&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Xiang+Jing&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study on japanese nationals in modern tianjin,"Translation from original language as provided by author Emigrant, a national of a particular country living in another country for a long time but not retaining the nationality of the resident country, is not of political color in itself. However, it played an ignominious role and became the vanguard and accomplice for the intruders while western powers intimidated the weak countries in modern times. How they lived when they left their home country was the problem that social history should pay attention to. China and Japan is adjacent to each other, among which people communication has been very frequent. Early in history there were Japanese nationals visiting China for schooling or trade. However, in Modern times, Japan went a way to invade China, and many Japanese emigrants rushed to China. As the frontiers for Japanese invasion, Tianjin was attractive to the Japanese. Therefore, the study on the Japanese emigrants in Tianjin can not only reveal the essence of Japanese invasion to China in Modern times, but also learn its social realities, having a deep reality meaning. This paper attempts to do the research with the guide of dialectical materialism and historical materialism, and by application of history, sociology, textology, statistics, demography, etc. Specifically speaking, this paper includes the preface, four chapters and conclusion. The preface will introduce the object and approach of the thesis, the existing studies at home and abroad, and the meaning and creative points of this thesis; the first chapter will summarize the living space of Japanese emigrants, ie. the demarcation, creation and development of the Concession, and the management institution and how Japanese emigrants practiced the self rule; the second chapter analyzes the population shift, space distribution and occupation structure of Japanese emigrants, as well as their characteristics from the point view of sociology and demography; the third chapter sketches the trade between Tianjin and Japan in Modern times and Japanese trade, banking and industry in Tianjin, which will reveal how the Japanese transferred Tianjin into its invasion frontiers, and sketch the social structure and economic situation of Japanese emigrants; the fourth chapter discusses the social activities of Japanese emigrants, from the society organization, social activities, the response to anti-Japanese movement, education and health care affairs, leisure and amusement, analyzes the psycho course and the Japanese society constructed in Tianjin under the background of shift of Sino-Japanese relation; the concluding chapter makes an objective review on the society of Japanese emigrants, arguing the Japanese emigrants that lived in Tianjin, who were at the frontiers of Japanese invasion, under the background of deterioration of Sino-Japanese relation, and in addition for the insularity and strong group indicativeness of Japanese emigrants, had unconsciously become the accomplice of Japanese invaders. On the one hand, the society of Japanese emigrants was teemed with contradiction. Due to the international color and the feature of concession of Tianjin, while wanting to keep their tradition, and maintain their dignity, they tried to construct a heterotopia of Japanese society and shut themselves in a constrained space; on the other hand, they had to confront the collision from the Chinese and Western cultures, living under a constrained",1868349278,,Dissertations & Theses," Wan, Lu JianWanJianLuWan, Lu Jian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313760411 , 111084472 , 189128 , 10373756 , 10373756", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868349278?accountid=14496, 0506 World History, 0506 World History, 0506 World History,, 0506 World History, World History," (UMI)AAI10373756 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+japanese+nationals+in+modern+tianjin&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wan%2C+Lu+Jian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A study of the social condition of canadian blacks in 1950s-1960s,"Translation from original language as provided by author As a typical immigrant country, Canada has attracted the attention of the world with its unique ethnic composition and colorful culture traditions. As a group of immigrants, Canadian blacks have lived here for about four hundred years since European settlers came to Canada. But in the process of Canada's development, The British and the French has always dominated the social culture and the minorities including blacks had been excluded from the mainstream culture. Although the population of blacks accounted for only a small proportion in Canadian population, they had played an important role in the history of Canada. They had made tremendous contributions to the development of the politics, economy and culture. But they had been considered as a disadvantaged group in the society until World War II. Great changes have taken place in the world after World War II. The concept of racial equality has emerged and demolished the ethnocentrism of the Europeans. The concept of racial equality has swept every corner of the world, which made the blacks struggle against the unjust treatments they had suffered. Meanwhile, many African countries have gained independence and elevated their international status.

In this situation, Marxist theoreticians in the Second International debated on revolution and a way out. The argument between Bernstein and Rosa Luxemburg about taking the way of class struggle or daily struggle called Lukacs' attention to everyday life which offers a new direction of thinking.This thesis takes Lukacs' History and Class Consciousness, Aesthetics Specificity and The Ontology of Social Existence as text basis, combined with the domestic and foreign advanced research results, elaborating Lukacs' critique theory of everyday life throughout his life. In the early years, Lukacs based himself on class and class struggle, analyzed and criticized the phenomenon of objectification in everyday life with totalizing historical dialectics, and proposed the theory of class consciousness as core of ideology critique and proletarian revolution. In his later years, Lukacs had promoted his understanding of everyday life. On the one hand, he took everyday life as ontological existence; and on the other, he criticized daily thinking and appealed to individual liberation. On this basis, the thesis expounds the theoretical difficulties in Lukacs' critique theory of everyday life, and then elaborates the growing point of French Existentialist Marxism and Budapest school out of this",1868689655,,Dissertations & Theses," Xia, Hai QinXiaQinHaiXia, Hai Qin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4314331911 , 70621302 , 189128 , 10368618 , 10368618", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1868689655?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," (UMI)AAI10368618 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+lukacs%27+critique+theory+of+everyday+life&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Xia%2C+Hai+Qin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Conflict of value in the era of globalization,"Translation from original language as provided by author Globalization is growing and developping under the continuous development of social productive forces and people's social interaction,is historical inevitability. A new round of globalization movement marked with information technology has brought revolutionary changes to the people's economic, political and cultural fields, has caused varying degrees of impact and brought opportunities to the world. Value as a in-depth content of culture, as a special spiritual phenomenon of human beings, to guide and regulate people's practical activities, will demonstrate conflicts and contradictions under the influence of globalization simimarly, and this trend is becoming more and more strong.Value has impacted on people's life significantly. Value is a wide-ranging concept,to put it simply,value is the meaning of the object satisfy subject's needs. Value belongs to the realm of ideology,restricted and impacted by the mode of social production,its development process must adapt to the development of production methods, otherwise it will produce active reaction on productivity, promote or delay the process of development of social history, its role is obviously. So, if value produces conflict, it will have a knock-on effect on the world's economic, political, cultural and other aspects. Conflict of values arising from the human consciousness since the day it already exists, globalization has made this conflict more clearly manifested and caused people's attention.

The tennis court appeared as early as 1916, the tennis specialized team was established in 1956 and the tennis association was set up in 1958. With the government's support and coaches' diligence, until now large quantities of outstanding tennis athletes have been trained who have competed for the gold and silver medals and created good results repeatedly in the domestic and international tennis matches. Along with the domestic tennis profession and the holding of the national extra-curricular tennis public match, the province and city leaders have paid more attention to the tennis movement development and carried out the tennis work relentlessly. Tennis sport administrative center in Chengdu was set up in 1997 which has made the tennis movement develop more rapidly and an every year tennis public match in Chengdu started from 1990 has become the magnificent sports meet for tennis amateurs of Chengdu and peripheral cities. A series of tennis associations, clubs and so on have sprung up like mushrooms, which have increased from 12 in 1997 to 48 in 2006(nearly 200 in Sichuan Province according to the statistics). The tennis courts in Chengdu have suddenly increased from 274 in 1997 to more than 650 in 2006(nearly more than 900 in Sichuan according to statistics).  There is approximately 300,000 tennis population in Chengdu, so it is no doubt that the tennis project is a market with much potential. Along with the social capital entering the sports facility construction, attracting foreign investment and the unceasing real estate development, more and more tennis stadiums have been set up; therefore the competition pressure for the tennis stadium also increases. And the factors influence the tennis status management also increase, among the multitudinous factors, adopting the reasonable and effective marketing method has attracted the stadium's great attention, but because of lacking the marketing theory knowledge and the quite sole marketing way, the majority of stadiums provide passive service of ordering courts depending on the customer's visit or telephone inquiry, unsuitable for the current social, economical and the science and technology development level, which has not only drained partial customers but also not satisfied the individuality service needs. Seen from the current management methods of the tennis stadium, the majority are experienced accepting the customer in passive, which cannot grasp the customers effectively and has caused the management losses, therefore it is necessary to use the correlated management theory to instruct and manage the tennis stadium. The customer relations management idea, taking ""the customer as the center"", embodies in the service trade incisively and has something in common with the tennis stadium management. The tennis stadium pursues customer and service first, the customer value realization and the profit maximization. Good customer relations are important resources by which the tennis stadium can survive and develop. In order to obtain satisfied customer relations, for the tennis stadium, the important thinking is through the customer relations management and using the brand-new management idea to survive and develop in the competition.

Since 1990s, a new nationalism movement has been resurged in China and proved to be one of the most important powers which affect Chinese society. How to judge this new nationalism is a very important question. This essay will analyze China's new nationalism from the view of nationalism movement. In history, nationalism was initially appeared in China following western's intrusion since the first Opium War. Since then nationalism developed very fast and played a key role for China's social changes. The new nationalism in China since 1990s was occurred under the background of post cold war era, which manifested in international level as globalization and world new nationalism tide and in domestic level as ideology crisis and China's rise. These backgrounds mean a lot for us to understand China's new nationalism. The main reasons of the revival of Chinese nationalism could be summarized as: the stimulation of conflicts between China and foreign countries, the inspiration of China's rise, and the impetus of the government and intellectuals. When analyzing the contents of China' new nationalism, we could find: that the main objectives of China's nationalism are China's reunification and China's mighty, which means that nationalism mainly is a supporter to China's state building; that the ordinary people play a central role in nationalism movements and their actions mainly come from plain patriotic emotion, which brings both support and challenge to the government; that internet plays a more and more important role for the development of Chinese nationalism; and that we could not talk nationalism without reference to modernization, in China today, the combine of nationalism with authoritarianism might be the way for China to achieve modernization. China's new nationalism has been developed very fast since its revival in 1990s, it is now one of the most important factors which affect society.

This has affect the target to achieve in the value of films in overseas markets is less than in the domestic markets. Today, this devalue prevails in the film industry. This has being called the phenomenon of the film's cultural discount, and this phenomenon in various countries are on different degree. When the film moved into industrialization era, the film cross--border movement has being increased in large scale. The movement not only using the film as a commodity, it also involved the technical staff, the actors, the capital, the production, the issuing and etc. In short, it is involving the operation mechanism of the film industry. Movies in the modern society have been produced, circulated and consumed. The process documented and proves the organic existence of the modern technology, economic and social processes in the film there. With this context, the study of the films perspective fields has also been expanded widely. The aesthetics of film history has always been the mainstream of film studies. Recently, researchers study into the perspective of political economy has been gradually increased, communication theory and research methods for the movie have also been broaden the horizons. The perspective and methods of interdisciplinary integration has increasingly shown its necessity, it gradually become a new trend in the frontier of film studies. In this paper, the research on the interdisciplinary view has adopted the comparative research, constructed and quantitative analysis, to study the widespread of culture discount in the international film trade, joint cultural and economic fields. This is to have a creative interpretation in the film culture discount reasons thru the economic model guidance In the paper, the first part presents an overview of the worldwide film market and the current development of Chinese film. It discussed the theoretical background of cultural discount, and summarizes its' causes.

And it was prevailled in China for more than twenty years. The main content includes the patriotic educational spirit of criticism of traditional education of liberal arts, the propaganda of military spirit, having reserve soldiers among the people, turnning the entire nation into soldiers. Militarism has been long endured in the Chinese nation as a convention. In the critical period of our nation, the advanced intellects realized the importance of militarism and the overall healthy quality of the entire people of our nation. As a reasult, they began to advocate the militarism education. It was analysed that the main reasons of the rising of militarism education are the influence of international militarism, social Darwinism, anti-russia movement. The advocation of peace also leads to the decline of militarism education. Under the visual field of trend of thought in militarism education, personages in all fields of society, especially for Kang Youwei, began to know the significance of Physical Education. In his educational thoughts, the three elements of the thoughts of military physical education for a prosperous country with a powerful army, the school physical education for ""moral, intellectual. and physical"" , and the feminine physical education constitute a creative, special physical ideological system. During the period of the end of Qing dynasty and the beginning of the Republic of China, our nation's society has changed fundamentally. Different classes in China introduced the thought of militarism education for different purposes. And they put all these thought into use in school physical education and formed the militarism school physical education with Chinese features, which is found to be the military exercises. It helped the social developments and promoted the process of standardization of our nation's school physical education, and established the fundation of physical education in our country's overall education initially. In further study, it was found that the trend of thought in militarism education has changed the traditional concept of despising physical education, spurred the changing of school education concepts, promoted the reforms in educational content and methods, enriched the content of school education, pushed forward the popularization of school physical",1870345888,,Dissertations & Theses," Qi, Jian MinQiMinJianQi, Jian Min",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315949281 , 111112692 , 189128 , 10434408 , 10434408", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870345888?accountid=14496, 0520 Education history, 0520 Education history, 0520 Education history,, 0520 Education history, Education history," (UMI)AAI10434408 , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Trend+of+thought+in+militarismeducation+and+its+influence+on+school+physical+education&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Qi%2C+Jian+Min&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Impacts of the spatial variation of hydraulic conductivity on the groundwater recharge,"Translation from original language as provided by author Groundwater is an important component of the global water resources and hydrological circulation. With the rapid economic development, the demand of the groundwater is gradually increasing. However, the exploitation of groundwater development is in the absence of macro-planning and scientific management. The excessive exploitation of the groundwater results in a series of environmental problems. At present, because of the water shortage, the problems caused by a large number of excessive excration of the groundwater in the north china plain have a aerious impact on regional economic and social sustainable development which inclucde large funnel, seawter intrusion and regional ecological degradation and so on.The rainfall-recharge is a major supply of the shallow groundwater resources. It is one of the main factors of the regional water balance and basic parameters of the shallow groundwater. Accurate assessment of rainfall infiltration recharge has important theoretical significance and practical application.As a tradition method to solve the groundwater flow and solute transport modeling, there has been a large resarach results of the deterministic method, and have been applied to solve practical problems. However, the spatial variability of the hydrogeological parameters leads to uncertainly of the water flow and solute transport in the saturated and unsaturated aquifer. Among them, the permeability coefficient is an important parameter of the groundwater flow simulation. The study of the impacts of the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity on the groundwater flow movement has great significance.At present, the statistical theory and methods are widely used to describe the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity. Based on the variation fuction, this theory uses some simuation methods to describe the spatial varibality of the spatial variation of the Regional variables. These methods can be divided into Simple interpolation method (kriging) and sochastic simulation method (turning bands method, sequential Gaussian simulation and so on). Many studies have shown that the log-normal distribution can be used to describe the Permeability of porous media. The variance of the permeability is an important parameter which characterices the size of its spatial variability. The Monte Carlo method is the most direct numerical method used to solve stochastic simulation of groundwater flow. The basic idea of the method is generating a large number of the realizations of the input parameters by certain sampling techniques. For each realization, solving the problem the existing deterministic numerical methods are used solve the problem. Through a large number of numerical simulations, the statistical snalysis of all numerical results can determine the mean, variance, and a variety of statistics of The unknown variables.In this paper, considering the actual weather and hydrological conditions and in the North China Plain, based on the deterministic model of the water movement in the two-dimensional saturated - unsaturated media (SWMS_2D), Considering the spatial variability of hydraulic conductivity, the impacts of the mean and variance of the hydraulic conductivity on the water movement is studied, then the impacts of the variance of the hydraulic conductivity on the rainfall-recharge is getted.The study shows that the mean and variance of the hydraulic conductivity have significant impact on the rainfall-recharge. The shape of the heterogeneous geology is banded or layered. The greater the variance of the permeability coefficient, the stronger the heterogeneity, the more difficult water infiltration, there is less rainfall-recharge. The structure of the mean and the variance of the hydraulic conductivity have significant impact on the rainfall-recharge. When the mean and variance of a certain combination appears, the water channel can generate greater",1870346317,,Dissertations & Theses," Deng, Ming LiangDengLiangMingDeng, Ming Liang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4315951601 , 70613702 , 189128 , 10371011 , 10371011", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870346317?accountid=14496, 0548 Mechanical engineering, 0548 Mechanical engineering, 0548 Mechanical engineering,, 0548 Mechanical engineering, Mechanical engineering," (UMI)AAI10371011 , Applied sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Impacts+of+the+spatial+variation+of+hydraulic+conductivity+on+the+groundwater+recharge&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Deng%2C+Ming+Liang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study on domestic corporate social responsibility information disclosure: from the side of international convergence,"Translation from original language as provided by author Corporate social responsibility and the CSR information disclosure is the inevitable product of the times. In recent decades,as the world's growing economy environmental pollution, a range of social issues increasingly highlighted.Thus,social responsibility movements have a certain theoretical and practical basis Western countries. With the economic globalization continue to step forward,CSR has been international and standardizied practice. The GRI Guidelines and the AA1000 Assurance Standard has become accepted and used widely.As for the disclosure model, many are using the narrative-based model except for dependent based in traditional financial reports and independent report. As the acceleration of economy globalization, the CSR has been introducted in China in 90's.CSR information disclosure in China entered a rapid development stage after 2006. This paper selected the top 100 companies of the CSR Development Index as a sample on the current status of CSR information disclosure, and found that although our country has an increasing awareness of CSR, the CSR information disclosure has a very uneven distribution, the structure and content may be random, the overall quality is not high, it must be payed attentions and improved. Therefore, the Construction of CSR Information Disclosure basic framework and to achieve international convergence for enterprises is of great practical significance. According to stakeholder theory and the triple bottom line theory, on the basis of the analysis of stakeholders'CSR information needs, drawing the conceptual framework of financial accounting theory,the paper has constructed a CSR information disclosure basic framework. The framework is divided into four levels.The 1st level is sbout CSR information disclosure targets and objectives. The 2nd level is about CSR information disclosure principles and basic content.the 3rd level is CSR information disclosure form, frequency and channels.The 4th level is about assurance and follow-up items of the CSR information after the disclosure. Because every Chinese enterprise has different status, the paper proposed the ""two points"" ""three-step"" convergence path, which through the Bottom Line model, the Transition Model to the Beyond Model, to achieve convergence with the GRI Guidelines. At the end, the paper makes some recommendations in improving CSR in China's information disclosure system Firstly, the contents and scope of CSR information should be clear .secondly, the government should improve the related legislation, companies should strengthen the social responsibility management in their daily practice, the academic circles should be overcome the problem of CSR Accounting as soon as possible. Finally, we should strengthen CSR information evaluation and assurance mechanisms, and raise the CSR awareness of community to supervise enterprises to improve the CSR information",1870385354,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, Feng PingLiPingFengLi, Feng Ping",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4316165131 , 111134442 , 189128 , 10437025 , 10437025", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870385354?accountid=14496, 0272 Accounting, 0272 Accounting, 0272 Accounting,, 0272 Accounting, Accounting," (UMI)AAI10437025 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Study+on+domestic+corporate+social+responsibility+information+disclosure%3A+from+the+side+of+international+convergence&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Feng+Ping&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Analysis on contribution of highway transportation to economic development of tibet,"Translation from original language as provided by author Transportation is the ligament that contacts social economic activities of the geographical space and it is the fundamental guarantee that realizes the social division. Public transportation is considered as the lifeline for national economy and the essential industry for the social development. Especially for Tibet, where the economy is relatively backward, it has been playing an important role in the recent economic and social development. Currently, there have been not too many studies between highway transportation with economic development relationship in Tibet. And, most former studies focused on qualitative research and static study, and few study the development and changes of the highway transportation to the influence of the Tibet economic development on the dynamic. So, in this paper, based on years of statistical data, using statistical analysis software, this dissertation analyzed quantitative the contribution of highway transportation to the regional economic increase in Tibet, which has important theoretical value and practical significance to the policy formulation of the regional economic development and the optimization of highway transport network of Tibet. In this paper, based on tracking, analyzing, summarizing the research in the same field both at home and abroad, it focuses on the total regions of the Tibet for the study, using Elastic analysis, Path analysis, Regression analysis and other, analyzed quantitative the contribution of highway transportation to the regional economic increase and economic development in Tibet, measured the contribution rate. The main contents of the paper are as follows: (1) A comprehensive literature review was conducted on the related theories concerning the relationship between highway transportation and regional economic development. After clarifying the concepts of highway transportation and regional economy, this dissertation analyzed theoretically the influence of regional economic development on the highway transportation development and the influence of highway transportation on the regional economic increase, regional industrial restructuring, regional distribution of productive forces, and interregional linkages, which would provide a theoretical basis for the following quantitative analyses. (2) Based on the introduction of the current economy and highway transportation development in Tibet, this dissertation analyzed qualitatively the contribution of highway transportation to the regional economic increase in Tibet, and analyzed quantitative the contribution of highway transportation to the regional economic increase using by Elastic analysis method. (3) Evaluated quantitatively the contribution of highway transportation to the regional economic increase by the Path Analysis method. A multiple regression analysis was then carried out to evaluate the contribution of highway transportation to industrial restructuring in Tibet and interregional linkages with other regions. (4) In light of the quantitative findings above and the estimated development of highway transportation in Tibet, policy recommendations were provided in order to ensure the highway transportation better fulfill the need of economic development and better play its guiding and promoting role. The major research conclusions of this paper are: (1) In the overall transport system, whether freight or passenger transport, most of the period, the economic elastic coefficient of highway transportation is higher than that of total transportation. This indicates that highway transportation is the main transport system in Tibet, and it made a larger contribution on the economic growth. (2) Total length of highway contribution to the regional economy is more significant on all aspects of the region's, in analysis of Tibet highway transportation contribution to regional economic development. Multiple regression analysis showed that highway freight transportation has not been affected fully in all aspects of Tibet's regional economic development. There have some reasons. Firstly, the scale of primary industry is small in Tibet, and families economic is mainly in agricultural trade. Secondly, the scale of secondary industry is small too, the market of consumed industrial products is small, and the majority of industrial products sell out of Tibet by air transportation or rail transportation. Finally, tourism is the most important in the tertiary industry as the most developed, and personnel movement is main content of the tourism. Although the passenger transportation reflects the contribution of various aspects in regional economic development, but the contribution rate was not high. Except the same reason which is the freight transportation did not reflect contribution, there is another reason that air transport and the Qinghai-Tibet railway share considerable part of transportation task in tourism which is the main industry of tertiary industry, and tourism accounts a large proportion of the trade of international and domestic. So, the contribution rate is not large which highway passenger transportation contribute on three industries and interregional linkages include domestic and international trade.

Vietnam and India were far more than neighbors in geography. During the Liberation Movement in 20s century, Vietnam and India mutually coordinated each other to establish deep friendship in struggling for national independence. Since independently establishing states, Vietnam and India walked a winding road in bilateral relations as segregation of north and South Vietnam, bilateral difference of social regimes and influence of the Cold War. However, Vietnam and India never broke connections. In 1970s, bilateral relations worked better in fully development due to the Cold War structure changed, the U.S. invaded the Vietnam and India-U.S. broke up. Since the end of the Cold War, Vietnam and India made adjustment of bilateral diplomatic strategy. India implemented the Look East Policy for the East Asian Area and enhanced cooperation with Vietnam in politics, economy, culture and scientific technology. As a result, bilateral relations furthered up to strategic height. With the development of economic globalization, Vietnam and India developed relations in all-dimensional and multi-ranging directions. Vietnam and India relations as a whole worked well with ups and downs. As a Vietnamese overseas student, the writer kept an eye on Vietnam-India relations for a long time. In my opinion, political relations were close but economic relations fell behind in Vietnam-India diplomacy. Bilateral trade lost balance displaying as ""Cold Politics and Hot Economy"". Besides, the international structure exerted obvisouly influence to bilateral relation developments of broader partnership. In the context of understanding history and reality of bilateral relations especially the characteristics of Vietnam-India relations since the Cold War, this paper analyzed advantages and disadvantages of bilateral relations in order to explore potential of bilateral cooperation and compete for dominant postion in international cooperation.

Current theoretical and practical circles have reached a basic consensus that enterprise is an important part of society and in the course of business occupies certain social resources, so it must undertake CSR. Since the 1990s, issues of CSR have been universal concern. The government and institutional organizations has issued a series of standards of corporate social responsibility which includes establishment of the European CSR Association, SA8000, ""Global Compact"" and ""the UN global agreement"" etc. It has launched a global movement of CSR. China has accelerated the pace of CSR's research and specifications, but due to late start Chinese corporates' attitude toward CSR is relatively passive.The CSR problems are highlighted which mainly concentrated in occupational safety, labor contract, insurance and work overtime, consumers' rights and interests, environmental problems and public welfare etc. Therefore, scholars have been studying how to make active rather than passive social responsibilities, trying to find power to fulfill corporate social responsibility, so as to realize the win-win situation of enterprise and society. In the past relevant literature, the content is divided into two categories: the first is the relationship between the life cycle and corporate social responsibility that mainly from the theoretical point of view explores corporate social responsibility strategic choice combined with features of life cycle in the different stages;the second category is the correlation between CSR and financial performance and empirical results are positive, negative and irrelevant. Enterprise's capacity is the premise to implement CSR,so this article will discuss he relationship between CSR and financial performance combined with Enterprise Life Cycle, trying to find much more practical power of the implementation of CSR, which is the starting point of this article. The article consists of enterprise classification by life cycle stage and for different stages study the relationship between CSR and financial performance. The division method of corporate life cycle used in this paper is currently accepted division, namely entrepreneurial stage, growth, maturity and recession. CSR index system is mainly based on stakeholder theory.This paper studies the listed manufacturing company, so the classification of Life cycle of the enterprise will be divided into growth, maturity and recession.CSR Index is based on the perspective of the definition of cash basis which can actually reflect the CSR fulfillment of stakeholders. Financial performance index is mainly considered from the profitability, solvency, asset management and development capabilities. 750 manufacturing companies in 2008 listed in Shanghai and Shenzhen capital market are selected as samples.186 enterprises are in their growth, mature companies are 256, 308 enterprises are recession.This article take the regression analysis respectively by different stages of the life cycle which make the financial performance as the dependent variable and indexes of CSR as independent variables. Empirical studies indicate that in different lifecycle stages the influences of CSR on financial performance are not identical and how internal and external CSR in the same life cycle stages affect financial performance of the enterprise is not entirely the same. Empirical results of the study reflect the same point expressed in: the impact of external CSR on the profitability of the business; influence of CSR on asset management; the impact of internal CSR on ability of business growth. In addition to similarities, the result of empirical studies also found that: social responsibility negatively related to profitability in mature enterprises; different external CSR effect diversely on the solvency in recession enterprises; external CSR negatively related to growth in the growth stage of enterprises. The implementation of CSR should be based on the premise of the capacity of enterprises,so businesses should consider the similarities and differences of the impact of CSR on financial performance in the different life cycle stages. For the same point, at different life cycle stages the focus of business attention is different.The emphasis in the mature stage is taken much more on investor responsibility, but in recession phase the corporates focus more on the obligation of government. This article provided some references that how companies fulfill their social responsibility. At different stages in the life cycle the impact of CSR on the financial performance which includes profitability, solvency, asset management capabilities and ability to grow are diverse; the influence of internal and external CSR on financial performance of the enterprise is not entirely the same, so enterprises should take the strategic choices of social responsibility combined with their own stage of life cycle and operational",1870558934,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, NanLiNanLi, Nan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4316199021 , 111134442 , 189128 , 10437602 , 10437602", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1870558934?accountid=14496, 0272 Accounting, 0272 Accounting, 0272 Accounting,, 0272 Accounting, Accounting," (UMI)AAI10437602 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Empirical+study+on+the+relationship+between+implementation+of+corporate+social+responsibility+and+financial+performance+from+enterprise+life+cycle+perspective--based+on+listed+manufacturing+companies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Nan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study of the impact of tv sports dissemination on the sports values of urban residents,"Translation from original language as provided by author With the information age, television and sports are getting closer, the advent of television to expand the impact of sports, sports its own unique charm to win hundreds of millions of TV viewers.

In order to maintain the sustainable use of groundwater, we should utilize the groundwater scientifically and reasonably, so we should understand its recharge, runoff and discharge condition, and study on its traveling laws. The parameters of natural porous media usually have complicated distribution, that restricts the description of soil characteristic parameters accurately, so deterministic methods have very great limitation to solve uncertain groundwater movement problems, the stochastic methods must be used. The stochastic simulation of groundwater movement is almost based on the random field, which contributes to intensively understanding the groundwater movement. But the method has complex operation. In practical work, it is difficult to obtain the distribution characteristics of random field. So the method of random field has finite application prospect for the practical work. Recently, many practical problems use the random variable to reflect the constant interval and distribution form for the parameters. In this dissertation, the stochastic collocaion method is introduced to discuss the numerical method for groundwater flow and solute transport which based on the random distribution of medium parameters. The key issues in stochastic simulation are revealed by the theoretical analysis and numerical experiments. This dissertarion mainly includes as following research contents: Firstly, this dissertation presents the background and improtance of stochastic numerical methods for groundwater flow and solute transport. A brief riview about the development history of stochastic theories is given. The scientific problems which need further study are proposed. We collect the related theoretical knowledge for the uncertainty analysis to describe the theoretical basis of stochastic simulation. Some related concepts and models which will be needed in this dissertation. Beside, the simulation method for groundwater movement which based on the random field is analysed and the monte carlo method as reference is also introduced. Secondly, this work gives comparision about the simulation way of random field and random variable, then analyses the feasibility for the latter way to study. The course that introduces the stochastic collocation technology to the numerical solution of stochastic partial differential equation is described. Next, we introduce some basic concepts such as interpolation and numerical integration which will be used during the next derivation. After analysing the tensor product collocation simply, the related problems of sparse grid collocation method are derived, such as calculation formula, data processing method and program implementation framework. Thirdly, in order to verificate the model based on the random variable for the simulation, some numerical examples are given. We study the single-partition and multi-parameter examlpe for the unsaturated water flow movement at first. The model under the condition of parameter correlation is built, and then the analysis of example is done. Meanwhile, in order to verificate the model deeply, a two dimensional solute trasport example is study. Because of this, some results is obtained. Fourthly, some preliminary applications for the model are carried out. Using the stochastic collocation method, the underground water pollution assessment is made with the referrence of monte carlo method. In this method, the realizations of concentration are obtained by the sampling of polynomial, while obtained by solving flow and solute equation in the method of monte carlo. Besides, the model is applied to the risk assessment at the investment project. Lastly, the main research results are summarized, and the issues that need further investigation are outlined.

Since India's growth is involving her more and more with economic,political developments in Asia and the rest of the world,A series of complex questions such as energy and maritime security and international terrorism mingled with domestic social issues,all are challenging the India's national security. To meet the challenges means that it is necessary to look at the development of India's security idea. The Congress Party beat the BJP and win the election in May,2004.The Congress-led coalition government came into power and Manmohan Singh took office Prime Minister from then on. In the administration of Mr Singh's government, the integration of traditional strategy and real factors,with Manmohan Singh's moderation and prudence,making the security idea which is full of inclusiveness come into being, which has broadened the definition of India's security interests and expanded its strategic vision,most noticeably in Asia. The security idea means there are several areas of issues that Mr Singh's government need to ponder over. Firstly,India's first priority should be socio-economic development. In practice it highlights further economic reform to strengthen India's own strength,and emphasizes developing relations with other countries within economic connection especially energy framework. Secondly,India needs to develop its defense capability to meet internal security challenge. Naxalite movement and separatism from NE India become increasingly one of the key concerns. After the Mumbai bombings in October 2008,the threat of terrorism can be further enlarged,and this event exposed a fact about the vulnerability of homeland security. The focus really should be on homeland security. Thirdly,India must develop relations with The US,China,Pakistan,other areas and countries on a level from the strategy. Mr Singh's government understand the importance of Indo-US relations,and view a strong strategic relationship with the U.S. as essential for India to achieve its security conceptions,and want to develop security cooperation with the US. As to the relationship between India and Pakistan,Singh persist in pushing forward the peace process and show restraint about disputes. Mr Singh's government has taken the policy of engagement and balance towards China. Bilateral economic and trade relationship between India and China is improved obviously. But India regard China as a strategic adversary in several areas. And it aslo believe that India must maintain its strategic autonomy through an extended strategic neighborhood. So India has pursued to expand partnerships with these countries from multiple directions. Fourthly,India should become much more deeply engaged in global affairs to increase its global influence and status and achieve its great-power ambitions. In recent years India is very thirsty to be considered a global player and receive the recognition of India's role as one of the leaders in a multipolar world. This quest has become more active and flexible in the service of Singh's",1873848493,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, XuZhangXuZhang, Xu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318185041 , 111119592 , 189128 , 10365141 , 10365141", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, Chinese, Chinese,,2010,PQDT - Global,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873848493?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," (UMI)AAI10365141 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+security+idea+of+the+manmohan+singh+administration&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Xu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Enforcing boundaries: Globalization, state power and the geography of cross -border consumption in Tijuana, Mexico","In her dissertation Magalí Murià studies how policies of territorial control at the border have affected everyday life in Tijuana, reorganizing practices of consumption. She argues that regarding consumption, this border city has undergone a process of infrastructural and cultural integration with Mexico, as well as a physical detachment from the binational region in which it is immersed. Paradoxically, this process was accentuated by NAFTA, since the intensified cross-border flow of goods came accompanied by restrictions to the movement of people, placing border populations at a crossroads between opposing forces of openness and closure. Based on an ethnography combined with historical research, this dissertation addresses how public policy in the region has reshaped local markets. It also shows how Tijuana residents connect, through the goods they buy and the places where they consume, to Mexico and the United States. By examining patterns of consumption, it exposes some of the systems of difference and exclusion that nation states have introduced and enforced. She also explains how physical barriers that restrict crossborder mobility rearrange identities and boundaries both between north and south, and within border cities. This has reorganized social relations in Tijuana, and changed how Tijuanenses relate to the space where they live. This work contributes to the debate about the role of nation states and borders in the global economy, from the perspective of Tijuana residents, who have seen their everyday life increasingly conditioned by manifestations of state power and a more impenetrable border.",193503000,,Dissertations & Theses," Muria Tunon, MagaliMuria TunonMagaliMuria Tunon, Magali",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2002206351 , 50747951 , 66569 , 9781109686722 , 3397196 , 3397196", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109686722, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/193503000?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0459 Communication , 0601 International Relations"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0459 Communication , 0601 International Relations"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0459 Communication , 0601 International Relations",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0366 Geography , 0459 Communication , 0601 International Relations"," Cultural anthropology , Geography , Communication , International Relations"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Consumption , Cross-border consumption , Globalization , Mexico , State power , Tijuana , U.S.-Mexico border , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Enforcing+boundaries%3A+Globalization%2C+state+power+and+the+geography+of+cross+-border+consumption+in+Tijuana%2C+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Muria+Tunon%2C+Magali&amp;isbn=9781109686722&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Rusyns of the Carpathians: Competing agendas of identity,"This thesis examines the cultural revival and nation-building movement of the Rusyns, an East Slavic ethnic group whose homeland along the Carpathians straddles the border between the former Soviet Union and the European Union. While in the 19 th century and again after World War I, Rusyns launched national movements, they never gained statehood as did other neighboring nations. Instead, Rusyns remain divided among several European states. During communist rule, they were officially classified as Ukrainians, their closest ethnic neighbors. After the Revolutions of 1989 and the subsequent demise of the Soviet Union, however, the Rusyns have emerged as a cohesive group recognized officially as a national minority in all the countries where they live except for Ukraine. The new Rusyn national movement brought about the revival of an identity once considered irretrievably outdated by reviving Rusyn language, engaging with the nations around them, and creating international organizations to unite all Rusyns. This question is explored here through the lens of liberal nationalism theory, especially as formulated by Yael Tamir, who argues that nations are defined culturally and that a stateless people may achieve self-determination when they live in a state whose institutions provide recognition and space for them to develop unhindered. To examine the extent to which liberal nationalism applies to the Rusyn movement of today and how it competes with other concepts of nationalism among Rusyns and their neighbors, a variety of sources are utilized in this thesis: personal interviews with Rusyns in Slovakia, Serbia, and Ukraine, written histories, demographic data, and analysis of news and social media. The thesis covers four major areas of exploration. The first chapter discusses the history of past Rusyn national movements and the reasons for their failures. The second looks at the official ukrainianization policies of the communist era and their effect on identity and the motivation of those who later became Rusyn activists. The third chapter considers the links between language and nationalism in the Rusyn movement and the important motivating force of the American diaspora. The fourth investigates the unique political and social contexts of individual states where Rusyns live and how this affects their opportunities, goals, and challenges. The case of Rusyns in Ukraine's Transcarpathia and their unique political history are given particular consideration. In conclusion, Rusyns today have a unique opportunity to develop a thriving nation by applying the principles of liberal nationalism. The European Union has made a genuine contribution to the Rusyns in the arena of cultural preservation in its efforts to curb the marginalization of national minorities and promoting diversity as a value. At the same time, Rusyns in Transcarpathia face a difficult political situation which involves them not only in a struggle to define their own identity against Ukrainian national identity, but also involves them in Ukraine's efforts to define and consolidate its own national identity against Russia's resistance to its independence. The combination of historical factors that create a memory of autonomous rule in the region and a closer connection to the problems of Russian and Ukrainian identity have contributed to making dialog and negotiation more difficult as Rusyns work to be recognized in Ukraine. Nevertheless, the small but steady successes of some Rusyn activists in Transcarpathia who reject more fiery nationalist rhetoric and territorial claims that may be perceived to threaten Ukraine show that even there the principles of liberal nationalism may succeed. Ukrainians and Rusyns share the goal of moving closer to Europe. Embracing the values that guide the positive development of Europe's minority policies can thus unite Rusyns as a nation, repair their history of marginalization, and peacefully gain them a place among the peoples of Europe.",276381263,,Dissertations & Theses," Wiktorek, Alexandra C.WiktorekC.AlexandraWiktorek, Alexandra C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2033458951 , 52138841 , 66569 , 9781109734799 , 1475356 , 1475356", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109734799, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/276381263?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0614 Slavic Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0614 Slavic Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0614 Slavic Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0614 Slavic Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Cultural anthropology , Slavic Studies , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Carpathians , Identity , Liberal nationalism , Russia , Rusyn , Serbia , Slovakia , Ukraine",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rusyns+of+the+Carpathians%3A+Competing+agendas+of+identity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wiktorek%2C+Alexandra+C.&amp;isbn=9781109734799&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Managing chaos, 140 characters at a time: How the usage of social media in the 2010 Haiti crisis enhanced disaster relief","In The Charity of Nations, Ian Smilie divides the world of humanitarian relief into three broad sets of people and organizations: The first is composed of those in need--refugees, displaced people, victims of war and famine, people trying to put their lives back together after a cataclysm. The second set is made up of the front-line organizations that minister to them: UN agencies, international and local NGOs, the Red Cross movement, private sector firms, and sometimes the military. The third set is made up of those who pay the bills: mainly the governments of industrialized countries and the individual donors who make contributions to NGOs. (225) The interaction between these sets of people and organizations is crucial to the world's ability to react to humanitarian crises and provide disaster relief. However, enabling collective action among disaster survivors, front-line organizations, and donors has continually proved difficult to disaster relief efforts. In Web 2.0 social media, the world may have found a way to narrow the gaps between these three categories of people and organizations by improving channels of contribution, communication, and coordination. This possibility was widely demonstrated during the massive relief effort that ensued following the 7.0 magnitude earthquake that struck Haiti on January 12, 2010.",276391308,,Dissertations & Theses," Slagh, Christopher LawrenceSlaghLawrenceChristopherSlagh, Christopher Lawrence",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2033425151 , 51557231 , 66569 , 9781109734652 , 1475347 , 1475347", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109734652, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/276391308?accountid=14496," 0630 Public policy , 0646 Web Studies"," 0630 Public policy , 0646 Web Studies"," 0630 Public policy , 0646 Web Studies",," 0630 Public policy , 0646 Web Studies"," Public policy , Web Studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Managing+chaos%2C+140+characters+at+a+time%3A+How+the+usage+of+social+media+in+the+2010+Haiti+crisis+enhanced+disaster+relief&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Slagh%2C+Christopher+Lawrence&amp;isbn=9781109734652&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Voices of contact: Politics of language in urban Amazonian Ecuador,"This dissertation is a study of diverse linguistic resources and contentious identity politics among indigenous Amazonian Kichwas in the city of Tena, Ecuador. Tena is a rapidly developing Amazonian provincial capital city with a long history of interethnic and interlinguistic contact. In recent decades, the course of indigenous Kichwa identity formation has been dramatically altered by increasing urban relocation, a burgeoning international eco-tourism industry, a generational language shift toward Spanish monolingualism, and the introduction of bilingual and intercultural education into native communities. The current era of nationalistic Ecuadorian “interculturality” and cultural tourism have heightened the public visibility of threatened indigenous practices. Paralleling these national social currents has been a growing indigenous activist movement in Ecuador that has very recently introduced a controversial new Kichwa language-planning project in Napo province. The national standard, Unified Kichwa, is currently being socialized into a young population of indigenous students in the Tena region in an effort to create cultural and political solidarity among geographically separate communities. The move has been met with considerable backlash from Tena Kichwas who believe local Amazonian language identity and “natural” socialization practices are under threat of displacement. As part of this fracturing of ideologies surrounding language production and socialization, Tena Kichwas are creating innovative strategies for objectifying marked linguistic forms in order to use them for specific political purposes. The city of Tena has been reconceptualized as an indigenous space for publicly exhibiting opposing identity construction strategies, particularly through the use of new semiotic media, including folkloric performance and mass-communications technology. Language choice, variation and change are becoming very apparently politicized in this unique socio-cultural milieu, where new and old varieties are being symbolically elevated and denigrated through high-profile semiotic work. Language has become a critical site for the intellectualization of cultural change and a key vehicle for asserting rights to self-representation and self-determination. This dissertation combines theoretical and methodological approaches in linguistic anthropology, ethnographic sociolinguistics and discourse analysis to examine language variation, change and ideologization in progress.

The international dispute over the future of the Western Sahara remains unresolved between the Moroccan government that administers the territory and the Sahrawi opposition that seeks self-determination under the leadership of the Polisario Front. In this context, this dissertation explores the lived experience and social memory of Sahrawis affected by conflict, diaspora, and urbanization over the past thirty-five years by examining multivocal expressions of ethnic and gender identity, nationalism, and citizenship in personal narratives and oral poetry in Hassaniyya Arabic. Through modes of everyday speech and verbal performances, Sahrawis living in the undisputed region of Morocco and the disputed Western Sahara exhibit varying political allegiances linked to tribal and national affiliations and political economic factors. Pro-independence activists negotiate public and clandestine aspirations for an independent state with the realities of living under Moroccan administration while refugees in Algeria employ performance genres to appeal for political and humanitarian support in the international community and maintain communication in the Sahrawi diaspora. Intergenerational perspectives between Sahrawis born before and after the 1975 cleavage reveal key divergences between the older generation that retains an active memory of nomadic livelihoods and pre-national tribal organization, the middle generation affected by a massive shift to urban residence and compulsory postcolonial nationalism, and the younger generation raised primarily in urban environments and refugee camps. Across generations, Sahrawi women have retained a prominent role in maintaining tribal and family ties and serving as leaders in nationalist and social movements.",305182780,,Dissertations & Theses," Deubel, Tara FlynnDeubelFlynnTaraDeubel, Tara Flynn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2049085751 , 52225731 , 66569 , 9781109765335 , 3403262 , 3403262", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109765335, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305182780?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies",," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," African Studies , Cultural anthropology , Middle Eastern Studies"," Social sciences , Hassaniyya Arabic , Morocco , North Africa , Oral literature , Sahrawi , Western Sahara",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Between+homeland+and+exile%3A+Poetry%2C+memory%2C+and+identity+in+Sahrawi+communities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Deubel%2C+Tara+Flynn&amp;isbn=9781109765335&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Performing Costa Rica: “El tico” and national identity,"Costa Rica is a small country located in Central America, characterized by having one of the most stable democracies in Latin America. Costa Rica was the first country in the world to officially abolish its armed forces (1949), following the Civil War in 1948. From the time of its foundation as a Republic, Costa Rica has been defined in terms of homogeneity and socio-economic equality. These two features have been recognized as the main elements of the country's national identity, and the reason for Costa Ricans to be perceived as peaceful and happy individuals. This research utilizes the methodological lens of Performance Studies to analyze these iconic elements of Costa Rican national identity and to challenge the view of Costa Rica as a paradise. Even though the international community continues defining this country in the same manner in which it was defined during the second part of the nineteen century, the reality is that during the last three decades this nation has changed so much that the same definition is not adequate anymore. Street violence in the country has become a threat to citizens of all socio-economic classes, taking away their peace and happiness. I analyze this development and the response by the citizens in an attempt to show that Costa Rica is facing an internal conflict that could have devastating effects on its society. Many social movements have formed during the last decade to try to bring Costa Rica back to the nation it was at the beginning of the twentieth century. The most important characteristic of these movements is that they try to unmask the country showing that it is not peaceful in an attempt to recover the peace they believed characterized the Costa Rica of their ancestors.",305183032,,Dissertations & Theses," Berigan, Yadira CordobaBeriganCordobaYadiraBerigan, Yadira Cordoba",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2047604611 , 52438171 , 66569 , 9781109754551 , 3402864 , 3402864", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109754551, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305183032?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," Latin American Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Costa Rica , Happy citizens , National identity , Peaceful citizens , Street violence , Utopia or Dystopia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Performing+Costa+Rica%3A+%E2%80%9CEl+tico%E2%80%9D+and+national+identity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Berigan%2C+Yadira+Cordoba&amp;isbn=9781109754551&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Jewish intellectuals, masculinity, and the making of modern American conservatism, 1930–1980","""Jewish Intellectuals, Masculinity, and the Making of Modern American Conservatism, 1930-1980"" analyzes the journey of a group of influential and mostly Jewish male intellectuals who shifted from liberalism to conservatism in the second half of the twentieth century. They were the founding figures of neoconservatism, a pejorative first coined by Michael Harrington to describe liberals who shifted right in the early 1970s. Though they repeatedly opined that their shift was a response to sixties radicalism, this dissertation analyzes how ethnic identity and gender politics also shaped their political realignments. By examining the ways in which gender concerns were entwined with the writings of these intellectuals on a variety of issues, including Jewish immigrant life, Cold War liberalism, black-Jewish relations, the social movements of the sixties, and foreign policy, this project reveals that neoconservatism emerged from a longer and more complex process than a late 1960s shift in perspective. It thus challenges the neoconservative self-narrative, reified in numerous books and articles and accepted by many scholars, which pinpoints 1960s radicalism as the catalyst of the groups' increasingly conservative politics. In addition, while neoconservatism has in recent years been liked to foreign policy, it was initially a movement sparked by domestic issues. This project links the domestic and international by analyzing how concerns regarding masculinity shaped neoconservatism. Jewish neoconservatives gave intellectual legitimacy to a once enervated American right, which greatly contributed to the success of the conservative movement in the last quarter of the twentieth century. Other branches of conservatism thrived in the postwar years, yet the Jewish contribution helped erase the image of a Republican Party rooted in antiquated racism and isolationism.",305211377,,Dissertations & Theses," Grinberg, Ronnie AvitalGrinbergAvitalRonnieGrinberg, Ronnie Avital",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2038871511 , 52249361 , 66569 , 9781109741438 , 3402173 , 3402173", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109741438, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305211377?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0751 Judaic studies",," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," American history , Womens studies , Gender studies , Judaic studies"," Social sciences , Cold War , Conservatism , Intellectuals , Jewish , Jewish intellectuals , Masculinity , Neoconservatism , New York intellectuals",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Jewish+intellectuals%2C+masculinity%2C+and+the+making+of+modern+American+conservatism%2C+1930%E2%80%931980&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grinberg%2C+Ronnie+Avital&amp;isbn=9781109741438&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Invisible subjects: Asian America in the American imaginary,"Invisible Subjects rereads texts by well-known authors of different ethnicities through recent advances in Asian American studies and historiography. This critical lens allows for the interpretation of overlooked subtleties in the depiction of race in the canon and demonstrates the need to integrate Asian American studies more firmly into mainstream American literary studies. Asian Americans, racialized through bodily appearance, gender roles, and changing international relations, demonstrate the paradoxes of racial logic in the mid-twentieth century. These subjects manipulate economic, erotic, and social modes of racialization that simultaneously embrace and destabilize mainstream American social formations. Focusing particularly on the legal history in which Asian Americans have been shown to have played a disproportionately important role in defining racial issues such as immigration, segregation, and anti-miscegenation law, this project traces gaps in legal logic in which literature imagines different race relations. Four chapters examine major authors William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, Ralph Ellison, and Maxine Hong Kingston in light of both the Asian American presence in their works and the contemporaneous histories of, respectively, the Mississippi Chinese laborers, the Asian domestic servant, the multiracial zoot suiter, and the illegal immigrant, all contextualized among national events like frontier expansion, the Jim Crow era, and World War II. The last chapter treats the literature and history of an explicitly fraught group, the interned Japanese Americans, whose national and cultural identities were crucially debated during WWII. The juxtapositions of history and literature reveal the deep contrasts between the legalities of immigration, citizenship, and labor and the social stereotypes and masquerades through which racialization is also constructed; they also draw connections between the particularities of race relations in various regions and regional literatures of the U.S. to the larger global movements and geopolitical conflicts behind them. The new literary readings brought to light by this history work doubly to redefine our conceptions of the American canon, these specific texts, and the monolithic constructs, such as the nuclear family, the racialized body, whiteness, and America, with which they engage.",305213779,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Heidi KathleenKimKathleenHeidiKim, Heidi Kathleen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2038901421 , 52250451 , 66569 , 9781109741902 , 3402195 , 3402195", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109741902, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305213779?accountid=14496," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Asian American Studies , American literature , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Asian America , Ellison, Ralph , Faulkner, William , Internment , Kingston, Maxine Hong , Melville, Herman , Steinbeck, John",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Invisible+subjects%3A+Asian+America+in+the+American+imaginary&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Heidi+Kathleen&amp;isbn=9781109741902&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The least of these: American Evangelical parachurch missions to the poor, 1947–2005","This dissertation narrates the historical development of American evangelical missions to the poor from 1947-2005 and analyzes the discourse of its main parachurch proponents, especially World Vision, Compassion International, Food for the Hungry, Samaritan's Purse, Sojourners, Evangelicals for Social Action, and the Christian Community Development Association. Although recent scholarship on evangelicalism has been prolific, much of the historical work has focused on earlier periods. Sociological and political scientific scholarship on the postwar period has been attracted mostly to controversies surrounding the Religious Right, leaving evangelicalism's resurgent concern for the poor relatively understudied. This dissertation addresses these lacunae. The study consists of three chronological parts, each marked by a distinctive model of mission to the poor. First, the 1950s were characterized by compassionate charity for individual emergencies, a model that cohered neatly with evangelicalism's individualism and emotionalism. This model should be regarded as the quintessential, bedrock evangelical theory of mission to the poor. It remained strong throughout the entire postwar period. Second, in the 1970s, a strong countercurrent emerged that advocated for penitent protest against structural injustice and underdevelopment. In contrast to the first model, it was distinguished by going against the grain of many aspects of evangelical culture, especially its reflexive patriotism and individualism. Third, in the 1990s, an important movement towards developing potential through hopeful holism gained prominance. Its advocates were confident that their integration of biblical principles with insights from contemporary economic development praxis would contribute to drastic, widespread reductions in poverty. This model signaled a new optimism in evangelicalism's engagement with the broader world. The increasing prominence of missions to the poor within American evangelicalism led to dramatic changes within the movement's worldview: by 2005, evangelicals were mostly unified in their expressed concern for the physical and social needs of the poor, a position that radically reversed their immediate postwar worldview of near-exclusive focus on the spiritual needs of individuals. Nevertheless, missions to the poor also paralleled, reinforced, and hastened the increasing fragmentation of evangelicalism's identity, as each missional model advocated for highly variant approaches to poverty amelioration that were undergirded by diverse sociological political, and theological assumptions.",305240196,,Dissertations & Theses," VanderPol, Gary F.VanderPolF.GaryVanderPol, Gary F.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1967082471 , 50889201 , 66569 , 9781109621846 , 3394704 , 3394704", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109621846, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305240196?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0469 Theology"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0469 Theology"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0469 Theology",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0469 Theology"," Religious history , American history , Theology , Evangelicalism , Religious missions , Low income groups"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Evangelical , Missions , Parachurch , Poverty , World Vision",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+least+of+these%3A+American+Evangelical+parachurch+missions+to+the+poor%2C+1947%E2%80%932005&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=VanderPol%2C+Gary+F.&amp;isbn=9781109621846&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Dead beginnings, dead ends: Circulations of dead women in an era of disposability","At the turn of the millennium the visual landscape is littered with dead women. They appear as spectral presences whose images anchor news reports about their own macabre deaths and comprise the inciting incidents (or “dead beginnings”) that launch countless narratives of disappearance on films and television shows. Using examples from three sites across the visual field—film, television and news, especially through the mediations of the internet—I make the case that these bodies have both a haunting power and a disciplining function. My argument is two-tiered: in the first instance these images, and the huge cultural investment in the contradictory constellation of women, death, and agency in the current context, are the vehicles for the cultural trashing of the stand-in body of second wave feminism, which at its most visible and vocal, was a middle-class and white women’s movement. In the American domestic arena which circulates these images, but also worldwide where they are dispersed, these images and the stories in which they are embedded express the profound ambivalence to social change that the women’s movement endorsed, and that globalization has exploited to its own ends. I argue that women’s gains in social, political and economic life have come with a price, and one effect is this collateral damage in the visual sphere, where it can be seen but not stated as such. While feminism blossomed as an emergent discourse in the 1960s and 1970s, it failed to become a cultural dominant, and instead, by the 2000s has gone all but underground in mainstream cultural sites. Instead, the dead women that litter our visual landscape visualize a form of masculine anger and resentment at the actual gains women have made. Secondly, and in relationship to the contextual moment of globalization, these dead women’s bodies echo and visually further the “discourse of disposable women” (Wright 2006) that guides labor practices worldwide. While women are necessary to the global workforce, by framing them as disposable global corporations are able to exploit women’s labor while at the same time undervalue their contributions. I propose that the media representations under study facilitate this “myth of disposability” (Wright 2006) by time and again depicting women as negligible objects who turn up dead in show after show, on channel after channel, in film after film, across the visual landscape. In an era characterized by mobility and global flows, these images might be said to depict the forced immobility of the world’s increasingly mobile women. That in the current contextual moment a preponderance of women need to be dead before an exploration of their lives, subjectivities and experiences is authorized in mainstream representations points to the rancor and ambivalence with which the feminist project has been met and to our anxieties about women’s place in a changing world.",305242422,,Dissertations & Theses," Dillman, Joanne ClarkeDillmanClarkeJoanneDillman, Joanne Clarke",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 1965223931 , 50847311 , 66569 , 9781109617153 , 3393618 , 3393618", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109617153, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/305242422?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," Womens studies , Mass communications , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Dead women , Disposability , Feminism , Globalization , Visual culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dead+beginnings%2C+dead+ends%3A++Circulations+of+dead+women+in+an+era+of+disposability&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dillman%2C+Joanne+Clarke&amp;isbn=9781109617153&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Seizing domestic tranquility: National military intervention in America, 1866–1940","Since the Whiskey Rebellion, American presidents have directed law enforcement campaigns against domestic protest movements, labor unions, criminal syndicates, and high-profile activists. Ulysses S. Grant fought white supremacist groups during Reconstruction; Grover Cleveland and Rutherford B. Hayes suppressed railroad and miner strikes, and Woodrow Wilson combated perceived domestic communist insurgencies and foreign bandits like Pancho Villa. The link between these ""small emergencies"" is that presidents relied upon the armed forces to suppress them. American political development and presidency research on emergency executive power, coercive force agencies, and the national security state have exploded since the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Few scholars, however, have studied when and why presidents have utilized the office's ""domestic war powers,"" especially authority to use force at home, to confront large-scale social unrest. With original data drawn from thousands of newspaper articles, this dissertation analyzes over 800 domestic conflict events to explore state and national military intervention patterns in the U.S. between 1866 and 1940. It employs econometric techniques and rare-events methodology previously only applied to international conflicts. It argues that American federalism creates a ""security paradox"" for presidents when deciding to use the military as a domestic constabulary. It also posits a theory on the evolution of the laws governing domestic force use, including the Posse Comitatus Act of 1878. This work contributes to ongoing research dealing with executive law enforcement practices under federalism, the development of the national security state, and the origins of the ""modern"" presidency.",366390872,,Dissertations & Theses," Kenney, Daniel A.KenneyA.DanielKenney, Daniel A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2055146391 , 50802341 , 66569 , 9781109767957 , 3403332 , 3403332", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109767957, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/366390872?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Domestic , History , Intervention , Military , Presidents , Violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Seizing+domestic+tranquility%3A+National+military+intervention%0Ain+America%2C+1866%E2%80%931940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kenney%2C+Daniel+A.&amp;isbn=9781109767957&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Labor takes the stage: A musical and social analysis of “Pins and Needles” (1937-1941),"Pins and Needles could not have been a more unlikely hit of the late Depression. Its actors were pure amateurs, the sets were simple, the costumes were from the actor’s closets, and the theatre doubled as an education building for the International Ladies’ Garment Workers’ Union (ILGWU). No major critics came to see the show on opening night, even after being personally invited by the producer. And yet, on 23 January 1938, a mere two months after its opening, Brooks Atkinson, the chief drama critic of the New York Times , lauded it for its wit, humor, and sentiment. How did this musical with disaster written all over it become the highlight of Broadway, and earn a White House Command performance? Primarily the revue succeeded because the writers of the production team were not amateurs like the actors, but professionals. The ILGWU offered them a creative vehicle in which to give voice to their political and social opinions. Though some of the songs and sketches of Pins and Needles contained content found in leftist newspaper headlines of the day, the creators of the show were ever mindful of the socially progressive, yet politically moderate union they were working for. The historical links between organized labor movements and left-wing politics caused the show’s makers to clearly express, for example, their distaste for Communism and Fascism in order to moderate public perceptions of the ILGWU’s former Communist background. This dissertation contains musical and social analyses of all nineteen original sketches and songs, which are broken down into three categories: political songs and sketches, both national and international; sketches about the economy and its effects on workers, and the sketches and songs with social consciousness that dealt more broadly with issues of class, attitude, and taste. All the songs in Pins and Needles were of a popular nature and borrowed musical traits from opera, sentimental songs, dance traditions, parlor songs, Tin Pan Alley songs, and labor choruses (mass choruses). Labor Takes the Stage concludes with a discussion of the original cast’s tour of the United States, and the legacy of Pins and Needles after it closed.",507898995,,Dissertations & Theses," Wright, Trudi AnnWrightAnnTrudiWright, Trudi Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2064666211 , 52925691 , 66569 , 9781109781038 , 3403993 , 3403993", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781109781038, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/507898995?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0510 Economics , 0644 Theater History"," 0413 Music , 0510 Economics , 0644 Theater History"," 0413 Music , 0510 Economics , 0644 Theater History",," 0413 Music , 0510 Economics , 0644 Theater History"," Music , Economics , Theater History"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Broadway , International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union , Labor history , Pins and Needles , Revue , Rome, Harold",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Labor+takes+the+stage%3A+A+musical+and+social+analysis%0Aof+%E2%80%9CPins+and+Needles%E2%80%9D+%281937-1941%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wright%2C+Trudi+Ann&amp;isbn=9781109781038&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The power of the voice: Listening to Mexican and Central American immigrant experiences (1997–2010),"This dissertation examines representations of immigrant experiences in Mexican and Central American cultural texts at the end of the twentieth and beginning of the twenty-first centuries. By examining immigrant experiences through the lenses of testimonial writing, fictional narrative, documentary film, and popular music, this project offers perspectives from multiple interpretive fields and dialogues with recent scholarship on mobility, transnationalism, and border studies. This multi-genre and cultural studies approach allows me to focus on a diverse group of writers and artists who either tell their own immigrant stories or create experience-based narratives by listening to the subaltern and challenging more canonical systems of representation. All of the texts examined here dialogue with Latin America's testimonial tradition, in that they give testimony, often personal and eye-witness accounts, to explore the many social, cultural, political, and individual facets of migration. Moreover, the narratives discussed here use discursive strategies of orality to emphasize the power of voice and, by showcasing immigrant voices, provide a social space for imagining alternative communities that expose “contact zones” in the Americas. Each chapter focuses on a different country and genre to show the convergences and divergences between representations of immigrant experiences. I also discuss reader and audience responses to the different texts by examining reviews and criticisms to better understand the impact of these representations. Chapter 1 draws on debates about testimonio and introduces the theme of orality by looking at the self-representations of Mexican immigrant experiences in the United States in Ramón Tianguis Pérez's Diario de un mojado (2003), J.M. Servín's Por amor al dólar (2006), and Alberto López Fernández's Los perros de Cook Inlet (1998). Chapter 2 examines an aesthetic of orality in postwar fictional narratives about Salvadoran immigrant experiences through close readings of Horacio Castellanos Moya's El asco (1997), Mario Bencastro's Odisea del Norte (1999), and Claudia Hernández’s short story “La han despedido de nuevo” from her collection Olvida uno (2005). Chapter 3 focuses on the performance of affect and orality in four documentaries about Nicaraguan experiences in Costa Rica, thus presenting different perspectives on the less studied phenomenon of intra-regional migration. Chapter 4 ties together the histories, encounters, and communities discussed in the previous chapters by listening to transnational musical representations of Mexican, Salvadoran, and Nicaraguan immigrant experiences. The influence of the Mexican corrido and Latin America's nueva canción are considered in my analysis of the music, lyrics, and audiences of a variety of artists, including the Mexican norteño ensemble Los Tigres del Norte, the Salvadoran group Tex Bronco, and the Nicaraguan singer-songwriter Flor Urbina. Finally, my conclusion sets the stage for future work on representations of immigrant experiences to better understand the movements and migrations that continue to foster encounters between different cultures throughout the Americas and the world.",577657937,,Dissertations & Theses," Thornton, Megan L.ThorntonL.MeganThornton, Megan L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2071720731 , 53125061 , 66569 , 9781124037653 , 3408051 , 3408051", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124037653, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/577657937?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0413 Music , 0900 Film studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0413 Music , 0900 Film studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0413 Music , 0900 Film studies",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0413 Music , 0900 Film studies"," Latin American literature , Music , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Central American cultural production , Cultural production , Cultural studies , Immigrant , Latin American testimonio , Mexican , Mexican cultural production , Migration , Nicaraguan , Orality , Salvadoran",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+power+of+the+voice%3A+Listening+to+Mexican+and+Central+American+immigrant+experiences+%281997%E2%80%932010%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thornton%2C+Megan+L.&amp;isbn=9781124037653&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Youth -generated media in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia,"Broadly defined as self-expressive media and communication artifacts, youth-generated media have become more ubiquitous as media-making tools became cheaper, smaller and more accessible. Moving beyond questions of media effects and consumption, this dissertation explores why and how street racing followers, graffiti artists, web activists, demonstration organizers and others are developing and circulating media artifacts in Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. What motivates them? What type of media are they developing? How do youth conceptualize, execute and distribute their media? What social, economic, cultural contexts are affecting these productions? And what are the implications of youth-generated media on Arab discourse? Drawing on six months of fieldwork, I use a multidisciplinary comparative approach to advance an underrated issue in global media studies. To meet this objective, the dissertation is organized in eight chapters. The first three chapters provide theoretical underpinnings and methodological considerations for an empirically based and theoretically inspired framework to study youth-generated media. Chapters four and five examine specific recent social movements in Lebanon (Independence 05 and July 06 War); while chapters six and seven analyze specific discourses related to Saudi youth leisure time (al-Faragh) and employment policies (Saudization). In their totality, these cases are not an exhaustive list but an illustrative representation of youth-generated media ‘pulsed’ at a particular juncture in Arab youth history.",604235365,,Dissertations & Theses," Khalil, Joseph F.KhalilF.JosephKhalil, Joseph F.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2076818311 , 53190821 , 66569 , 9781124050140 , 3408635 , 3408635", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124050140, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/604235365?accountid=14496," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications",," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," Middle Eastern Studies , Political science , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Alternative media , Arab , Lebanon , Media , Saudi Arabia , Social movements , Television , Youth , Youth-generated media",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Youth+-generated+media+in+Lebanon+and+Saudi+Arabia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khalil%2C+Joseph+F.&amp;isbn=9781124050140&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Depression, subjectivity, and the embodiment of suffering in urban reform China","Depression was once a rare psychiatric disorder in China. However, over the past twenty years the disease-category has come to proliferate at an astounding rate in Chinese psychiatric discourse and everyday clinical practice. For Chinese psychiatry, the importance of instating depression as a legitimate disease-category is part of a larger movement aimed at reshaping the profession largely in line with the norms and practices of the DSM-influenced global psychiatric model. If depression is to be constituted as a legitimate disease, however, Chinese psychiatry above all requires patients. Building on previous work on the medical anthropology of psychiatric disorders in China, in this dissertation I examine the extent to which urban Chinese sufferers integrate depression as a meaningful category within their local lives and daily health practices. Through an ethnographic analysis of everyday bodily emotional language, symptom presentations, and help-seeking behaviors, in the first part of this dissertation I show that, whether conceived as a mood/emotion, symptom, or disorder, and despite massive efforts at raising popular awareness, depression does not possess much cultural relevance for urban Chinese. Yet when personal suffering passes a certain threshold, and often when most other options for medical consultation and treatment have been exhausted, Chinese patients find themselves seeking care at a psychiatric clinic. Given culturally-informed interpretations of suffering that resonate little with the category of depression, in the context of inpatient and outpatient clinical interactions, patients nevertheless permit the establishment of an “ad hoc contract” with psychiatrists that allows for the temporary contextual legitimacy of depression – usually only for the purposes of treatment. Critical to an understanding of Chinese individuals’ experiences of suffering is the lived embodied process of shenti, or “body-person.” In Chinese, the word shenti denotes not simply the “body” or “body-object” as conceived in English and other western European languages. Shenti rather encompasses the life of a body-person situated within active and dynamic subjective, interpersonal, moral, and social and natural worlds. Drawing on more than two years’ ethnographic research, throughout this dissertation the concept of shenti informs my examination of Chinese interpretations of suffering and lived ontologies of emotional life and personal bodily disorder. In the second half of the dissertation, my analysis moves away from the clinical context to analyze the ways in which individuals narrate their suffering. Reading these narratives, I use the language of Lacan to demonstrate the disordered life of sufferers, whose experience frequently takes the form of an incessant dismembering of their own lived subjectivities. Dividing ethnographic materials by “generations” or “cohorts” – namely, “youth” and “middle-age” – I show how the contingencies of historical bodily, social, and economic life in contemporary urban China shape and influence subjectivities of suffering. All too often sufferers are denied any cause for hope or belief that they will ever enjoy what in Chinese cultural terms is defined as “the good life” ( xingfu ). Instead, embodied “crises of value” lead sufferers to focus only upon the likelihood of irremediable subjective failures and deep social isolation, and even – in some cases – contemplations of outright death.",607889496,,Dissertations & Theses," Ingersoll, Jason WilliamIngersollWilliamJasonIngersoll, Jason William",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2078427821 , 51510381 , 66569 , 9781124048819 , 3408543 , 3408543", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124048819, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/607889496?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0347 Mental health"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0347 Mental health"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0347 Mental health",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0347 Mental health"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies , Mental health"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , China , Depression , Embodiment , Lacan , Self , Subjectivity , Urban",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Depression%2C+subjectivity%2C+and+the+embodiment+of+suffering+in+urban+reform+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ingersoll%2C+Jason+William&amp;isbn=9781124048819&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Reading the politics of history in Guatemala's National Police archives,"This work uses the 2005 unearthing of Guatemala's National Police archives — at 75 million pages, the largest secret state document discovery in Latin American history — as an entry point into studying the politics of history. It explores how Guatemala, a post-conflict society deeply scarred after 36 years of brutal civil war (1960-1996), struggles to manage this unprecedented amount of evidence of past state-sponsored crimes. It investigates how dominant narratives of the war years are contested and rewritten by human rights activists based on what the records do, and do not, reveal. Scholarly investigations of the war have left its urban theatre and the police's surgical, political repression understudied. Using historical and anthropological methods, this study makes two main interventions. It writes the National Police, the capital city, and left-wing social movements back into the conflict's history. It also tracks how Guatemalans themselves, both insurgency veterans and young members of the postwar generation, experience the complex process of trying to reconfigure terror archives into implements of social change. The study is rooted in historical research on the urban counterinsurgency and the police, focusing particularly on the police's use of archives as a tool — honed by USAID technical assistance — of social control. However, the research is equally rooted in participant observation and ethnographic analysis of the Project for the Recovery of the National Police Historical Archives, the effort to transform the decayed and disordered piles of records into a powerful body of evidence for human rights prosecutions against wartime military and police officials. It treats archives as shifting sites of political struggle, and it reads the National Police archives for their form, politics, and silences as much as for their content. Based on extensive archival and ethnographic research in Guatemala and the U.S., Reading the Politics of History dialogues with historians, political scientists, archivists, and anthropologists across geographic specialties about the uses of history and archives; transitional justice; the Cold War in Latin America; human rights; non-governmental organizations and international cooperation; state formation; state terror; political violence; police and military structures; post-conflict security reform; and social movements.",613695633,,Dissertations & Theses," Weld, Kirsten AllisonWeldAllisonKirstenWeld, Kirsten Allison",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2084414991 , 53431891 , 66569 , 9781124087900 , 3414969 , 3414969", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124087900, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/613695633?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0336 Latin American history , 0615 Political science"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American history , Political science"," Social sciences , Cold War , Guatemala , Human rights , Political violence , State terror , Uses of history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reading+the+politics+of+history+in+Guatemala%27s+National+Police+archives&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Weld%2C+Kirsten+Allison&amp;isbn=9781124087900&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Printers, papists, and priests: Roman Catholic print culture and the religious underground in Elizabethan England","Recent scholarly attention has turned from narratives of early modern Protestant triumphalism to the ongoing dissident Catholic minority within English society during the Elizabethan institutionalization of a permanent reformation of the national church. A historic focus on the institutional and ecclesiastical histories of Catholics and the Catholic Church in its reaction to Elizabethan persecution has led, in discursive terms, to a corresponding focus on elite religio-political polemics and ecclesiastical apologies, with little corresponding understanding of the material and cultural circumstances surrounding their production, distribution, and consumption within the English Catholic community, or to the emergence of alternative spiritualist works that were also reflective of the aims of the Catholic missionary movement; namely, to provide lay Catholics access to missionary priests and sacramental worship, and to introduce to England the reformed spirituality of a renewed Tridentine Roman Catholicism. While still deprived of ready access to priests and worship, and subjected to an intensifying program of conformity under coercive threats of fine, imprisonment, torture, banishment, and execution, Elizabethan Catholics became increasingly reliant upon a contemporary Catholic literature to provide renewed sources of religious education and spiritual edification, as well as confessional solidarity and survival. This dissertation turns from a pervasive scholarly emphasis on the institutional history of Protestant confessionalization and Catholic decline toward a more social and material cultural reassessment of Catholic life under Elizabeth, as seen through the lens of its illicit print culture. What emerges is a deliberate, though haphazard and generally ineffective, state effort to censor and suppress Catholic texts, and corresponding evidence of sustained access among the laity to Catholic education and literacy, and to the oral and printed transmission of Catholic religious information and culture. The movement's resilience is also reflected in largely successful systems, foreign and domestic, of underground missionary printing and book smuggling, and in empirical evidence of lay Catholic book ownership that, together, reveal a broader identification on the part of Elizabethan Catholics with the renewed international Catholicism of the Church in Rome and the major Catholic polities of Europe.",618780011,,Dissertations & Theses," Havens, Earle AshcroftHavensAshcroftEarleHavens, Earle Ashcroft",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2087265561 , 53477451 , 66569 , 9781124089300 , 3415021 , 3415021", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124089300, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/618780011?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history"," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history"," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history",," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history"," Religious history , European history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Catholic , Catholic Reformation , Elizabethan , England , History of the book , Print culture , Religious underground , Tudor-Stuart England",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Printers%2C+papists%2C+and+priests%3A+Roman+Catholic+print+culture+and+the+religious+underground+in+Elizabethan+England&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Havens%2C+Earle+Ashcroft&amp;isbn=9781124089300&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The fight for freedom must be fought on all fronts: “Liberator” magazine and Black radicalism, 1960–1971","This dissertation investigates the impact of the New York City-based Liberator magazine on the expansion and dissemination of African American political outlooks in the decade between 1960 and 1971. This study explores the history of this magazine as a critical political and cultural formation of these years. Growing out of the tradition of labor, Left-oriented radicalism as well as earlier forms of Black Nationalism at the turn of the 20 th century, the Liberator provided an indispensable forum where many of the national and international concerns facing Black people could be discussed and debated. In its early days as the organ of the short-lived Liberation Committee for Africa and after, Liberator delivered cutting-edge political, social and cultural analyses of Black radicalism. Therefore, in accounting for the transition period between the Civil Rights Movement and Black Power radicalism, I argue that Liberator represents an important example of the strategic efforts of African American intellectuals, artists, and activists to shape autonomous political spaces through the establishment of a radical print culture.",650974944,,Dissertations & Theses," Tinson, Christopher MatthewTinsonMatthewChristopherTinson, Christopher Matthew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2089588921 , 53529141 , 66569 , 9781124073385 , 3409663 , 3409663", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124073385, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/650974944?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0708 Mass communications"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0708 Mass communications"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0708 Mass communications",," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0708 Mass communications"," African American Studies , Black history , American history , Mass communications"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Black Power , Black arts , Black nationalism , Black radicalism , Liberator , Magazine , Pan-Africanism , Radicalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+fight+for+freedom+must+be+fought+on+all+fronts%3A+%E2%80%9CLiberator%E2%80%9D+magazine+and+Black+radicalism%2C+1960%E2%80%931971&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tinson%2C+Christopher+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781124073385&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“With and against cinema”: The Situationist International and the cinematic image,"The Situationist International was a postwar avant-garde in existence from 1957 until 1972 which agitated for a revolutionary social life, free from the tyranny of capitalism's mass-produced “spectacle.” This new life would be lived in unquantifiable units of atmosphere and emotion termed “situations.” Despite their critique of spectacle, the Situationists firmly believed in the contestational power of images: when stolen from the commercial sphere and reused in an alternative context, images could criticize the very values they once enforced. This appropriative strategy was called détournement , and the Situationists singled out cinema as détournement 's ideal medium. They espoused a contestational cinematic form and a new and non-passive type of filmgoing—one in which the physical structures of cinema would be dismantled and moving images would become a supplement of an ongoing “situation.” Situationist writings on the cinema constitute a theory of alternative film form, content and practice. This dissertation examines three historical instances in which the Situationist International worked, according to the key principle of their film theory, “with and against cinema.” The first chapter analyzes Surrealism's influence on cinematic program which the Situationists developed. Surrealist filmgoing and filmmaking was based on a model of experiential suspension, whereas the Situationists offered a cinematic counter model of movement and drift. The second chapter explains the Situationists' animosity towards the stylistic film experimentation of French New Wave directors, and contrasts two films made in 1959 and 1961 by director Alain Resnais with two films made in 1959 and 1961 by Situationist Guy Debord. The third and final chapter demonstrates the resonance that the film form and practice of the cinétract collective had with the Situationist International's ambitions for subversive cinema after France's social revolt of 1968.",654961441,,Dissertations & Theses," Stob, Jennifer FisherStobFisherJenniferStob, Jennifer Fisher",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2089725601 , 53532121 , 66569 , 9781124091990 , 3415332 , 3415332", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124091990, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/654961441?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0900 Film studies"," 0377 Art history , 0900 Film studies"," 0377 Art history , 0900 Film studies",," 0377 Art history , 0900 Film studies"," Art history , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Cinematic image , Debord, Guy , France , Lettrism , New Wave , Resnais, Alain , Situationist International , Surrealism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CWith+and+against+cinema%E2%80%9D%3A++The+Situationist+International+and+the+cinematic+image&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stob%2C+Jennifer+Fisher&amp;isbn=9781124091990&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Nongovernmental organizations and the World Trade Organization,"Since 1995 over 1,700 different NGOs have found ways to engage the WTO. They have submitted unsolicited amicus briefs and attended ministerial conferences en masse, disrupting the organization and aggravating its membership. They have also submitted over 460 position papers and participated in numerous WTO-sponsored symposia. In spite of these observations, very little is actually known about this overall group of NGOs: what causes do they represent and why do they do what they do? The state-centered emphasis of traditional international relations theory struggles to answer these questions. As an alternative, this dissertation seeks answers by profiling these NGOs and utilizing social movement theory in a multi-level framework to explore their motivations.

From the Cold War forward, these formerly separate aspects of American culture have begun to coalesce, using the language of anti-communism and isolationism as the basis for an end times discourse that predicts the subordination of the United States' national and cultural sovereignty to a sinister, trans-national world system. This conspiracy-driven description of a globally integrated system is predicted to act as an obstacle, subverting the United States' divine destiny as a country chosen to lead the world while maintaining separation from other nations. In recent decades, changes in the United States' sexual, racial, and other cultural hierarchies have increased these conspiratorial and millenarian fears, prompting ultra-conservatives to use the widely disseminated anti-communist templates of the Cold War to describe social changes that they have attributed to nefarious foreign influence as well as domestic collaboration from othered elites. In response to such changes, which have been mythologized as precursors to far more oppressive measures by a global system commonly referred to as the New World Order, violent armed groups have arisen, seeking to combat the hidden forces presumed to have orchestrated the cultural changes that they view as an agenda of disenfranchisement and persecution. Apocalyptic and millenarian movements are generally associated with social responses to observable disasters such as famine, war, or economic depression. However this is not the case with the millenarian movements of the American far-right. Through an analysis of these groups' end times fictions (the novels that depict slippery slopes from which perceived social ills lead to the extremity of persecution) the issues that make up the core concerns of American ultra-conservatives are not objective, observable disasters, they are the outcome of cultural alienation at the loss of white privilege and threats to patriarchy. Analysis of the American far-right's end times fiction reveals a literary genre that has evolved from the Cold War's anti-communist hysteria and has since been adapted to address social, political, and economic trends of concern to conservatives ranging from the civil rights era to contemporary trends in the globalization of political and economic institutions. These novels function as foundational fictions – they seek to define the national spirit as well as its demographic and cultural constitution. Using the form of apocalyptic narrative, this national revitalization is portrayed as the outcome of the violent elimination of the Other to establish a monolithic nation variously characterized as singularly white or Christian in the most extreme examples, but always ultra-conservative and evoking an anti-federalist “constitutional” or extreme libertarian attitude towards governmental authority. In recent decades there have been numerous cases that demonstrate the influence that far-right apocalyptic fictions have had on acts of domestic terrorism. Furthermore, these texts and their conspiratorial underpinnings have led to the mainstreaming of millenarian scripts: cues by which current events might be interpreted as indicative of an impending apocalyptic singularity. This singularity is a point of no return that, if properly anticipated and reacted against, might allow members of such an interpretive community to pre-empt the end-times disaster and ensure that the emerging millenarian world is a utopia of their own creation. The dissemination of conspiratorial themes and their ideological assumptions have been mainstreamed by the entertainment and conservative media, making these frames available to audiences beyond the extremist fringes and therefore, making the understanding of these texts and their ability to act as lenses through which the world is understood all the more important.",741029266,,Dissertations & Theses," Pautz, Johann R.PautzR.JohannPautz, Johann R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2105306851 , 53676421 , 66569 , 9781124099026 , 3415240 , 3415240", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124099026, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/741029266?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0591 American literature"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0591 American literature"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0591 American literature",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0591 American literature"," American studies , American history , American literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Anxiety , Domestic terrorism , End times narratives , Globalization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Black+helicopters%2C+blue+helmets%2C+white+fear%3A+Anxiety+of+a+globalized+world+in+the+end+times+narratives+of+the+American+far-right&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pautz%2C+Johann+R.&amp;isbn=9781124099026&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The utility and efficacy of human materialism as an anthropological research strategy for the analysis of sociocultural, economic, and political history","The purpose of this dissertation is to answer four principal questions: (1) are sociocultural systems a proper domain for research utilizing a research strategy founded in scientific principles?; (2) does the anthropological research strategy, Human Materialism, posses sufficient analytical power to address questions arising in the research of sociocultural systems?; (3) can Human Materialism be extended or enriched to improve its efficacy and power in the study of sociocultural systems? (4) The answer to all four of these questions is yes. Human Materialism is an anthropological research strategy based in scientific principles and presenting a universal model of sociocultural systems. The universal model is comprised of an infrastructure, a structure, and a superstructure. The infrastructure is further divided into material, human, and social infrastructural components. The material infrastructure contains the modes of production, technology, tools among other elements. The human infrastructure contains demographic factors such as population, fertility and so on. The social infrastructure contains effective ownership and control of the forces of production as well as persons in positions of political and economic power and their positions. The social structure includes all social organization: family and kinship, as well as political and economic organization and so on. The social infrastructure overlaps and extends into the social structure. This is the location where those persons with political and economic power direct and control cultural transactions. The superstructure contains all ideological components including religion, philosophy, symbols, and rituals among other elements. The author has extended the concept of faction in Human Materialist analysis to include three types of factions and two statuses. Faction types are simple, bridging, or shifting according to their sociocultural role. I classify factions that have been coerced into compliance with the persons of political and economic power as having the status of annexed. I classify all other factions as having voluntary status. Simple factions are voluntary and may be tightly organized or loosely organized. Bridging factions are the most powerful type faction and possess enough political power to bridge over other factions and bind them to the persons of political and economic power who control the bridging faction. Shifting factions are those that shift their loyalty or political influence from one interest to another. Factions take on greater or lesser power and influence in sociocultural systems depending on their manipulation by political and economic leaders or by the mitigation of such manipulation by other participants in the system. The above methodological elements are demonstrated by numerous case studies. These case studies begin with the Ikhwan Movement in Arabia and the case of Nicaragua’s 1984 suit against the United States in the International Court of Justice. The cases then proceed to Jacob Housman and Indian Key to 19 th century Sioux law and finally to terrorism. Regarding terrorism the author recounts his 40 year journey in his quest to understand terrorism. This journey proceeds from the narrow thinking of the young deputy to the more mature thinking of the older anthropologist. The author presents the first ever Human Materialist theory of terrorism. This theory posits that the collision between a state and a terrorist group is really about the struggle over entry into control over the social infrastructure. This is because it is the social infrastructure where the persons of political and economic power reside and where their control of the sociocultural system is directed. This dissertation contributes to anthropological theory, social analysis, terrorism research, and to Florida’s historical record with the study of Indian Key.",742442881,,Dissertations & Theses," Brown, Burton JamesBrownJamesBurtonBrown, Burton James",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2108208161 , 53843211 , 66569 , 9781124130347 , 3416660 , 3416660", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124130347, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/742442881?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0578 History , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0578 History , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0578 History , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0578 History , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , History , Social structure"," Social sciences , Anthropological research , Economic history , Materialism , Political history , Social theory , Sociocultural history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+utility+and+efficacy+of+human+materialism+as+an+anthropological+research+strategy+for+the+analysis+of+sociocultural%2C+economic%2C+and+political+history&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brown%2C+Burton+James&amp;isbn=9781124130347&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Times of courage: Women's NGO movement in Uzbekistan,"The emergence of women’s NGO (Non Governmental Organization) movements within the framework of Uzbekistan’s civil society sector - following independence in 1991 - has stimulated the interest of both domestic and international powers. It has become imperative to understand the conditions under which women’s public leadership flourished following decades of rigid patronage by the one-party system of the Soviet Union. Indeed, despite the marked absence of successfully organized movements in the past, women’s NGOs have nonetheless reached a stage where they have the potential to mobilize unprecedented levels of resources domestically and internationally to advance culturally transformative gender-consciousness and promote social change through gender-based solidarity. Concurrently, the Uzbek State, mindful of the various “Color Revolutions” that have swept through the former Soviet States, and desirous to curb the impact of “Western imperialism” at home, has proceeded to extend a strong legal grip over all voluntary associations and groups, thereby undermining the conception of conventional civil society groups.

It begins by looking at how the leading LGBT social movements in each country understand and prioritize the battle for same-sex unions. These understandings ultimately determine how far reaching an enacted law may go. Next, it explains what the current constitutional and statutory law is in each nation today and through which avenues it potentially could be changed. The second half of the work systematically compares how the LGBT social movement organizations have engaged with the three branches of government to advance their goals. What it finds is that Brazilian LGBT groups have long had elite allies within all three branches of government, but these leaders have not had the institutional capacity to affect change. In Argentina, on the other hand, all three branches have significant institutional powers to change the law, but lesbians and gays have had a harder time securing friends in these positions. The result is that movements in both countries have not yet achieved success. However, some recent changes in both of these southern cone nations have made SSPR a real possibility: the Brazilian Supreme Federal Court, with new and expanded powers, may soon decide in favor of stable unions for same-sex couples. Moreover, allies in the Argentine Senate are expected to soon approve a bill granting full same-sex marriage rights.

To begin, I introduce some of the basic tenets of the media ecology perspective, and provide a brief survey of some of its foundational thinkers. I interrogate how it can be effectively utilised for the purposes of art criticism, particularly in tandem with McLuhan's notion of the 'counter-environment', and in relation to music and musical multi-media in particular. I also give outline to the affect-script theory of Silvan Tomkins, demonstrating how others might use Tomkin's work in the decoding of musical communication. Part 1 - 'Ok Computer' and its Cultural Context. In part one I explore the 'concept album' and its application to Radiohead's work, along with Ok Computer's relation to the genre of science fiction. I provide background to what Neil Postman (1992) outlines as Technopoly, and begin my illustration of how Ok Computer functions as a counter-environment to the cultural conditions that Postman describes. Identifying him as 'Cosmic Man', I note that the album's protagonist alternates between the roles of the superhero and the anti-hero. In relation to the album's opening song 'Airbag', I explore Technopoly's connection to the 'War on Terror', commercial culture, corporate libertarianism, the global movement for change, and to the social and psychic impacts of the electric age. I also attend to Postman's proposition that television is inimical to democracy and literacy and that it is thereby abetting a new species of totalitarianism. In relation to the song's seventh track 'Fitter Happier', I describe Technopoly as it relates to 'globalisation'. Part 2 - 'Ok Computer' as Counter-Environment: the Anti-Hero. Part two explores the songs that feature Cosmic Man as the anti-hero, all of which associate him with invective feelings and violent activity. 'Paranoid Android' connects the phenomenon of information overload to Technopoly, and to its eclipsing of the traditional world-view. The song also portrays our protagonist's intolerance and scapegoating tendencies which I relate to the mimetic theory of René Girard. In this connection, I investigate the character's contempt, simulated also in 'Exit Music (for a film)', whose allusions to the violence of Shakespeare's Romeo And Juliet demonstrate how Cosmic Man provides a poor role model for the next generation, many of whom he would appear to be leading to suicide. Extrapolating the family feud to that within the global village – as 'Airbag' suggests, I correlate Technopoly with what Dwight D. Eisenhower called the military-industrial complex; with recent U.S. estrangement; and with current planetary instability. Cosmic Man's antipathy continues to feature in 'Karma Police', a song in relation to which I discuss some of Technopoly's 'invisible technologies' as well as its association with contemporary strains on identity. These latter culminate in 'Climbing up the Walls' with his personal disintegration, which likewise reflects the unravelling of traditional American society. Part 3 - 'Ok Computer' as Counter-Environment: the Hero. Part three explores the songs that feature Cosmic Man in his heroic mode, beginning with 'Subterranean Homesick Alien', which highlights his estrangement from nature, and the unintended consequences of his technological extensions upon himself, his fellow species, and his habitat. Additionally, it explores his alienation from other people, from information, from truth, from meaningful life and from the humanity of his traditional past particularly as these relate to paranoia and active citizenship, the role of scientism in Technopoly, and to moral questions. 'Let Down' explores Technopoly's debilitating erosion of meta-narratives, as well as the phenomenon I identify as 'egalitarian let down'. Here I investigate Cosmic Man's scripting of happiness, particularly in relation to how Technopoly manifests itself in what has been identified as 'the medicalisation of unhappiness'. In 'Electioneering' I investigate Technoply's global economic and political inequality, and – in association with 'No Surprises' – I explore some of the varying techniques of members of the global movement, along with the aspects of Technopoly they most actively oppose. I also discuss the latter song in relation to television's 'disappearing of childhood', its 'diminution of adulthood', and their connection to Technopoly's general inflation of cheerfulness. Finally, I discuss the apocalypticism of 'Lucky' in relation to Radiohead's ongoing promotion of democratic individualism. Part 4 - Conclusion. While elucidating Technopoly's connection to the technology of money, I illustrate how Ok Computer's final song – 'The Tourist' – expresses Cosmic Man's self-critique at the individual and the cultural level. Probing the connections between literacy and the doctrine of 'non-violence', I evaluate the prospects for a type of 'secondary literacy', along with other potential positive or negative consequences of computer technology. Lastly, I investigate the issue of technology and morality in relation to what has become known as 'the precautionary principle'.

In particular, I unravel the conflation of the “Sapphic” and “lesbian” (conceived by 1980's feminists) and instead engage Sappho's lyric as a particular model of creative awareness rather than as an expression of sexual preference. I draw on W.E.B. Du Bois's and Jack Winkler's definitions of “double consciousness” to define a “Sapphic consciousness” that negotiates a lyrical space between queer and normative expression. Sappho’s poetry resists normative discourses of power by occupying multiple perspectives within one poem, often engaging in a kind of lyrical cross-dressing or transvestism. This often results in a confusion of lyrical subject and object, destabilizing definitions of a marginalized “other.” Both Sappho’s poetry and the selected Modernist texts evoke fluid identities that are tied to gender roles and performance. Modernism's particular evocation of this Sapphic style was fueled by historical, aesthetic, and social factors at the turn of the century during a surge of artistic movements in the midst of continued industrialization and a sense of alienation expressed by growing expatriate communities. The Sapphic voice exists as a palimpsest within Modernism, creating a space where writers found new modes of expression. By contextualizing the Modernist movement within a Sapphic tradition, I interpret the texts through the critical lens of contemporary theorists (Walter Benjamin, Judith Butler, and Michel Foucault) and classical scholars (Ellen Greene and Page duBois). My research opens up the field of Sapphic Modernism by sidelining questions of authorial influence and pursuing fresh transnational comparisons among the works of modernist poets, male and female, such as Emily Dickinson, Charles Baudelaire, Colette, Anna de Noailles, Guillaume Apollinaire, Djuna Barnes, H.D., and W.B.

Existing theories interpret these dispositions in one of two ways: either as genetic traits inherited from hominid ancestors (evolutionary psychology), or as reified elements of cultural practices (social constructivism). Both of these approaches imply that common sense is local and context-dependent, without any primordial components. Nevertheless, rationality cannot emerge in material environments without a set of necessary beliefs. This means that common sense incorporates universal elements as well. By treating shared factual knowledge as subjective and the basic intuitions as objective (not the other way around), it is possible to understand the roots of cultural paradigms and the parameters that lead to their change over time. The interplay between belief and knowledge determines the type of principles that have the strongest appeal in any society. This process works at the level of the individual, especially in the early formative years, and shapes the generational transfer of values. Of special interest is the possibility of cultural change induced by advancements in science. For example, the social relevance of scientific rationality depends on the perceived compatibility between the necessary intuitions and the supported interpretations of physical phenomena. Global effects are possible in the long run, given the universality of relevant categories. Even the modern trend towards cultural fundamentalism can be reversed, assuming favorable conditions. The goal of this dissertation is to provide a foundation for future research on the evolution of common sense. It is designed as an argument in three main steps. The first part aims to deduce the types of internal and external observables that determine the emergence of rational self-consciousness. The second part derives a limited list of physical properties that can be used to validate the ontological status of rationality. Those properties are shown to be compatible with existing empirical observations (but not with their interpretation) in the third part.

I challenge a well-established hypothesis that supports policy convergence based on the experiences of European countries. I argue that significant policy divergence has occurred between Korea and Japan especially when it comes to unskilled foreign workers, while policy convergence has been observed in return migration policies toward ethnic Koreans and Japanese. To explain these puzzles, I propose a historical-institutionalist approach to immigration policy by placing special emphasis on intra-governmental competition and political coalitions between state and social movement organizations (e.g. pro-migrant NGOs) in the policy-making processes. Using data from governmental sources and interviews, I find that political coalitions between state and pro-migrant civic organizations lead to liberal policies toward unskilled foreign workers in Korea, whereas the absence of influence of civil society in the policy-making process makes immigrant policies less liberal and less flexible in Japan. This comparative study outside of traditional western states not only broadens the empirical scope of international migration studies, but also tests whether current migration theories that heavily rely on Euroamerican cases may apply more generally to non-Western cases. For studying other policy areas, my research also can provide new analytical dimension including roles of new social movements in policy domains beyond the traditional view of bureaucracy-led policymaking in Japan and Korea.",751248428,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, ByounghaLeeByounghaLee, Byoungha",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2140353421 , 51682101 , 66569 , 9781124168180 , 3418439 , 3418439", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124168180, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/751248428?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0629 Labor relations , 0700 Social structure"," Asian Studies , Political science , Labor relations , Social structure"," Social sciences , Immigration , Immigration policies , Japan , Korea , Migrant workers , South Korea",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Comparing+immigration+policies+in+Japan+and+Korea%3A+A+historical-institutionalist+approach&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Byoungha&amp;isbn=9781124168180&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Back to the garden: Territory and exchange in western Canadian folk music festivals,"Since the end of the American Folk Revival, in the late 1960s, folk festivals have undergone a dramatic change. Concurrently, folk music was transformed through capital from its origins as national folkloric music to a successful popular music genre. As professional folk music emerged during the late 1950s and 1960s many young people began to get involved. This involvement, often in the promotion of community oriented folk music events, set the stage for the development of independent community folk music clubs and festivals. These two trends (folk music as cultural commodity and folk music as community expression) flowed through one another sweeping away nationalist folk music and leaving an open space. During the 1970s, political and social changes were occurring across North America. The emergence of what Michael Foucault called biopolitics began to change how young people related to the idea of folk music and to the general field of political action. At the same time, organized leftwing political groups, many of which developed out of early 20 th century political movements, broke down or splintered into many smaller groups. Some disenchanted political activists turned towards cultural programming as an outlet for their political desire. Along side this, American draft dodgers and Canadian back-to-the-landers moved, from the south and the east, into the Canadian west. Out of this diverse social energy developed urban and rural folk music festivals. Until now folk music festivals in western Canada have not been systematically surveyed nor has their operation been theorized as a mode of creative production. This work develops a historically grounded approach to folk music as a means of social production and challenges the idea that folk music is only a music genre. I conclude, using a theoretical approach developed by Deleuze and Guattari, that contemporary folk music festivals make use of social capital to establish a folk music assemblage. This assemblage provides an alternative, non-centralized, and increasingly global alternative for the flow of music capital. Folk music is no longer a style of music but a mode of doing business in music that is socially oriented and politically and economically potent.",752062006,,Dissertations & Theses," MacDonald, Michael B.MacDonaldB.MichaelMacDonald, Michael B.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2144070271 , 51966681 , 66569 , 9780494624807 , NR62480 , NR62480", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494624807, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/752062006?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0385 Canadian studies , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0385 Canadian studies , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0385 Canadian studies , 0413 Music",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0385 Canadian studies , 0413 Music"," Cultural anthropology , Canadian studies , Music"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Folk festivals , Music festivals , Social production , Territory",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Back+to+the+garden%3A+Territory+and+exchange+in+western+Canadian+folk+music+festivals&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=MacDonald%2C+Michael+B.&amp;isbn=9780494624807&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Gullet politics: Contentious foie gras politics and the organization of public morality in the United States and France,"This dissertation examines the interplay of social movement communities, market actors, and state systems through a study of the cultural and moral politics surrounding foie gras in the United States and France. In recent years, foie gras (the liver of a force-fed duck or goose) has become a contentious issue for competing interest groups who continue to battle for its symbolic control in the public sphere. While social movements concerned with animal rights vilify foie gras as a product of cruel and inhumane treatment of animals, others defend it as a culinary delicacy, a French tradition, and call it a misguided target for those opposed to animal agriculture, more broadly. I employ a two-fold comparative strategy, based on ethnographic fieldwork; collected archival, legislative, and historical materials; and eighty interviews conducted in the U.S. and France. First, I examine moral entrepreneurship in motivating and responding to the dynamic constellation of legislation, movement activities, and market responses to foie gras politics over time. Second, my cross-national analysis shows that while foie gras has come to be inextricably linked to national distinction and cultural protectionism in France, in the U.S. it maps onto battles over animal rights and over the acceptable purview of government regulation of consumption. Furthermore, competing organizational logics have resulted in the emergence of unintended consequences for each domain. By studying food controversies through a sociological lens, my project speaks to dynamic issues that affect local communities and global markets, cultural traditions and transformations, and moral issues regarding an agro-technological future.",753136324,,Dissertations & Theses," DeSoucey, Michaela AnneDeSouceyAnneMichaelaDeSoucey, Michaela Anne",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2144901761 , 52250051 , 66569 , 9781124184036 , 3419034 , 3419034", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124184036, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/753136324?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," Political science , Social structure , Social change , Political systems , Organizational structure , Morality , United States--US , France"," Social sciences , Culture , Foie gras , Foie gras politics , Food , France , Globalization , Markets , Public morality , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gullet+politics%3A+Contentious+foie+gras+politics+and+the+organization+of+public+morality+in+the+United+States+and+France&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=DeSoucey%2C+Michaela+Anne&amp;isbn=9781124184036&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Articulations of Okinawan indigeneities, activism, and militourism: A study of interdependencies of U.S. and Japanese empires","In this dissertation I explore complex intersections of tourism, militarism, and interdependencies of the U.S. and Japanese empires that have defined Okinawan-ness. I analyze these intersections with an emphasis on contemporary Okinawa since 1972, the year that marked the end of the official U.S. military occupation of Okinawa and a continuation of informal militarized relationship of the two empires. I foreground implications of contemporary Okinawan-ness as it is raced, classed and gendered through the socio-political mechanisms of the U.S. militarism, Japanese imperialism, and tourism. I show that the mechanisms of material and institutional culture, historical approaches, and practices of resistance produced different versions of Okinawan-ness. Suggesting a kind of investigation that looks at Okinawan-ness as a useful category of analysis that helps to understand a continuum of “Okinawan-ness,” I make visible mechanisms of the empires as operating through social and cultural institutions of militarism and tourism while simultaneously modifying and constructing Okinawan-ness. I argue that Okinawans participate in the process of constructing, re-/de-constructing, and consuming Okinawa/n-ness, more or less contemporaneously in response to their social environment as it is constructed by the relationalities among the U.S., Japanese and Okinawans. Each chapter investigates different ways of articulations of Okinawan-ness; as historically situated in relation to Japanese colonialism and U.S. militarism; as articulated in the so-called 3Ks— kokyo koji (public work), kichi (military bases), and kanko (tourism)—which includes the phenomenon of “militourism”; as consumed and re-articulated in two entertainment spaces—American Village and Koza Music Town—as well as through intimate relationships between local women and U.S. servicemen; and as used as a political tool in anti-militarist movements in Okinawa and transnational network, which I call the politics of indigeneities. I argue that Okinawan-ness, as expressed through an Okinawan word uchinanchu and strategic uses of it in the anti-militarist activism, is a form of “direct theory”—a theory that analyzes the interdependencies of the U.S. and Japanese empires through the articulation of Okinawan-ness and at the same time is a form of resistance. Finally, I discuss some implications of anti-militarist activism on other indigenous anti-militarist activists, such as those in Guam.",753507688,,Dissertations & Theses," Ginoza, AyanoGinozaAyanoGinoza, Ayano",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2145022981 , 54527681 , 66569 , 9781124221717 , 3421629 , 3421629", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124221717, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/753507688?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0332 History , 0733 Gender studies , 0750 Military studies"," 0323 American studies , 0332 History , 0733 Gender studies , 0750 Military studies"," 0323 American studies , 0332 History , 0733 Gender studies , 0750 Military studies",," 0323 American studies , 0332 History , 0733 Gender studies , 0750 Military studies"," American studies , History , Gender studies , Military studies"," Social sciences , Empire , Indigeneity , Japan , Militarism , Okinawa , Tourism , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Articulations+of+Okinawan+indigeneities%2C+activism%2C+and+militourism%3A+A+study+of+interdependencies+of+U.S.+and+Japanese+empires&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ginoza%2C+Ayano&amp;isbn=9781124221717&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Pathways to gender equality?

I focus on one particularly active center of Islamic learning at Patani, on the Malay-Thai Peninsula, and how its people forged transnational scholarly networks across much of maritime Asia, the Middle East, and southern Africa. This movement grew out of a fifty-year period of intense warfare during which time the Patani Sultanate was dismembered and destroyed by the expanding Siamese empire, producing a scattered Patani diaspora that stretched from their homeland through the adjacent parts of the peninsula, Sumatra, Borneo, Cambodia, and the Middle East. Before long, a leader emerged in Mecca, Shaykh Dā'ūd bin 'Abd Allah al-Fatānī, whose scholarship became central to the cultural genesis of the diasporan population and served as vibrant and transformative social capital for a rising Islamic elite. Centered in Mecca, the Patani scholarly network reached back into Southeast Asia, where its participants built numerous schools that served as dissemination points for the spread of Islamic texts. This network of scholars continued to grow in number and reached further into the hinterlands of their communities by the last three decades of the nineteenth century. Their work in spreading texts and teachings formed the building blocks for Islamic education in much of what are now Malaysia and southern Thailand, as well as significant portions of Indonesia and Cambodia. Empires, technology, and modernity brought great changes to the scholarly communities by the 1880s, when print culture began to replace the handwritten manuscript tradition. The contest for control of peninsular territories also resulted in the coalescing of the border that now divides Malaysia from Thailand, placing Patani—now Pattani—north of the border and setting the stage for contentious twentieth-century political struggles for autonomy or independence by Malay-speakers in an increasingly Thai nation-state. Nevertheless, the legacy of the Patani scholars continued to be evident in the curricula of Islamic schools throughout the peninsula and other parts of Southeast Asia until at least World War II, and in some regions their texts still form the basis of education systems today.",756021689,,Dissertations & Theses," Bradley, Francis R.BradleyR.FrancisBradley, Francis R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2151725361 , 54671471 , 66569 , 9781124220321 , 3421930 , 3421930", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124220321, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/756021689?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," 0332 History , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," 0332 History , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies",," 0332 History , 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," History , Middle Eastern history , Islamic Studies"," Social sciences , Islamic , Malaysia , Patani School , Revivalism , Social dynamics , Thailand",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+social+dynamics+of+Islamic+revivalism+in+Southeast+Asia%3A+The+rise+of+the+Patani+School%2C+1785%E2%80%931909&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bradley%2C+Francis+R.&amp;isbn=9781124220321&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Transnational identities in national politics: The SPD and the German peace movements, 1921–1966","This dissertation problematizes the relationship between the German Social Democratic Party (SPD) and pacifists on the non-Communist Left between 1921 and 1966. It breaks from traditional master narratives by using gender, transnational, and biographical analysis to reveal under-studied continuities and shifting political spaces in German politics. Part I demonstrates the usefulness of a core/penumbra model for understanding gendered political spaces on the Left and the merits of using biographical analysis to reveal important continuities over the constructed historical divides of 1933 and 1945. Furthermore, this part explores the foundations of ""masculine"" characterizations of party politics and the tensions created by common perceptions that ethical pacifism, originally promoted by Bertha von Suttner's powerful influence, was ""feminine."" Part II highlights case studies of individual activists, what I term cooperative activists, who drove the relationship between the SPD and pacifist initiatives by participating in both party and peace activities throughout this timeframe. In particular, these case studies illustrate three main types of transnational interaction in Germany between 1921 and 1966: awareness, intermittent contact, and direct, interpersonal, reciprocal contact. This focus reveals that although the SPD maintained its reputation as a ""peace party"" during this period of investigation and beyond, party leaders' conception of peace changed over time. By 1961, during Willy Brandt's Chancellor candidacy, party rhetoric shifted to a more ""masculine"" understanding of peace, marking an alternative turning point to party programmatic reforms in 1959. For pacifists, SPD sponsorship of antinuclear activities in the 1950s helped open new political space for extra-parliamentary movements like the Easter Marches during the 1960s. These connections also set the stage for the development of the Green Party in the 1980s which capitalized on the blurred boundaries between extra-parliamentary and party politics.",757228204,,Dissertations & Theses," Rose, Shelley E.RoseE.ShelleyRose, Shelley E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2159206801 , 54819281 , 66569 , 9781124227184 , 3422855 , 3422855", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124227184, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/757228204?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0563 Peace Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0335 European history , 0563 Peace Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0335 European history , 0563 Peace Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0335 European history , 0563 Peace Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," European history , Peace Studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Biography , Gender , Germany , National politics , Pacifism , Peace movements , SPD , Social Democratic Party , Transnational , Transnational identities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+identities+in+national+politics%3A+The+SPD+and+the+German+peace+movements%2C+1921%E2%80%931966&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rose%2C+Shelley+E.&amp;isbn=9781124227184&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Voluntary Simplicity, authentic happiness, and ecological sustainability: An empirical psychological analysis of deliberate reductions in consumption and the cultivation of intrinsic values on subjective well-being in addition to a conceptual exploration regarding the impact of individual simplicity and socio-economic localization on global ecological sustainability","Voluntary Simplicity (VS) is both a lifestyle choice and a cultural movement based upon a system of intrinsic values and goals focused on lightening and unburdening one’s life from things and experiences that interfere with a higher quality of life and, instead, concentrating on the things one genuinely needs and cherishes. This is primarily done by deliberately and mindfully reducing one's consumption of goods and services, living with fewer possessions, cultivating nonmaterialistic sources of satisfaction and meaning and developing deeper connections with one’s social and ecological community. VS practitioners, also known as “downshifters,” work on developing lifestyles aimed at minimizing the traditional pursuit of wealth, conspicuous consumption and the acquisition of possessions, and the attainment of image/status. VS is not a lifestyle of deprivation, however, but rather one of sufficiency or enoughness. The aim of this research was to discern the relationship between VS practice/behavior and happiness (or “subjective well-being,” SWB) at the individual level of analysis. Within this process, a variety of research methodologies were employed including: (1) A comprehensive literature review, (2) National SWB surveys, (3) Extensive interviews and focus groups, and (4) A blog-based self-study. Through the triangulation of these methodologies, the goal of the research was to answer the following question: On average, do Americans who practice Voluntary Simplicity experience higher levels of subjective well-being than the average American? The empirical data collected demonstrates that, on average, Americans who practice Voluntary Simplicity experience approximately 17% to 20% higher levels of subjective well-being than the average American. Support for a strong positive correlation between VS and Ecologically Responsible Behaviors (ERB)/Sustainable Lifestyles (SL) is also provided by additional qualitative evidence. The implications of this research for global ecological sustainability are extensive. The findings may form the basis of a new, mental health-based frame through which SL can be promoted. This, in turn, will help advance fundamental and socio-ecologically critical shifts in human, social, and economic attitudes and behaviors.

This dissertation exposes the logic of gender as it emerges through a detailed examination of the normalization of intersex bodies. While women's studies scholars were among the first to critique the medical model of intersex management for its complicity with processes of gender regulation, recent intersex scholarship and activism has focused almost exclusively on the negative impacts of surgical normalization. One effect of this focus has been a lack of attention to other important considerations, such as the ways in which the medical management of intersexuality is linked with the biopolitical regulation of gender difference more broadly. This dissertation argues that the theories of women's and gender studies reveal that current understandings of intersex are inextricable from gendered relations of power and knowledge. Developing an innovative interdisciplinary methodology that draws upon feminist, queer, and disability theories, textual, discursive, institutional, and genealogical analysis, as well as social movement history, the history of science, and transnational cultural studies, this dissertation's particular contributions lay in its insistence that intersex has fundamentally shaped the history of gender as a concept and practice in twentieth and twenty-first century Western culture; that a critical attention to the history and politics of intersex phenomena productively complicates and reframes dominant understandings of gender, sex, sexuality, and embodiment in biomedical, women's studies, and activist discourses; that feminist, queer, and disability studies frameworks shed new light on key dilemmas and debates in intersex activism and advocacy work; and that historicizing intersex as a category that both precedes and, to a significant degree, inaugurates late modern understandings of gender opens up new perspectives on body politics, health, and normality.",759068306,,Dissertations & Theses," Rubin, DavidRubinDavidRubin, David",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2166859421 , 54968361 , 66569 , 9781124235424 , 3423113 , 3423113", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124235424, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/759068306?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Womens studies , GLBT Studies , Gender studies , Sexual behavior , Anatomy & physiology"," Social sciences , Biomedicine , Feminist theory , Gender , Human rights , Intersex , Intersex activism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Intersex+before+and+after+gender&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rubin%2C+David&amp;isbn=9781124235424&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"GenderWatch,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Examining social determinants of food insecurity, common mental disorders, and motivations among AIDS care volunteers in urban Ethiopia during the 2008 food crisis","By mixing ethnographic and community-based epidemiological methods, this dissertation aims to illuminate the challenges facing AIDS care volunteers in urban Ethiopia, a setting characterized by low income, high rates of food insecurity, and ongoing scale-up of highly-active antiretroviral therapy programs. Shortages of health workers—widely recognized as the greatest threat to global health—are addressed throughout sub-Saharan Africa by using community volunteers. Whether it is unjust and/or unsustainable to rely on volunteerism in such settings has become a major concern for a widening group of social scientists and global health practitioners. This dissertation demonstrates that acute-on-chronic food insecurity during the 2008 global food crisis impacted psychosocial health and motivations to continue volunteering among AIDS care volunteers serving local non-governmental organizations in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. This dissertation also proposes a theory of how volunteers’ pro-social motivations are shaped and sustained by local norms of reciprocity and empathy, as well as by global group rituals organized by the institutions that rely on volunteer labor in rolling out antiretroviral therapies in settings of chronic food insecurity. Participant observation was conducted in neighborhoods adjacent to a large public hospital in southwest Addis Ababa, including attendance at volunteer trainings, caregiver and care recipient homes, volunteers’ reporting and planning meetings, and volunteer recognition ceremonies, over 20 months between May 2007 and January 2009. A purposive sample of 13 volunteer caregivers was recruited to complete a series of semi-structured open-ended interviews. In addition, a random sample of 110 volunteers from two local NGOs was surveyed 3 times over 11 months in 2008. Surveys included measures of food insecurity and common mental disorders, care relationship quality, and motivations for being an AIDS care volunteer. Text analyses, regression analyses, and cultural consensus analyses were triangulated to test hypotheses and interpret results. Results indicate that volunteers faced unrelenting poverty, but they also built positive, empathic relationships with others in their communities. They also expected divine rewards as Orthodox Christians caring for marginalized people. Nevertheless, this dissertation concludes that “volunteerism” is an optimistic and loaded term that oversimplifies the motivations of low-income individuals and potentially masks a system of unsustainable labor exploitation within AIDS treatment and other development-focused movements.",759073581,,Dissertations & Theses," Maes, Kenneth C.MaesC.KennethMaes, Kenneth C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2166891711 , 54969031 , 66569 , 9781124235172 , 3423094 , 3423094", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124235172, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/759073581?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0327 Physical anthropology , 0451 Social psychology , 0573 Public health , 0622 Clinical psychology , 0630 Public policy , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0327 Physical anthropology , 0451 Social psychology , 0573 Public health , 0622 Clinical psychology , 0630 Public policy , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0327 Physical anthropology , 0451 Social psychology , 0573 Public health , 0622 Clinical psychology , 0630 Public policy , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0640 Sustainability",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0327 Physical anthropology , 0451 Social psychology , 0573 Public health , 0622 Clinical psychology , 0630 Public policy , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , Physical anthropology , Social psychology , Public health , Clinical psychology , Public policy , Sub Saharan Africa Studies , Sustainability"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Psychology , Caregiving , Ethiopia , Food insecurity , Global mental health , HIV/AIDS , Labor exploitation , Ritual , Volunteerism , Volunteers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Examining+social+determinants+of+food+insecurity%2C+common+mental+disorders%2C+and+motivations+among+AIDS+care+volunteers+in+urban+Ethiopia+during+the+2008+food+crisis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Maes%2C+Kenneth+C.&amp;isbn=9781124235172&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Developing dreamworlds: The reimagining of mass utopia in spaces of over/underdevelopment,"My dissertation extends political theorist Susan Buck Morss's work on the Benjaminian dreamworlds of modernity. Specifically, I explore how the revised dreamworlds of mass production, culture, and sovereignty re-emerge in contemporary cultural texts of economic development and those of the “movement of movements.” As spaces of arrested economic and political development, these postcolonial enclaves illustrate how the new dreamworlds of incessant consumption and national culture survive in the inhabitants' hopes and in the developers' projects. Diasporas bring those dreamworlds back to the de-industrialized, cynical spaces of overdevelopment, while development projects keep the desires for modernity alive in those in the underdeveloped word: The texts here re-present London housing estates, Juarense border towns, urban American slums, poor English countrysides, remote Indian villages. The late-capitalist shift from industrial to service economies and its concomitant emphasis on overconsumption as the expression of a nation's modernity make the commodity ever more important for its phantasmagoric qualities—its housing of the productive horrors and social utopias, its elegant inversion of the subject-object dialectic, and its inherent transience, echoing the fragility of capitalism itself as a viable mode of production. The neoliberal re-territorializing of national spaces into global districts of production and consumption creates, not merely new efficiencies, but new desires for communitarian affiliations, made stronger because of their slow fade into history.",759964910,,Dissertations & Theses," Nitsch, JudiNitschJudiNitsch, Judi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2172846301 , 53223381 , 66569 , 9781124246789 , 3423639 , 3423639", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124246789, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/759964910?accountid=14496, 0298 Modern literature, 0298 Modern literature, 0298 Modern literature,, 0298 Modern literature, Modern literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Benjamin, Walter , Dreamworlds , Economic development , Globalization , Mass utopia , Postcolonial theory , Third World",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Developing+dreamworlds%3A+The+reimagining+of+mass+utopia+in+spaces+of+over%2Funderdevelopment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nitsch%2C+Judi&amp;isbn=9781124246789&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The coordination of multi-joint reaching movements: A developmental profile,"The study of visually-guided reaching has been a meaningful tool to investigate sensory-motor coordination in typical development and different clinical paediatric populations. The aim of this study was to characterize the development of multi-joint reaching behaviour in children and youth, from 5 to 16 years of age, allowing us to capture changes that may occur into adolescence. Participants were 68 able-bodied children and youth, with no history of developmental, educational or social problems. A stratified recruitment strategy was used to adequately represent five age groups: I (5-6 years), II (7-8 years), III (9-10 years), IV (11-13 years) and V (14-16 years). A center-out reaching task was used as it allowed us to measure effects of limb mechanics during reaching. Different patterns of inter-segmental motions at the shoulder and elbow joints were needed to reach the different targets: flexion at both joints, extension at both joints, and a mixed-coordination pattern. Children were asked to reach quickly and accurately to 8 targets located at 45 degree intervals around the perimeter of a circle with a 6 cm radius. The development of reaching was described using non-parametric statistics. The global features of path length and total movement decreased as a function of increasing age, with less variability observed in older participants (p&lt;0.05). This increased accuracy was explained by a significant reduction (p&lt;0.05) in distance and direction error of the first movement component of the reach, indicative of the increasing ability of children to accurately plan movements based on an internal representation of the limb. These older children were also able to respond to the visual target more quickly (p&lt;0.05). In general, initial direction errors and total movement time increased from a minimum for the 2-joint flexion coordination to a maximum for the mixed-coordination pattern. The magnitude of error, however, decreased as a function of age (p&lt;0.05), and in particular for the mixed-coordination pattern (p&lt;0.01). This center-out task is therefore considered to be responsive to observe effects of development and limb mechanics on performance. The established normative data set will provide a reference for the measures of performance in children with neurodevelopmental disorders.",760947347,,Dissertations & Theses," Choe, Noreen N.ChoeN.NoreenChoe, Noreen N.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2174631901 , 55154841 , 66569 , 9780494650240 , MR65024 , MR65024", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494650240, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/760947347?accountid=14496, 0382 Physical therapy, 0382 Physical therapy, 0382 Physical therapy,, 0382 Physical therapy, Physical therapy, Health and environmental sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+coordination+of+multi-joint+reaching+movements%3A+A+developmental%0Aprofile&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Choe%2C+Noreen+N.&amp;isbn=9780494650240&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Forward movement?

While operating at a far remove from the depressing images of post-War devastation and the propaganda images of the South Korean totalitarian regime, comedy film was both incredibly popular, and can be appreciated as a politically maneuvered genre. I trace the socio-political and industry origins of the production of the comedy film genre, and examine its cultural contexts and effects through the Syngman Rhee regime (1948-1960) to the April Revolution, and into the pre-Yushin Park Chung Hee era (1961-1970). I argue that structural changes in the South Korean film industry, especially its highly gendered and state-orchestrated consolidation, were critical to the image production, film language, and frame and narrative structures of comedy films. On the other hand, the style of comedy film—distinguished by its remarkable generic hybridity and considerable transnational circulation—appealed to the Korean audience. The comedies combine colonial popular performance (e.g., akkŭk, a Japanese-influenced, Korean style vaudeville), the visual techniques and mise-en-scène of Classical Hollywood film, and the star-power of comedians. Transnational and cross-cultural fantasy, I argue that, is disjunctively combined with didactic/state-centered descriptions of family and gender, and thus, comedy films both satisfied and disciplined the industrial, national, and popular needs of immediate post-colonial South Korean society as it struggled to cultivate a modern developed nation.",787906786,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Chung-KangKimChung-KangKim, Chung-Kang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2189310801 , 55554681 , 66569 , 9781124317526 , 3430875 , 3430875", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124317526, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/787906786?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," History , Asian Studies , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Anti-communism , Colonialism , Gender , Korea , Low-brow , Patriarch , U.S. occupation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=South+Korean+golden-age+comedy+film%3A+Industry%2C+genre%2C+and+popular%0Aculture+%281953-1970%29&amp;issn=07370873&amp;date=1987-07-01&amp;volume=6&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=58&amp;au=Ward%2C+Jerry+W%2C+Jr&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Griot%3A+Official+Journal+of+the+Southern+Conference+on+Afro-American+Studies%2C+Inc.&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/1987051455&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The New Negro Flow and the Black Atlantic: The Musical Discourse of the Literary Griots of the Americas,"This dissertation investigates the role of music in twentieth-century literature of the Americas. More precisely, it expands the concept of the New Negro Renaissance in terms of time, place, and language. Previous studies have diminished the geographical and temporal extent of this defining moment, locating it in Harlem, starting in 1919 with the end of WWI and the Great Migration, and ending with the 1930 Great Depression. This project departs from this traditional account, demonstrating that what is usually perceived as a North American phenomenon was, in fact, international from its inception. Paying particular attention to the United States and the Caribbean, it examines what I call ""The New Negro Flow,"" which I see as representing the discussion occurring during the first half of the twentieth century between places in the Americas where there had been a large transplanted Black population. Since it is not fled to one geographical location or nation, the concept of flow does not restrict the movement in terms of time and place. In contrast to established terms such as ""Harlem Renaissance"" or ""New Negro Renaissance,"" the New Negro Flow points to the possibility for a dialogue, rather than a set discourse, where many views diverged on the role of art and on race, while also converging in the importance attributed to music. Indeed, throughout the African Diaspora, writers like the North American W. E. B. Du Bois, the Cuban Nicolas Guillén, and the Martinican Aimé Césaire have used music to retain Africanisms, sustain a sense of belonging, adjust to urban life, provide subversive historical accounts, and encourage uprisings. Upholding the role of the African griot —a musical historian, praise-singer, and warrior—and adapting it to a set of new circumstances, they are what I call ""literary griots."" Merging literature and music— the American spirituals, the French Creole biguine, or the Cuban son —the New Negro Flow was the first large-scale movement to theorize the social power of music for the African Diaspora, marking the first half of the twentieth century as a watershed period for the definition of Black modernity in the Americas.",807621180,,Dissertations & Theses," Gras, DelphineGrasDelphineGras, Delphine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2191533801 , 55611641 , 66569 , 9781124314358 , 3431529 , 3431529", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124314358, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/807621180?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0325 Black studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," Comparative literature , Black studies , Caribbean literature , American literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , African diaspora , Black Atlantic , Francophone , Harlem Renaissance , Latin America , Negrista , Negritude",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+New+Negro+Flow+and+the+Black+Atlantic%3A++The+Musical+Discourse+of+the+Literary+Griots+of+the+Americas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gras%2C+Delphine&amp;isbn=9781124314358&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Untrammeled thinking the promise and peril of the Second Amenia Conference, 1920–1940","Beginning in the 1890s, W.E.B.

These social scientists, professors, social workers, lawyers, doctors, and librarians followed Du Bois's work through the NAACP and its magazine, the Crisis, through persona] correspondence with him, and in individual meetings. Du Bois interested them and they interested him. They were in some ways his intellectual children. He showed this when he invited 32 of them to discuss the future of African American activism with other leaders of the NAACP in 1933 in Amenia, New York at the Second Amenia Conference.

The central narrative of the twentieth century—the Civil Rights Movement—misses this cadre of leaders because their actions fit their time rather than fitting current expectation of civil rights leaders. Their parents and communities focused on education as the primary way to solve racial turmoil—the education of whites about their own country's racism and the education of African Americans to join the professional class, disproving pseudo-scientific theories about the lower intellectual ability of people of African descent and providing a modicum of security in Jim Crow America. The research that these men and women conducted and wrote about established a basis for studying African Americans that continues today. Scholars still use their data sources for contemporary questions. The interwar period had several other nodes of black leadership, including black nationalists, religious leaders, business leaders, and members of the underground market. Acknowledging all these nodes of leadership, whether or not they led to the Civil Rights Movement, emphasizes the era's complexity and the difficult choices facing African Americans born in a world where Jim Crow laws and lynching were ever-present threats. This dissertation considers several specific topics in its attempt to map a piece of the extensive national and international network of the Talented Tenth. They include almost entirely unstudied topics, like black women's organizations in Harlem, black women attending interracial Christian conferences in the United States, Europe, and Asia, black women's role at Fisk University, and participation in the New Deal. Topics covered also include a thorough examination of the community of social scientists at Howard University self-titled the Young Turks. They created a vibrant community of political and economic debate in 1930s Washington DC as important as the cultural renaissance in Harlem the decade before or the literary community in Chicago in the late 1930s and 1940s. The Young Turks also travelled extensively across the United States and internationally. In London, they were part of the community of African expatriates that included several future independence leaders. Societal change arrives in many forms, sometimes through street protests and sometimes through the persistent efforts of social scientists and social workers. This dissertation proves the necessity of considering all forms of change.",815413121,,Dissertations & Theses," Kientz, Lauren L.KientzL.LaurenKientz, Lauren L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2202916291 , 55933761 , 66569 , 9781124333090 , 3435106 , 3435106", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124333090, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/815413121?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," Black history , American history"," Social sciences , Byrd, Mabel , Intellectual history , Internationalism , National Association for the Advancement of Colored People , Race relations , Second Amenia Conference , Young Turks",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Untrammeled+thinking+the+promise+and+peril+of+the+Second+Amenia+Conference%2C+1920%E2%80%931940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kientz%2C+Lauren+L.&amp;isbn=9781124333090&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Conflicting Dialogues: The Survey of Race Relations in the Trans-Pacific and the Fight for Asian American Racial Equality,"This dissertation explores the founding and organization of, and the conclusions derived from the Survey of Race Relations on the Pacific Coast. Organized in 1921 by missionaries recently returned from Japan and funded by East Coast liberal Protestant organizations, the Survey sought to challenge anti-Japanese (and to a lesser degree anti-Chinese) racial discrimination on the Pacific Coast. Between January 1924 and March 1925, liberal Protestant organizers hired sociologists, university professors and students, and missionaries to collect interviews, life histories, and miscellany among white and Asian populations on the Pacific Coast. This study focuses especially on the incentives that drove liberal Protestants to found the Survey and the incentives that drove first-generation Chinese and Japanese immigrants and members of the second generation to participate in the project. For those Asian Americans who participated in the study, the Survey became a forum in which to describe to white Americans the immigration experience and simultaneously challenge racial intolerance. Liberal Protestant organizers used the Survey to bolster their advocacy for trans-Pacific internationalism and launch an international discussion of anti-Asian racial hostility. This dissertation is significant for the way it places the Survey of Race Relations in a trans-Pacific context. It considers social and political factors in the United States and East Asia that shaped both the liberal Protestant movement and first- and second-generation Chinese and Japanese Americans in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Finally, this study draws on the two largest archives of the Survey of Race Relations as well as on archives, biographies, correspondences, and oral interviews not utilized by historians who have written about the Survey in the past. Taken together, these sources lead to new conclusions regarding the history of racial liberalism in the American Protestant church as well as the social and political history of first- and second-generation Chinese and Japanese American in the first decades of the twentieth century.",815736014,,Dissertations & Theses," Griffith, Sarah M.GriffithM.SarahGriffith, Sarah M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2203727371 , 55951211 , 66569 , 9781124330341 , 3427844 , 3427844", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124330341, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/815736014?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0582 Modern history",," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0582 Modern history"," History , American history , Asian American Studies , Modern history"," Social sciences , Asian-American , Comparative race and ethnicity , Liberal Protestantism , Pacific history , Racial equality , Trans-Pacific , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=Camping+the+Dirty+Dozens%3A+The+Queer+Resources+of+Black+Nationalist+Invective&amp;title=Callaloo&amp;issn=01612492&amp;date=2000-01-01&amp;volume=23&amp;issue=1&amp;spage=290&amp;au=Ross%2C+Marlon+B&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Callaloo&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/0000320638&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1353%2Fcal.2000.0060,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Subaltern migrancy and transnational locality: The undocumented African immigrant in international cinema,"Clandestine African migration into the global North has been discussed extensively in the social sciences over the past two decades, but the representations of undocumented immigrant characters in literature and film have not yet received significant critical recognition. This dissertation is a response to the scarcity of scholarship on visual representations of contemporary clandestine migration movements out of West Africa. By analyzing cinematically recreated and visualized secret border crossings and clandestine lives in the Global North, I want to contribute to the current discourse on transit cinema to account for the filmic specificities used in recreating a cinema about a contemporary ""subaltern African diaspora."" My discussion includes films by European and African filmmakers, among them Abderrahmane Sissako, Mohammed Soudani, Stephen Frears, Jean-Pierre and Luc Dardenne, Jean-Marie Téno, Sola Osofisan, and others. This dissertation addresses tropes such as imaginations, waiting, hope, and invisibility that appear consistently in the films. In addition, I define and outline the cinematic subaltern laborscape, based on Arjun Appadurai's definition of global""-scapes,"" through comparing cinematic spaces and conditions in and under which undocumented African workers act and in which they negotiate their relationship with the workplace, fellow clandestine workers, and middlemen who can move between illegal and legal laborscapes. I thereby maintain that The creation of clandestine landscapes within the subaltern labor diaspora remains inextricably linked to the imagination of the migrant and its constant revision. Furthermore, I discuss the cinematic representation, on- and off-screen, of the migrants' countries of origin vis-à-vis the representation of the host nation states in the context of undocumented labor. The portrayal of the host nation state often quite obviously reflects on the filmmakers' background as well as the most prevalent national discourse on clandestine immigration in the film's country of production in that the productions reflect on societal anxieties regarding immigration. While many European filmmakers highlight issues of xenophobia and racism in their films, both in the narrative and aesthetically, transnational African filmmakers tend to focus more on the individual's position within the host culture, especially as s/he relates to other immigrants from her/his home country.",817403129,,Dissertations & Theses," Hoffman, ClaudiaHoffmanClaudiaHoffman, Claudia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2211457901 , 56162881 , 66569 , 9781124356969 , 3436339 , 3436339", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124356969, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/817403129?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0295 Comparative literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0295 Comparative literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0295 Comparative literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0293 African Studies , 0295 Comparative literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0900 Film studies"," African Studies , Comparative literature , Ethnic studies , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Cinema , Clandestine , Europe , Migration , Transnational locality , Undocumented immigrants , West Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Subaltern+migrancy+and+transnational+locality%3A+The+undocumented+African+immigrant+in+international+cinema&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hoffman%2C+Claudia&amp;isbn=9781124356969&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“Yours in liberation”: Lou Sullivan and the construction of FTM identity,"This study is a socio-cultural biography of gay female-to-male (FTM) pioneering activist Lou Sullivan (1951–1991) that brings together the fields of queer history and transgender studies in a trans -historical analysis of the construction of FTM identity. I employ both transgender and queer analytical frameworks, examining the relationship between gender identity and sexual orientation, and the relationship between embodiment and the construction and deployment of identity categories. I analyze Sullivan's FTM identity formation in terms of a dialectic relationship between Sullivan's sense of self and the social forces he encountered, specifically identity-based communities, the medical regime, and his personal relationships. Because of the intersection of his gay sexual identity and FTM gender identity, Sullivan was instrumental in forging an FTM community based upon a shared sense of gender identity that included all sexual orientations, and in changing the medical diagnosis and treatment of transsexualism. This work contributes to existing transgender and queer historical narratives by presenting a social history of gay liberation in Milwaukee, an analysis of the historical overlaps and fissures between gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender identities and communities, an investigation of the impact of HIV/AIDS on San Francisco's transgender community, and a detailed account of the history of the FTM community.

The goal is to capture the economic importance of each one of these two linkages between freer trade on the one hand, and social welfare and sectoral growth on the other. The analyses are conducted within the framework of CGE models and through applications of Harris and Todaro (1970) and Corden and Findlay (1975). Results show that labor migration and capital movement decrease from the agricultural sector to the rest of the economy. Capital immobility has a negative effect on the whole economy: most outputs (except in the public administration sector which uses no capital), factors' incomes, household welfare, saving and international trade fall under the free trade agreements. When capital is the only mobile factor, most of the effects of freer trade are reversed: the only sector that suffers from freer trade is services, most factors' incomes increase excluding those used in irrigated agriculture and rural but non-agricultural areas; as a result most households except the rural poor ones are better off; private and foreign saving increase as well as international trade. When both labor migration and capital formation and mobility are represented, results are mixed, but predominantly resembling those obtained under the labor mobility and capital immobility assumption. The simulations where only one factor is mobile show the importance of the role played by capital accumulation on household welfare, saving, and international trade. It indicates the need for policies that provide stronger incentives to save and support more capital-intensive industries in order to take advantage of freer trade. Policies that encourage labor mobility are also desirable. Sensitivity analyses, conducted under the more realistic assumption that both factors are mobile, solidify some assessments and reveal the ambiguity of others.",822408594,,Dissertations & Theses," Soufi, WidadSoufiWidadSoufi, Widad",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2230030391 , 56902971 , 66569 , 9781124363233 , 3436981 , 3436981", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124363233, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/822408594?accountid=14496," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0601 International Relations"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0601 International Relations"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0601 International Relations",," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0601 International Relations"," Agricultural economics , International Relations , Studies , Labor economics , Trade agreements , Free trade"," Social sciences , Capital flows , Computable general equilibrium , European Union , Labor migration , Morocco , Trade liberalization , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+effects+of+the+free+trade+agreements+with+the+EU+and+U.S.+on+labor+migration+and+capital+accumulation+and+flows+in+Morocco&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Soufi%2C+Widad&amp;isbn=9781124363233&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A plague on both houses?: Population movements and the spread of disease across the Ottoman-Russian Black Sea frontier, 1768-1830s","Based upon a reading of Ottoman, Russian, and Bulgarian archival documents, this dissertation examines the response by the Ottoman and Russian states to the accelerated pace of migration and spread of disease in the Black Sea region from the outbreak of the Russo-Ottoman War of 1768-1774 to the signing of the Treaty of Hünkar Iskelesi in 1833. Building upon introductory chapters on the Russian-Ottoman Black Sea frontier and a case study of Bulgarian population movements between the Russian and Ottoman Empires, this dissertation analyzes Russian and Ottoman migration and settlement policies, the spread of epidemic diseases (plague and cholera) in the Black Sea region, the construction of quarantines and the implementation of travel document regimes. The role and position of the Danubian Principalities of Moldavia and Wallachia as the ""middle ground"" between the Ottoman and Russian Empires in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries is also addressed. The basic argument of this dissertation is that in response to significant increases in human mobility and the concomitant spread of epidemic diseases in the Black Sea region in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, the Ottoman and Russian states - identifying epidemic diseases (plague and cholera) as the primary ""security threats"" to their subject populations - moved to check the spread of disease across the Black Sea region through the imposition of stern anti-disease measures and the creation of new institutions of border and social control (quarantines). Drawing upon world-historical methodology, this dissertation adopts a regional framework to balance the prevailing historiography of Ottoman-Russian antagonism and conflict in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. While not discounting geo-strategic and ideological confrontation between the Ottoman and Russian Empires, this dissertation emphasizes the ""transnational"" character of Ottoman-Russian relations in the Black Sea region in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. On the issues of migration management and disease control, Ottoman and Russian officials - at the imperial, provincial, and local levels - communicated about and coordinated their response to surges in population movements and the mutual threat posed by the spread of epidemic disease across the Ottoman-Russian Black Sea frontier.",823968602,,Dissertations & Theses," Robarts, AndrewRobartsAndrewRobarts, Andrew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2234078881 , 53376321 , 66569 , 9781124383033 , 3433060 , 3433060", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124383033, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/823968602?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0724 Russian history"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0724 Russian history"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0724 Russian history",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0724 Russian history"," Middle Eastern history , Russian history"," Social sciences , Black Sea , Bulgaria , Disease , Migration , Ottoman , Russia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+plague+on+both+houses%3F%3A+Population+movements+and+the+spread%0Aof+disease+across+the+Ottoman-Russian+Black+Sea+frontier%2C+1768-1830s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Robarts%2C+Andrew&amp;isbn=9781124383033&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Hydrocarbon conflict in the Peruvian Amazon: Indigenous peoples' decolonization of development and sustainability,"In 2008 and 2009 the indigenous peoples from the Peruvian Amazon staged massive protests in opposition to President Alan Garcia’s development policies, many of which were designed to facilitate the exploitation and development of natural resources on indigenous territorial spaces. Tragically, the protests ended on June 5 (2009) in the Amazonian province of Bagua, where, according to official reports, ten protesters and twenty-three police officers were killed. Many protesters were injured and others were reported missing. The Bagua event underscores the seriousness of natural resource development on indigenous territorial spaces. This dissertation argues that in order to move toward environmentally sustainable and socially equitable natural resources policies it is necessary to rethink these policies on indigenous territories. To make this case, I examine an environmental conflict over hydrocarbon development on indigenous territories between the Garcia government and the Indigenous Movement in the Peruvian Amazon (IMPA). Situating this conflict in the broader context of the Garcia government’s development policy, the dissertation (1) provides a historical and institutional analysis of Peruvian hydrocarbon development on indigenous territories, (2) uses social movement theory to explain indigenous resistance to hydrocarbon and natural resource development on indigenous territorial spaces, and (3) introduces an alternative theory that explains the differences between indigenous and state development perspectives and challenges many of the current neoliberal/socialist framings of indigenous/state conflicts over natural resources. In the end, I argue that a decolonization of Peru’s natural resource policy regime is necessary to create policies that are ecologically sustainable, socially equitable, and avoid violent confrontations. Decolonization—a complex and formidable challenge—suggests that indigenous peoples gain greater decision-making control over the natural resources located on indigenous territorial spaces. Contrary to the opinion of the Peruvian government and beyond the stipulations set in International Labor Organization Convention 169, this means that indigenous peoples should have the power to prevent unwanted oil development within indigenous territorial spaces. My projects adds to the Political Science literature by introducing an alternative theoretical framework for the analysis of these issues that will encourage scholars, governments, and political commentators to reevaluate issues related to natural resource development on indigenous territories.",839811741,,Dissertations & Theses," Stetson, GeorgeStetsonGeorgeStetson, George",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2238166711 , 54392351 , 66569 , 9781124397405 , 3433728 , 3433728", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124397405, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/839811741?accountid=14496," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0640 Sustainability"," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0640 Sustainability"," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0640 Sustainability",," 0477 Environmental Studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0640 Sustainability"," Environmental Studies , Political science , Ethnic studies , Sustainability"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Amazonia , Hydrocarbons , Indigenous , Peru , Social movements , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hydrocarbon+conflict+in+the+Peruvian+Amazon%3A+Indigenous+peoples%27+decolonization+of+development+and+sustainability&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stetson%2C+George&amp;isbn=9781124397405&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""We are from before, yes, but we are new: Autonomy, territory, and the production of new subjects of self-government in Zapatismo","The 1994 Zapatista uprising in Chiapas, Mexico, created a rupture with a series of neoliberal policies implemented in Mexico and on a global scale over the last few decades of the 20th century. In a moment when alternatives to neoliberal global capitalism appeared to have disappeared from the world stage, the Zapatista Army for National Liberation (EZLN) initiated a movement and process that would have significance not only in Chiapas and for Mexico, but for many struggles and movements around the world that would come to identify with a kind of “alter­globalization” project. This dissertation examines the historical moment of neoliberal globalization, what the EZLN calls the “Fourth World War,” the Zapatista initiative to construct an alternative political project, and the importance of this process of rupture and construction for our understanding of social organization, political participation, struggle and subjectivity. Taking up theories of new forms of domination as dispersed forms of power operating through non-state institutions and a kind of participative subject in the public realm (following Raúl Zibechi and Stefano Harney), I argue that lines of antagonism can no longer be drawn between public and private, or state and non-state realms, but must be viewed as different strategies of subjectification, one as the subject-making of a form of governance, still but more subtly a form of domination, and one as a form of struggle for collective self­making. While both forms employ mechanisms and imaginaries of cooperation, the former cultivates subjective compatibility with an existing system while the latter I associate with the Zapatista concept and practice of autonomy. Drawing on several years of fieldwork in Chiapas as well as the extensive theoretical work of the Zapatistas themselves, I trace the development of Zapatista autonomy as a concept and exercise of power and in its implementation as a system of self-government and provision of services through the construction of autonomous territory. This use and understanding of power has been both encouraged by and enabling of the autonomous judicial, health, education, communication and production systems in Zapatista territory. My argument here is that, beyond control over land, services, and the mode of production, territorial and political autonomy has permitted the Zapatistas to create an entire system of “new” social relations, an ecology of practices that create a mutually constructive relationship between (autonomous) system and (self-determined) subject in a cycle that continually widens and deepens the scope of what is possible for both. I then turn to an investigation of the Zapatista initiative to create a larger political project, and a more extensive and diverse collective subject of struggle, through the launching of the “Other Campaign” as a non-electoral anti­capitalist movement. If governance as a new form of domination performs the function of interpellating individuals into, using Stefano Harney’s terms, a “class with interest” identifiable by its stakes in the system, I understand the Other Campaign to be a project to gather those “without interest,” often considered expendable or dangerous to the system or “society” in general, into a “class beyond interest,” a self­determined community engaged in a struggle not for a moment of liberation to be won but as the construction of emancipation as a way of life.",845244544,,Dissertations & Theses," Kaufman, Mara CatherineKaufmanCatherineMaraKaufman, Mara Catherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2242530561 , 51880341 , 66569 , 9781124401669 , 3433944 , 3433944", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124401669, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/845244544?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Autonomy , Globalization , Governance , Mexico , Territory , Zapatismo",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=We+are+from+before%2C+yes%2C+but+we+are+new%3A++Autonomy%2C+territory%2C+and+the+production+of+new+subjects+of+self-government+in+Zapatismo&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kaufman%2C+Mara+Catherine&amp;isbn=9781124401669&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A spatial analysis of human trafficking in Greater Los Angeles,"This research provides a spatial analysis of the local anti-human trafficking movement that has emerged in Greater Los Angeles since the discovery of the El Monte case in 1995. Over the past 15 years, the U.S. government has allocated substantial funds and resources to fighting human trafficking in Greater Los Angeles and elsewhere in the country. Non-governmental and governmental institutions have launched a series of awareness campaigns, established coalitions of agencies, developed and implemented rescue strategies and social service programs, and educated tens of thousands of law enforcement members and local communities on the issue of human trafficking. So far, these federally led anti-human trafficking efforts have struggled to yield their expected outcome in terms of the number of victims identified and traffickers prosecuted. Deploying a variety of ethnographic and qualitative methods, this study investigates how and in what form a localization of international and national anti-human trafficking responses through local agents has emerged as an essential but often neglected factor in effectively combating human trafficking in Greater Los Angeles. The study identifies key agents operating in the anti-human trafficking sector and analyzes the forms in which local agents create space for meaningfully and effectively translating national anti-trafficking policies into specific local contexts. Results show that community-based organizations embracing the dynamics of place and adopting a strong victim-centered approach have produced better outcomes in terms of identifying victims, organizing adequate and necessary assistance, and seeking justice for survivors of human trafficking.",847232182,,Dissertations & Theses," Holzer, Jacqueline W.HolzerW.JacquelineHolzer, Jacqueline W.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2248181971 , 52762781 , 66569 , 9781124412870 , 3434440 , 3434440", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124412870, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/847232182?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0627 Criminology"," 0366 Geography , 0627 Criminology"," 0366 Geography , 0627 Criminology",," 0366 Geography , 0627 Criminology"," Geography , Criminology"," Social sciences , California , Geography , Human rights , Human trafficking , Local agents , Los Angeles",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+spatial+analysis+of+human+trafficking+in+Greater+Los+Angeles&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Holzer%2C+Jacqueline+W.&amp;isbn=9781124412870&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""From Tejano to Latino in Indiana: The evolving class and ethnic identity of Mexican migrants to the Great Lakes, 1900-2000","For ethnic Mexican migrants traveling from Texas to Indiana during the 1920s and 1930s, material inequalities left an indelible stamp on every aspect of their lives. Culturally, economically, and racially, they differed sharply from the urban communities dotting the Indiana landscape, such as the city of Muncie, where sociologists Robert S. Lynd and Helen Merrell Lynd researched a two-part study published as ""Middletown: A Study in Modern American Culture"" (1929), and ""Middletown in Transition: A Study in Cultural Conflicts"" (1937). In his book ""The Analogical Imagination"" (1980), theologian and philosopher David Tracy has examined how key cultural experiences span time and place, resisting precise definition, yet drawing observers into their embrace. In an effort to capture the essence of these experiences, individuals, societies, and cultures expand their observational horizons by engaging in an on-going dialectic between descriptive analogy and negation. The result, which Tracy labeled the ""analogical imagination,"" has the potential to create authentic pluralism. In an effort to define their relationship to middle-class Anglo society, Mexican migrants who settled permanently in Indiana relied on the analogical imagination to negotiate the boundaries of their class, racial, and cultural identities. The result was cultural and social pluralism that emerged over a fifty-year period after World War II, where former migrants formed organizations and interacted with local, state, and federal entities along lines marking the emergence of a diverse middle-class Latino identity. By the end of the 1970s and into the twenty-first century, many ethnic Mexicans in Indiana had a wider sense of ""belonging,"" of being confident that their ethnic dissimilarity from mainstream society was not an occasion for shame and a chance for assimilation, but rather a cause for cultural pride as well as the contribution of pluralism. Those individuals who by the end of the twentieth century considered themselves something other than purely ""Mexican"" or ""Mexican American"" (with ""Latino"" usually serving as the preferred term) were re-categorizing themselves as part of an international community. They retained strong ties to local, cultural, and national origins, often relying on their knowledge of these categories to guide their advocacy work on behalf of migrant workers and recent Latino immigrants. But ethnic Mexicans in Indiana also retained ties to a ""higher,"" more expansive community superseding ethnic or national origins. By aspiring to belong to the ""middle class,"" they aspired to belong to a community spanning the length and breadth of the United States, and perhaps even the entire globe. They viewed other members of middle class society in the same manner that residents of a Midwestern barrio or colonia might have gazed out of their windows at a neighboring community, paying attention to changes in their material and cultural orientation. The history of the Mexican American Social Club, AMOS, the Indianapolis Hispanic Center, and Saint Mary's Church demonstrates that their members took crucial cues from aspects of working- and middle-class society, such as the Chicano movement, service in the Armed Forces, or Vatican II, to form their own composite identity in twentieth-century Indiana. The result was a more plural and increasingly global society. I have examined Indiana oral histories, state archives, church records, and published organizational literature to learn how former migrants articulated their changing perception of themselves and their relation to middle-class American society.",848920581,,Dissertations & Theses," Moralez, EduardoMoralezEduardoMoralez, Eduardo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2256594081 , 52764831 , 66569 , 9781124432847 , 3438882 , 3438882", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124432847, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/848920581?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," American history , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Ethnic Mexicans , Indiana , Latinos , Middle class , Migrants , Tejanos",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+Tejano+to+Latino+in+Indiana%3A+The+evolving+class+and+ethnic+identity+of+Mexican+migrants+to+the+Great+Lakes%2C+1900-2000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moralez%2C+Eduardo&amp;isbn=9781124432847&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Flow and Pause: Exploring human movement within a transit interchange,"Due to the increase of global flows, people, products and information are moving faster than ever before.

From the 1870s through the 1930s, the plaza area was home to Mexicans, Chinese and others who played varying roles in the formation of community. Places that came to be known as ""Chinatown"" and ""Sonoratown"" became not only sites of racial difference but also locations that were designated ""foreign"" districts; thus, they were located ideologically outside of the geopolitical borders of the U.S. nation-state despite their location within U.S. territory. I argue that the U.S. conquest of former Mexican territories, deportation campaigns, Mexican repatriation, and Chinese exclusion were simultaneous processes of border formation that affected the social relationships of Los Angeles residents. In the making of what I call the ""urban borderlands,"" multiracial social and spatial configurations of plaza area neighborhoods were shaped not only by the racialization of places known as ""Chinatown"" and ""Sonoratown"" but also by the shifting locations and meanings of U.S. nation-state borders, including at times immigration exclusion. Linking race, class, gender and nation, this study offers an understanding of community formation in the context of rapid industrialization and modernization. Plaza area residents made meaning of their local geography through conflicts over space, limited resources, exclusion and deportation movements, and industrialization. Through spatial and material culture analyses of public spaces, home spaces, and city geography, this thesis shows how architecture and street spaces might be used to understand the social relationships of Mexican and Chinese residents. In doing so, it examines the different and sometimes opposing spatial imaginaries of Mexican and Chinese residents, reformers, city officials, and city boosters. By examining both pivotal events in which Chinese and Mexican bodies were removed from urban space, and the everyday lives of these residents, this study contributes to a new understanding of not only working-class, immigrant and urban U.S. history, but also Chicana/o and Asian American Studies. In doing so, it illuminates how U.S. global imperialism took on local manifestations in places such as Los Angeles.",849540852,,Dissertations & Theses," Quintana, Isabella Seong-LeongQuintanaSeong-LeongIsabellaQuintana, Isabella Seong-Leong",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2259724751 , 52123801 , 66569 , 9781124439631 , 3441305 , 3441305", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124439631, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/849540852?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," American studies , American history , Asian American Studies , Ethnic studies , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Borderlands , California , Chinese , Gender , Los Angeles , Mexican , Race , Space , Urban",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=National+Borders%2C+Neighborhood+Boundaries%3A+Gender%2C+Space+and+Border+Formation+in+Chinese+and+Mexican+Los+Angeles%2C+1871%E2%80%931938&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Quintana%2C+Isabella+Seong-Leong&amp;isbn=9781124439631&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Imagining the Tupamaros: Resistance and gender in Uruguayan and U.S. revolutionary movements, 1960s–1980s","Using sources located in archives and special collections in Argentina, Uruguay and the United States, this dissertation challenges long held assumptions about the Uruguayan Tupamaros. I employ the methodologies of social and cultural history and feminist scholarship to examine the relationship between state repression and revolutionary resistance, the transnational connections between the Uruguayan Tupamaros and leftist groups in the US as well as issues of gender and sexuality within radical movements. I argue that the Tupamaros engaged in an active discussion with US-based revolutionaries. Focusing on the perspective of Latin Americans during the Cold War, this dissertation examines what the Uruguayan left thought about US politics and culture. I uncover that the Uruguayan left saw the US as two Americas. They criticized the US government but allied with many of its people. This occurred both in the imagination of Uruguayans and in real life connections forged between leftists. While scholars have primarily explored Cuba’s influence on the North American left, I focus on the ways in which the Uruguayan left (particularly the Tupamaros) shaped the activism of US leftists. This study also adds to the discussion of gender and sexuality in Latin America as I investigate whether or not gender reorganization represented a true political goal of the Tupamaros or if their inclusion of women primarily constituted revolutionary rhetoric. While most of the Uruguayan left focused on motherhood as inspiring women’s politics, the Tupamaros disdained traditional constructions of femininity for female combatants. Therefore, although at times problematic, the Tupamaros offered women a new avenue for political participation.",849734451,,Dissertations & Theses," Churchill, Lindsey BlakeChurchillBlakeLindseyChurchill, Lindsey Blake",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2260691671 , 58057171 , 66569 , 9781124456966 , 3442110 , 3442110", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124456966, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/849734451?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations , 0733 Gender studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations , 0733 Gender studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations , 0733 Gender studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations , 0733 Gender studies"," Latin American history , International Relations , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Feminism , Gender , Left , Revolution , Tupamaros , United States , Uruguay",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Imagining+the+Tupamaros%3A+Resistance+and+gender+in+Uruguayan+and+U.S.+revolutionary+movements%2C+1960s%E2%80%931980s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Churchill%2C+Lindsey+Blake&amp;isbn=9781124456966&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Essays on China's Macro-economy and Credit Market,"In the past two decades, the world has witnessed an unprecedented growth of GDP in China. And the growth has largely been driven by the surging current surplus, which results in large international reserves accumulation. The effect of this gigantic build up of reserves has been a source of growing public attention in the context of the debate on global imbalances. A common argument is that the culprit of global imbalances is a result of exchange rate manipulation by the Chinese authorities, which peg the RMB to the dollar at a low value. Chapter one looks at the real exchange rate movement in China and in other foreign currency inflow countries during the period with massive international reserves accumulation. In this chapter, we introduce the idea of ""sterilization by the people"", which refers to the concept of increasing money demand partially offsetting the effect of increasing money supply. And we find that ""sterilization by the people"" plays a dominant role in mitigating the real exchange rate appreciation pressure in China. This finding is consistent with the high savings rate, largely in the form of M2 in China. Further development of the financial system and improvement of the social safety net may reduce people's demand for the monetary balance and lead to the real exchange rate appreciation to a new equilibrium. Chapter two analyzes China's business cycle by linking its credit market with the real economy. To be more specific, it studies the role of credit market imperfection and sectoral asymmetry as means through which shocks to the real economy are propagated and amplified. Most Chinese firms finance their investment by internal funds, which explain the high and ever-growing corporate savings in the recent decade. This is due to the lack of access to the external funds, in other words, credit constraints. With its credit constraint more binding, the non-tradable sector experiences larger fluctuation in investment and output than the tradable sector. Hence, we observe the non-uniform credit market imperfection and unbalanced business fluctuation across sectors. Both chapter one and two are centered on the macroeconomic consequences of the high savings rate in China. Chapter three analyzes its potential drivers. It is found that the high savings rate is mainly contributed to the high corporate savings that result from the growing enterprise profits and low dividend payout. And the credit market imperfection is mainly responsible for firms' dependence on internal financing, particularly for the small private firms.",850902248,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhang, YuanyanZhangYuanyanZhang, Yuanyan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2262838451 , 56902961 , 66569 , 9781124450384 , 3441497 , 3441497", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124450384, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/850902248?accountid=14496, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics, 0501 Economics,, 0501 Economics," Economics , Studies , Macroeconomics"," Social sciences , Bayesian estimation , China , Credit market , Sectoral asymmetry",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Essays+on+China%27s+Macro-economy+and+Credit+Market&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Yuanyan&amp;isbn=9781124450384&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Performing the City: An Ethnography of Popular Dance in Kinshasa, DRC","Kinshasa's dance music, bands comprising male musicians and female dancers, is a local creation with roots in Congolese Rumba. During its rapid urbanization, with concerts held daily throughout the city, Kinshasa's popular culture has been vital to the city's international musical reputation and cosmopolitan identity. Although the social relevance of the popular musicians has been studied (White, 2009), how female dancers inform or are informed by contemporary perspectives on gender relations, marginality, modernity and socio-economic realities, has yet to be explored. This thesis illustrates the finding and analysis following three months of observing, interviewing female dancers and performing with a popular Kinshasa musical act. The gaze directed at concert dancers is a recent phenomenon as ""traditional"" performance was more participatory. Through this gaze at dancers who occupy the lowest position within the band and perform sexually suggestive lyrics and dance gestures, the familiar accepted binaries of public and private, ""traditional"" and ""modern"", sacred and profane, appropriate and inappropriate, sensual and sexual are called into question. When concert dancers incorporate ""modern"" references into their choreographies, they build on ""traditional"" dance movement. Paradoxically, although female dancers set aesthetic trends seen even in church settings, they are stigmatized on a moral level for assuming ""vulgar"" roles. It is precisely this marginality that dancers in their concerts, perform and re-affirm.",857087445,,Dissertations & Theses," Braun, Lesley N.BraunN.LesleyBraun, Lesley N.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2292850091 , 59244501 , 66569 , 9780494709979 , MR70997 , MR70997", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494709979, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/857087445?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," Cultural anthropology , Dance"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Congo (Democratic Republic)",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Performing+the+City%3A+An+Ethnography+of+Popular+Dance+in+Kinshasa%2C+DRC&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Braun%2C+Lesley+N.&amp;isbn=9780494709979&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Giving voice to language: Basque language activism and the politics of education reform in France, 1969–1994","Over the past several decades there has been a wellspring of political debate in Europe regarding the rights of linguistic minorities in education. Perhaps nowhere has this transnational debate sparked more controversy than in France where the notion of linguistic rights has been negatively construed by many political authorities as antithetical to the republican model of universal public education. Despite such enmity a host of ethnolinguistic activists in France have been laboring for decades to transform education from a site of exclusion into a vehicle of empowerment. In this dissertation I explore the mobilization dynamics that characterized a minority language schooling initiative within the French Basque Country from 1969 to 1994. Drawing on qualitative case study data, I pay particular attention to the struggles, strategies and successes of Basque language activists affiliated with a community-based schooling association known as ‘Seaska’. Building on social movement theory, I argue that Seaska gradually accrued the support of reluctant policy-makers by mobilizing an influential repertoire of discursive, organizational and performative strategies. Throughout my discussion I show how these strategic practices allowed Seaska to cope with an enduring tide of political opposition, seize upon several windows of political opportunity and gain increasing levels of recognition within the political arena.

A three dimensional investigation of Turkish-Iranian security rapprochement,"This study investigates the underlying reasons for Turkish-Iranian security rapprochement during the Erdogan Administration, and attempts to discover whether the ongoing rapprochement indicates Turkey’s realignment in the international system. It employs a rigorous qualitative analysis to explore the perceptions of the key decision makers throughout the intergovernmental partnership process with Iran on three major security policies: counterterrorism, nuclear proliferation and energy security. It counterposes the threat perceptions and major arguments of the pro-status quo and revisionist elites. The data has been collected through extensive elite/expert interviews and content analysis of the Turkish and international media. Findings of this research indicate that the Turkish and Iranian governments cooperate in counterterrorism policy because both are mainly concerned with the spillover effect of micronationalist independence movements in the post Iraq War security landscape. The Erdogan Administration supports the Iranian nuclear initiative mainly because the key political actors believe that Iran is not developing nuclear weapons and Iranian nuclear program poses no significant threat to Turkey’s national security. In addition the Erdogan Administration forged an energy partnership with Iran not only to meet increasing domestic energy demands but also to promote Turkey’s strategic interests through development of trans-regional pipeline networks. The investigations revealed that Turkey’s growing security partnership with Iran does not indicate realignment from the West to the Muslim world. Turkey’s rapprochement with Iran is driven by practical and rational calculations rather than Islamic identity or aspirations. Even though many key actors in the Justice and Development Party government comes from religious social networks, their statements indicate that the Erdogan Administration does not seek to align itself with the Muslim World at the expense of the existing pro-Western orientation. Instead, Turkey’s rapprochement with Iran is an integral part of the Strategic Depth doctrine of Foreign Minister Davutoglu to expand Turkey’s interrelations with the East in line with national interests. In so doing, the Erdogan Administration not only addresses the practical security interests but it also attempts to regain the strategic superiority in the Near East.",858078935,,Dissertations & Theses," Ekici, BehsatEkiciBehsatEkici, Behsat",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2298939631 , 53964801 , 66569 , 9781124519296 , 3447310 , 3447310", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124519296, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/858078935?accountid=14496," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy",," 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," Middle Eastern Studies , International Relations , Political science , Public policy"," Social sciences , Iran , Realignment , Security rapprochement , Turkey",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Is+Turkey+realigning%3F+A+three+dimensional+investigation+of+Turkish-Iranian+security+rapprochement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ekici%2C+Behsat&amp;isbn=9781124519296&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“You never hear about the wheelchair”: Violence and mobility in a Westside Chicago gang,"Of all major U.S. cities, Chicago currently has the highest homicide rate. During the 2008-2009 academic year, a record number of public school students–38–were murdered. Over a single weekend in April 2009, 36 people were gunned down. Given this context, how do we attempt to understand the lives of those made culpable for most of the violence--young gang members--and the impoverished neighborhoods in which they live? The most recent literature on gangs and urban life has rightly shifted away from the racist presumptions that inner city blacks are predisposed to violent crime. Rather than an index of innate dysfunction, groundbreaking sociological work has argued that deviance is produced through and by social exclusion. The notion that violence flourishes in communities that have been regarded as ""socially isolated"" underscores recent work, which shows that gangs fill bureaucratic voids in areas that have been neglected or abandoned by the government. The most compelling of this work has delineated the affects of postindustrial out-migration, economic stagnation, and drug-related crime to address the causes of inner city poverty. Researchers like Sudhir Venkatesh have been persuasive in accounting for the socio-historical parameters of black impoverishment in cities like Chicago. Still, emergent new factors exist. The reinvestment in urban spaces through gentrification, the transnational networks of drug distribution, not to mention consumer products like rap music and shoe advertising, which traffic markers of the inner-city, beg questions about the extent to which the ""ghetto"" is still isolated. How might we complicate discourses of transnationalism, migration, and diaspora that rely on a sense of mobility, but often overlook the way these processes are structured by populations that have been regarded as stagnant or ""socially isolated""? How do we conceptualize the collective and individual aspirations that move gang members? What is it like for the latest generation of a 50-year-old gang to inhabit a post-social movement moment? My dissertation illuminates the external forces that connect the inner-city to disparate social worlds through the thematic trope of ""mobility."" Mobility, in its various guises–and its inverses–includes many of the forms of social practice that I describe throughout the dissertation. These practices range from a local Chicago dance called, ""footworkin'"", to marches on city hall, to meetings at local churches, to the travels of paralyzed, ex-gang members who host community forums on violence. The westside Chicago neighborhood that I call, ""Eastwood"" is one in which gang members are constantly on the move: hustling, dancing, trading, taking up corners, fighting–until death or paralysis–sometimes physical, sometimes social, strikes. What is more, it is mobility here that organizes space and its control, whether we are referring to the geographies of commerce in which gang members circulate or the plans for ""redevelopment"" they seek to combat. Throughout this study, forms of intersubjective experience and everyday practice, which if viewed alone would seem to evidence social disorder, dysfunction, or pathology, become interconnected through a notion of mobility–one that illuminates the ways in which Eastwood residents presently engage with the past while imagining a more peaceful future.",858154801,,Dissertations & Theses," Ralph, LaurenceRalphLaurenceRalph, Laurence",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2299617531 , 51510381 , 66569 , 9781124514796 , 3444255 , 3444255", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124514796, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/858154801?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0627 Criminology"," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0627 Criminology"," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0627 Criminology",," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0627 Criminology"," African American Studies , Black studies , Cultural anthropology , Criminology"," Social sciences , Chicago , Disability , Gang , Gang violence , Historical consciousness , Illinois , Mobility",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CYou+never+hear+about+the+wheelchair%E2%80%9D%3A+Violence+and+mobility+in+a+Westside+Chicago+gang&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ralph%2C+Laurence&amp;isbn=9781124514796&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Carbon capital: The political ecology of carbon forestry and development in Chiapas, Mexico","This dissertation explores contradictions of development within market-based carbon forestry projects that aim to reduce global greenhouse gas emissions associated with climate change. Through the mechanism of the carbon market, forestry-based offset projects are in theory intended to reduce carbon emissions in a cost-effective manner, while also generating development and livelihood co-benefits for communities that participate by growing carbon-sequestering trees. However, I have found that in the multiple dimensions of sustainable development—the economic, social, and ecological—carbon forestry has largely failed to generate sustainable development benefits. This finding largely corresponds with previous empirical studies exploring questions of development through the carbon market. This dissertation, however, takes a different approach, in an attempt to understand not only project impacts but how and why market-based efforts at sustainable development have attracted participants despite failing to meet stated social and environmental goals. Through an engagement with debates on sustainable development, neoliberalization of nature, and agrarian change in Mexico, I draw on a relational approach and political ecology analytical framework. This framework gives attention to the social relations of carbon forestry development in Chiapas, in historical and geographical perspective. And the approach allows for an analysis that goes beyond mere recognition of the failure of development through carbon markets; it also demonstrates the ways in which project contradictions are produced and integrated with earlier and ongoing processes of development and agrarian transformation. I argue that this historical perspective, combined with an understanding of the interconnected relations of power stretching from local rural communities through national and global arenas of policy making and governance, can help better guide political strategies aimed at more just and plausible alternatives for social and ecological change. Specifically, I examine the Scolel Té carbon forestry project in Chiapas, Mexico, a region with a long history of conflicts over land and resources. I explore the local history of these resource politics to elucidate the conditions that led to the emergence and adoption of the project in the land-conflicted rainforest region of the Lacandon Jungle. I show that, for farmers involved with Scolel Té, carbon forestry emerged as a strategy to maintain land security in the wake of neoliberal agrarian reform policies that in various ways threaten to displace small landholders. In the Mayan Chol community of Frontera Corozal, however, where I carried out ethnographic fieldwork, the project has largely failed to meet the needs of participating campesinos, and in some cases, it has exacerbated tensions within households and the community. Furthermore, based on a carbon analysis of project plots, the ecological benefits of the project as conducted in the Lacandon Jungle are also substantially lacking. While carbon producers participate in the project in part as a means to secure land tenure, carbon forestry has intersected with a national land privatization process that may make peasant access and control over land tenuous in the future. I argue that this articulation of carbon forestry and land privatization constitutes an instance of what David Harvey calls accumulation by dispossession , whereby capital continues to expand through carbon trading and other markets at the expense of poor farmers’ access to land. Working through these issues substantively, this dissertation links carbon forestry not to the more recent phenomenon of the neoliberalization of nature, but to the ongoing movement of capital into agrarian spaces, demonstrating the continued salience of agrarian questions concerning the fate of the peasantry. In conclusion, I offer alternative, more effective, and more equitable strategies for development and climate change mitigation.",858379678,,Dissertations & Theses," Osborne, Tracey MuttooOsborneMuttooTraceyOsborne, Tracey Muttoo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2301137611 , 59529751 , 66569 , 9781124520889 , 3444378 , 3444378", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124520889, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/858379678?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0366 Geography , 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies",," 0366 Geography , 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies"," Geography , Climate Change , Environmental Studies"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Earth sciences , Carbon forestry , Carbon market , Climate change mitigation , Commodification of nature , Mexico , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Carbon+capital%3A+The+political+ecology+of+carbon+forestry+and+development+in+Chiapas%2C+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Osborne%2C+Tracey+Muttoo&amp;isbn=9781124520889&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Appearance of All, the Reality of Nothing Politics and Gender in the Dominican Republic, 1880-1961","This dissertation examines the feminist movement in the Dominican Republic and particularly its most visible organization, the Acción Feminista Dominicana, during the dictatorship of General Rafael L. Trujillo from 1930 to 1961. The purpose of this research is to reinterpret the role of women as political actors during the Trujillo regime. The Dominican feminists collaborated with the dictatorship as providers of social assistance, as creators and transmitters of propaganda, and as intermediaries for the state in the mobilization of other women. They established and maintained cross-class alliances and international networks that fed into the regime's needs. This role as power- brokers – albeit limited due to the authoritarian nature of the government and their own weakness as a group – cemented middle class women's loyalty to Trujillo because it gave them an entry into the official patronage systems vital to Dominican society at the time. The Dominican case points to a connection between the support of middle class women and the survival of authoritarian governments, highlighting the importance of class over gender or other considerations in these women's political choices.",859483788,,Dissertations & Theses," Zeller, Neici M.ZellerM.NeiciZeller, Neici M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2307787011 , 59809931 , 66569 , 9781124499772 , 3446070 , 3446070", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9781124499772, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/859483788?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0453 Womens studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," Latin American history , Caribbean Studies , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Dictatorship , Dominican Republic , Feminism , Gender , Trujillo Molina, Rafael Leonidas , Women's history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Appearance+of+All%2C+the+Reality+of+Nothing+Politics+and+Gender+in+the+Dominican+Republic%2C+1880-1961&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zeller%2C+Neici+M.&amp;isbn=9781124499772&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Three essays on environmental economics: Remanufacturing, Movements of Waste, and Democracy","Chapter 1: Remanufacturing: Remanufacturing is a form of recycling where used durable goods are refurbished to a condition comparable to new products. With reduced energy and resource consumption, remanufactured goods are produced at a fraction of the original cost and with lower emissions of pollution. This paper presents a theoretical model of remanufacturing where a duopoly of original manufacturers produces a component of a final good. The component needing to be replaced creates an aftermarket. An environmental regulation assessing a minimum level of remanufacturability is also introduced The main results indicate that a social planner could use collusion of the firms on the level of remanufacturability as a substitute for environmental regulation. However, if an environmental regulation is to be implemented, collusion should be repressed since competition supports the public intervention better. One of the results also coincides with the Porter Hypothesis. Chapter 2: Transboundary movements of waste: In a stylized model of international trade, a monopolist in the North exports second-hand products to a representative firm in the South to be reused as intermediate goods, with potential trade gains. The degree of reusability of waste products is a crucial choice variable in the North. This is because with a lack of international vigilance, non-reusable waste can be mixed illegally with the reusable waste. I explore the driving forces for the movement of illegal waste, paying particular attention to the role of local waste regulations, such as the EU's Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment directive. Under mild conditions, it is shown that increased regulation stringency in the North leads its firm to reduce the degree of reusability of its products. As a result, the flow of non-reusable waste to the South increases, providing another channel for the Pollution Haven Hypothesis. Chapter3: Is Democracy good for the environment? The role of private mitigation efforts: We study the question posed in the title in the context of open economies where trade and welfare depend on the extent to which regulation permits the environment to be used as an input in production, and where individuals may privately mitigate the consequences of pollution at a cost. Governments may also manage the openness of the economy to trade directly as well as indirectly via environmental regulation. In this framework, we compare the degree of regulatory stringency and the level of pollution that emerge in the equilibria of a set of political regimes that range from autocratic to fully competitive or democratic. The answer to the question is not straightforward in this investigation because many well-off-citizens in democratic countries may prefer the higher gross incomes that come with freer trade and unregulated production.",870514393,,Dissertations & Theses," Bernard, SophieBernardSophieBernard, Sophie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2368427481 , 54906611 , 66569 , 9780494739099 , NR73909 , NR73909", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010, 9780494739099, English, English,,2010,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/870514393?accountid=14496," 0438 Environmental economics , 0501 Economics"," 0438 Environmental economics , 0501 Economics"," 0438 Environmental economics , 0501 Economics",," 0438 Environmental economics , 0501 Economics"," Environmental economics , Economics , Studies , Remanufacturing"," Social sciences , Democracy , Environmental economics , Illegal waste , Remanufacturing , Waste movement",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Three+essays+on+environmental+economics%3A+Remanufacturing%2C+Movements+of+Waste%2C+and+Democracy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bernard%2C+Sophie&amp;isbn=9780494739099&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Globalization, Localization and the Social Economy The Role of Co-operatives in Taming Globalization","Co-operatives are not often the subject of contemporary attention. The goods, services and overall impact of co-operatives are often overshadowed by the global reach of large private sector enterprise; yet they offer a local alternative as rooted, socially embedded organizations that adhere to democratic principles, coordinate action and build capacity. This thesis will examine the role of co-operatives in the era of globalization and the impact that they have had on modern society. While globalization continues to grow with respect to all aspects of life, the distinction between what David Held refers to as globalizers and anti-globalizers is becoming less distinct; the political focus continues to shift toward a more shared ground of alternative forms of globalization. 1 This shift provides increased awareness of, and possibilities for, co-operative enterprise as an alternative to traditional capitalism. To understand this evolution, this thesis is divided into three main chapters: globalization, the social economy and the role of co-operatives. The role of co-operatives is significant in light of the movement toward a more shared ground of alternative forms of enterprise that respond to globalization. While co-operatives play a significant role in the social economy, globalism continues to challenge co-operatives' distinction and forces a reevaluation of what makes a co-operative unique and desirable to consumers. By definition, a co-operative is an organization that has the goal of improving the economic and social environment of its members by means of an enterprise based on a common need... an autonomous association of people united to meet their common economic and social needs through a jointly-owned and democratically-controlled enterprise. 2 While this thesis sets out to explore alternatives that might assist in taming globalization, this is no easy task for any business model, particularly co-operatives. Yes, co-operatives' local nature allows for an increased ability to build capacity at the local level, yet co-operatives continue to feel the influence of the global marketplace. Technology also plays a critical role in this evolution. This thesis attempts to examine the impacts of globalization and further build on the theory of David Held who claims that the political focus has shifted toward a more shared ground of alternative forms of globalization. To build a case for something alternative, emphasis will be placed on the increased role and place of the social economy. In particular, the role of the co-operative as an enterprise that is positioned to provide a more humanistic alternative to globalization and offer a more balanced approach between the global marketplace and local people. 1 Held, David and McGrew, A.

My thesis examines how participants make sense of different situations of participation along their trajectory in the scene, and analyses the role played by a variety of communicative practices acting as â��means of guidanceâ�� or â��sources of orientationâ�� inside the scene.Â  It advances a performative understanding of cultural process, by focusing on the changing relationship between spatio-temporal coordination and communication, in a phase marked by the penetration of the Internet and mobile phones. The empirical analysis concentrates on the case of the autonomous scenes in Italy, Germany and the UK, and on a series of global protest events attended by autonomous activists in recent years.Â  With the use of participant observation, interviews and textual analysis I reconstruct how participants maintain a sense of place and a sense of direction in collective action and the specificity of different forms of communication that aid orientation. I develop an understanding of the experience of â��autonomous activismâ�� as marked by a striving for orientation in which activists are constantly on the brink of getting lost, because of the lack of a strong â��guidanceâ�� as in the case of authoritarian movements. The autonomous scene comes to be framed as a navigational space in which many trajectories are possible, and it is down to participants to make sense of their own â��itineraryâ��.Â  The thesis concludes that the autonomous scene displays forms of togetherness which recall the ephemerality of other antagonistic or subcultural groupings, yet testify to the problems encountered by social movements in the face of a liquid and individualised society.",899776742,,Dissertations & Theses," Gerbaudo, PaulGerbaudoPaulGerbaudo, Paul",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2491425261 , 65087211 , 101309 , U518382 , U518382 , http://research.gold.ac.uk/6456/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2010,, English, English,,2010,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2010,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899776742?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0700 Social structure, Social structure," http://research.gold.ac.uk/6456/ , 517897 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Navigating+the+rebel+archipelago%3A+orientation%2C+space+and+communication+in+the+%27autonomous+scene%27&amp;issn=&amp;date=2010-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gerbaudo%2C+Paul&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Gendered waters: The participation of women on the program ‘One Million Cisterns’ in the Brazilian semi-arid region,"Women, especially in developing countries, are often responsible for managing water at the household level, which is considered part of their reproductive work. However, they are rarely represented in bodies that decide on water management, and they hardly play a role in the implementation of projects to increase water access. While the need for enhanced gender equality in water management is recognized in the international development discourse, the complexities of gender equality and the need for transformational, ‘deep’ change are poorly understood, and even much less translated into progressive practice on the ground. This dissertation presents a qualitative case study of women participation in the Program ‘One Million Cisterns’ in the Brazilian Semi-Arid region, in three locations: Afogados da Ingazeira, Mossoro and Fortaleza, using participant observations, document analysis and semi-structured interviews with key participants. It illustrates the promises and the challenges of bringing about ‘deep’ gender equality and women’s empowerment in water development. The case study shows that women not only derived significant material benefits from the program (access to water, more time, better health); they also acquired economic and political opportunities, as cistern builders and as members of municipal water commissions—roles that had traditionally been reserved for men. The study also found significant synergies between civil society, government and international agencies in creating new avenues for participation and social inclusion, despite considerable resistance and numerous misunderstandings around gender equality. A confluence of favorable conditions at the macro, meso and micro levels enabled women to extent and amplify their participation in water management and in their own development. Key for this transformational process was the role played by local feminist NGOs as well as by social movements and networks supporting women’s organization.",1024739076,,Dissertations & Theses," Moraes, Andrea Ferreira Jacques deMoraesFerreira Jacques deAndreaMoraes, Andrea Ferreira Jacques de",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2709887051 , 70444492 , 66569 , 9781267430977 , 3515832 , 3515832", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267430977, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1024739076?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0595 Water Resource Management , 0630 Public policy"," 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0595 Water Resource Management , 0630 Public policy"," 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0595 Water Resource Management , 0630 Public policy",," 0344 Social research , 0453 Womens studies , 0595 Water Resource Management , 0630 Public policy"," Social research , Womens studies , Water Resource Management , Public policy"," Social sciences , Earth sciences , Brazil , Gender and development , One Million Cisterns , Participation , Rainwater harvest , Water management , Women & water",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gendered+waters%3A+The+participation+of+women+on+the+program+%E2%80%98One+Million+Cisterns%E2%80%99+in+the+Brazilian+semi-arid+region&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moraes%2C+Andrea+Ferreira+Jacques+de&amp;isbn=9781267430977&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Children of the red flag: growing up in a communist family during the cold war: a comparative analysis of the british and dutch communist movement,"This thesis assesses the extent of social isolation experienced by Dutch and British ‘children of the red flag', i.e. people who grew up in communist families during the Cold War. This study is a comparative research and focuses on the political and non-political aspects of the communist movement. By collating the existing body of biographical research and prosopographical literature with oral testimonies this thesis sets out to build a balanced picture of the British and Dutch communist movement. The study is divided into two parts. Part I discusses the political life of communists within the wider context of the history of British and Dutch communist organizations (i.e. both communist parties and their youth organizations) from 1901-1970. Part II discusses the private and public life of British and Dutch communists in the period 1940-1970. The latter draws upon oral testimonies and questions if non-political aspects of communist life were based on a Soviet model. The experiences of communist children are explored into detail within the context of the following topics; political and cultural upbringing, prescription and aspirations, neighbourhood, school &amp; education, work &amp; employment, money &amp; poverty and friendships &amp; relationships. The interviews are being used as a means of testing the accuracy of two authors in particular; Jolande Withuis and Raphael Samuel, who both published pioneering works on communist mentality. The originality of this project rests in its approach; it is a comparative research inspired by both oral history and memory studies. Instead of emphasizing the idea of a unified and centralized (international) communist movement, this thesis argues that cultural, social and political differences between Britain and the Netherlands fundamentally influenced the nature and form of their respective communist movement and explain the discrepancy between the Dutch and British respondents' experiences. Applying the comparative approach this study challenges the existing definitions of communist identity and as such it contributes to recent comparative studies of the communist movement as well as studies of communist mentality.",1040522596,,Dissertations & Theses," Weesjes, Elke MarloesWeesjesMarloesElkeWeesjes, Elke Marloes",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2762549611 , 71868052 , 101309 , U572063 , U572063 , http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/7572/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1040522596?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/7572/ , (UMI)AAIU572063 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Children+of+the+red+flag%3A+growing+up+in+a+communist+family+during+the+cold+war%3A+a+comparative+analysis+of+the+british+and+dutch+communist+movement&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Weesjes%2C+Elke+Marloes&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Post-panther dalit movements and the making of civility in india,"Civil society has come to dominate the discourses of development and social change for the last few decades. This thesis is a critical engagement with the liberal ideas of civil society; it specifically explores the politics that surfaces in the civic sphere in the context of caste inequalities through the study of Dalit socio-political organisations that occupy the margins of civil society in India. This ethnography of Dalit politics interrogates the intersections of caste and civil society in current globalised times and spaces through exploration into post-Panther phase of Dalit politics in rural Maharashtra. The focus is on two socio-political movements; one is Manavi Hakk Abhiyan (MHA), a grassroots Dalit organisation with international networks and the other is Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) a national Dalit political party. This study offers insights into the dynamic nature of caste and its vitality in constructing localised form/s of civil society in India. A common running theme in the thesis is Dalit politics of resistance and their struggle to access justice through the state despite the continued denial of justice to Dalits through fragmented institutions of the state. The study, thus, observes how the participation of Dalit movements in claiming democratic citizenship through party politics occurs alongside the marginalisation of Dalit assertion in electoral politics. Looking beyond the state, the thesis charts the relationships between Dalits and the external relational fields within which they operate: it details the vernacular modes of communication in the civic sphere where protests and violence are important modes; the innovative uses of caste and cultural repertoires by Dalit movements in challenging caste hierarchy and forming collective identities of protest; and finally, the context of global associational revolution and engagement of NGOs and INGOs as new associations in Dalit politics of resistance. This thesis contributes to the larger debates on the makings of caste and civil society in India and argues that caste and Dalit movements have a key role in constructing localised forms of civility and civil society that challenge the dynamic hierarchies and exclusions of caste.",1040533735,,Dissertations & Theses," Waghmore, SuryakantWaghmoreSuryakantWaghmore, Suryakant",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2762558181 , 71868972 , 101309 , U573001 , U573001 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/5559", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1040533735?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0700 Social structure, Social structure," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/5559 , (UMI)AAIU573001 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Post-panther+dalit+movements+and+the+making+of+civility+in+india&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Waghmore%2C+Suryakant&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Political Impact of Islamic Banking in Jordan,"This dissertation examines Islamic banking in Jordan. It is argued that institutions perceived as culturally authentic may play important political roles in a post-colonial society. Islamic banking in particular can both function in a modern, globalized economy and express cultural tradition. It may help to legitimate Jordan’s political structures and overcome social and economic bifurcations between traditional and modern sectors of society. Jordan is a part of a region of the world in which the colonial experience continues to have an enduring legacy. What had previously been a tribal Bedouin society was transformed almost overnight. Its modern banking system transgressed Islamic norms and laws and excluded huge portions of the population who continued to see meaning in the religious values and principles rooted in the social and cultural institutions that had just been trampled upon. This dissertation looks into how Islamic banks that interact in a global economy while remaining true to culturally authentic beliefs and practices can begin to close the gaps between state practice and popular beliefs. The strongest opposition to the monarchy in Jordan has come from political Islamists who feed upon popular discontent and alienation caused by the practices and actions of a ruling elite that does not share the same cultural values as the majority of the population. Much of what the Islamists espouse, while culturally authentic, is removed from the political, financial, and economic realities of the modern era. Islamic banking thus has the potential to play a mediating role between a modernizing elite and this Islamist backlash. This dissertation will test the extent to which cultural authenticity matters by observing how Islamic banks in Jordan have been able to tap into a latent demand for alternative financial practices and how the Islamic financial movement relates to Islamist political movements. Although Islamic banking has not achieved its full potential, the dissertation presents strong evidence of its capacity to bridge divisions between state and society.",1095528196,,Dissertations & Theses," Malley, Mohammed MathewMalleyMathewMohammedMalley, Mohammed Mathew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2784300201 , 65704171 , 66569 , 9781267684455 , 3530290 , 3530290", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267684455, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1095528196?accountid=14496," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0770 Banking"," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0770 Banking"," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0770 Banking",," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science , 0770 Banking"," Islamic Studies , Middle Eastern Studies , Political science , Banking"," Social sciences , Islamic banking , Islamic economics , Islamism , Jordan , Political economy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Political+Impact+of+Islamic+Banking+in+Jordan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Malley%2C+Mohammed+Mathew&amp;isbn=9781267684455&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Violence against Indigenous women: Literature, activism, resistance","This dissertation investigates literary, activist, and policy-related interventions into the social issue of violence against Indigenous women in Canada, examining key points of intersection between contemporary Indigenous resistance writing and antiviolence activist discourse. Although Indigenous resistance literature has received some critical attention in Canada, its specific relation to activist discourse remains relatively unexplored. My dissertation makes a case for reading literary texts and activist discourse in dialogue with one another, engaging a comparative frame through which to understand cultural production as an activist pursuit, while then using this frame as a reflexive means of querying the possibilities and limits of contemporary anti-violence strategies and debates. For instance, I consider how some activist discourse risks narrativizing Indigenous women's experiences of violence in ways that enforce, rather than challenge, liberal multicultural measures for social change. I then look to Indigenous cultural production as a site where the representational strategies of anti-violence campaigns can be thrown into relief, and subsequently problematized. Each chapter thus constitutes a case-study in anti-violence that investigates the question of resistance through a juxtaposed pairing of contemporary literary and activist texts or contexts. Chapter One examines the Amnesty International Stolen Sisters report for its representation of missing and murdered Indigenous women in Canada, and reads against this action-oriented text the commemorative poetry of Beth Brant and Marilyn Dumont, and the documentary filmmaking of Christine Welsh. Chapter Two problematizes the inclusionary politics of anti-racist reform as pursued in mainstream feminist anti-violence agencies, and as illustrated by the reception of Morningstar Mercredi's memoir, A Warrior's Spirit . Chapter Three turns to the issue of community-based restorative justice for Indigenous women victims of violence—reading the federal government's Aboriginal Justice Strategy and Winona LaDuke's story, ""The Women's Warrior Society"" for the tensions they reveal about ""culturally appropriate"" programming. Chapter Four interrogates the politics of memorialization, offering a critical reflection on the figure of Helen Betty Osborne as commemorated in government legislation and in David Robertson's graphic novel biography, The Life of Helen Betty Osborne . I then turn to a discussion of Anna Mae Pictou-Aquash as invited by Yvette Nolan's play, Annie Mae's Movement .

Both pitied and pilloried, unmarried women were deemed to be 'surplus' women and two institutions were established in Berlin and London to provide them with vocational training and employment: the Lette-Verein and the Society for Promoting the Employment of Women respectively. This thesis contends that a comparative study is vital in understanding their work and that hitherto undiscovered transnational lines of communication between them shaped their aims, achievements and development. A comparative perspective will reveal how not only feminists but male social reformers of the liberal bourgeoisie worked together across national boundaries in the campaign to provide middle-class women with employment. It will explore how women who took charge in both cities were not merely philanthropists, but forged their own careers as leaders and entrepreneurs. Case-studies will scrutinize and compare the businesses these institutions founded to train and employ women and analyze their varying degrees of success. This thesis will argue that the women in charge of these enterprises were compelled to negotiate a difficult boundary between commercial and welfare values to be successful. Furthermore, it will reveal that transnational networks were consolidated by men and women who exchanged information and ideas across national boundaries. They were keen to compete with their foreign contemporaries, yet found valuable support from their associates abroad. This thesis concludes that transnational cooperation between men and women in the mid-1860s formed the basis of a more formal international women's movement in the late nineteenth century.",1327100005,,Dissertations & Theses," Richmond, Sarah LouiseRichmondLouiseSarahRichmond, Sarah Louise",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2945262361 , 73437082 , 101309 , U581863 , U581863 , http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/13318/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1327100005?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0335 European history, European history," http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/13318/ , 555384 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Philanthropy%2C+entrepreneurship+and+transnational+exchange%3A+women%27s+campaigns+for+employment+in+berlin+and+london%2C+1859-1900&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Richmond%2C+Sarah+Louise&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"From Global Entertainment to Amazonian &lt;i&gt;Tecnobrega&lt;/i&gt;: Mobility in Contemporary Entertainment Practices,"Notions such as transference, movement, transit and mobility have become fundamental to understand the mechanisms that rule the circulation, reception and production of contemporary cultural artifacts. In spite of the growing scholarship on the topic, very little attention has been given to a particular cultural arena: the realm of contemporary entertainment. By contemporary entertainment, I refer to a set of industrial products which are especially directed to urban young audiences: cartoons, comic books, computer games, blockbuster movies, theme park attractions, etc. This thesis argues that the realm of contemporary entertainment is marked by the presence of intense mobility, by movement and acceleration on at least two levels. First, movies ( The Matrix, City of God, Run Lola Run, etc.), TV programs (the so-called “MTV aesthetics”), computer games ( Doom or games based on blockbusters) and even cartoons for children ( Spongebob, Pokémon, etc.) present frantic editing and engage the audiences’ senses through moving images in a vertiginous “bombardment” of signs – a phenomenon I will call kinesthesics. Second, the production and reception of these cultural objects take place in a highly intermedial environment: computer games become feature movies ( Tomb Raider, Resident Evil ), comic books become feature movies ( Sin City, Spiderman, etc.) feature movies become theme park attractions ( Jurassic Park ), theme park attractions become feature movies ( Pirates of the Caribbean ) and so on. This thesis shows how these two basic mobile characteristics play a determinant role in the complex economic, technologic and aisthesic rationale that drives the contemporary entertainment industry. The investigation of these basic traits suggests the existence of mobility paradigms that help us better understand not only products like the ones mentioned above, but also disparate cultural artifacts such as the Brazilian aparelhagem – a traveling technological paraphernalia that brings musical entertainment to poor audiences in the Brazilian Amazon Region. Aparelhagens present an intricate blending of physical displacement, media mobility, visual spectacle and musical frenzy. This successful combination propels a popular and powerful entertainment industry in Northern Brazil known as tecnobrega. By analyzing the phenomenon and comparing it to global entertainment products, the thesis discloses aisthesic patterns that cross social, economic and cultural boundaries.",1364888134,,Dissertations & Theses," Bahia, MarcioBahiaMarcioBahia, Marcio",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2988320681 , 79380562 , 66569 , 9780494981771 , NR98177 , NR98177", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9780494981771, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1364888134?accountid=14496," 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0708 Mass communications , 0814 Recreation , 0900 Film studies"," 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0708 Mass communications , 0814 Recreation , 0900 Film studies"," 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0708 Mass communications , 0814 Recreation , 0900 Film studies",," 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0708 Mass communications , 0814 Recreation , 0900 Film studies"," Multimedia Communications , Mass communications , Recreation , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Aparelhagem , Entertainment industry , Mobility , Tecnobrega",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+Global+Entertainment+to+Amazonian+Tecnobrega%3A+Mobility+in+Contemporary+Entertainment+Practices&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bahia%2C+Marcio&amp;isbn=9780494981771&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Christianity in contemporary Japan: towards an ecumenical theology of mission,"This thesis is a cross-disciplinary contribution to Christian identity and mission in Japan. Its modus operandi is to investigate how local Christians as a small minority in a religiously diverse culture interpret ""home"" missions and link them with international trends. The concept of ""glocalisation"" will be utilised - this word being Japanese in origin but extended in meaning by European and North American academics who turned the opposite ideas of local and global into a neologism that has captured the imagination of business and religious leaders the world over. Following the introduction and literature review, archival research gives present-day Christianity in Japan the necessary background for the middle section of the thesis - namely, semi-structured, face-to-face interviews with 21 Christian leaders in the Kansai area, where many ecumenical programmes have been developed. The interviews will demonstrate how Kansai Christians have highly sophisticated methods of co-ordinating ecumenical social action activities with interfaith dialogue. The data from these interviews (backed by official statistics) confirm church population has not grown as much as Christians had expected but is a source of social capital in a religiously diverse society: a large number of people were found to be interested in Christianity as an educational and social movement and in its Christian-based social work both at home and abroad. The final chapters of the thesis outline my missiology and adopts the slogan coined by the French-American ecologist Rene Dubos, ""Think globally, act locally"" as the currency that will provide the payment for a truly ecumenical approach to mission and evangelisation.

Based on the oral narratives of ninety men and women, it traces the activist trajectory from child to adulthood to understand the social, psychological, and cultural processes informing the political and personal transformation of young adults within the new left cultures that emerged in the wake of Britain’s anti-war movement, the Vietnam Solidarity Campaign (VSC). To this end the study charts the development of the political and cultural shifts on the left over the decade from the early 1960s to the early 1970s. It shows how throughout this period dialogue between inner and outer activist life occurred against a background of ongoing realignment on the left from a fluid, eclectic cultural network around the VSC to a demarcated post- VSC left after 1969, that saw increasing divergence between a non-aligned libertarian New Left on the one hand and a Trotskyist far left milieu on the other. The study seeks to claim a valid space for Britain’s left activist landscape within the political, social and cultural framework of ‘1968’ and British post-war historiography. Privileging individual and collective subjectivities, the thesis examines ways of belonging inside Trotskyist and non-aligned left milieux by situating the respondents, their radical histories and activist cultures within the changing post-war fabric. It shows that investigating individual and collective memories provides deeper understanding of the ‘cognitive maps’ that young men and women created, as they attempted to situate themselves as radical, global beings as well as local, gendered social citizens. As micro-studies the individual stories reveal how the experience of social, emotional and political maturation from child to adult intersected with a specific social and political moment – the formation of a new and distinctive left culture that came to full fruition only in the aftermath of 1968 with the arrival of Women’s Liberation and the new personal politics. Exploring the social and psychological impact of post-war childhood and youth, the study engages with the political and emotional impact of Women’s Liberation on the men and women within the cultural context of the different left milieux. Overall, the thesis questions how, from the mid-1960s to the early 1970s, the variant cultures of the milieux penetrated public and private spaces, and shaped early life experiences of work, political activity, family, and political and personal relations in order to understand how activism shaped social patterns and psychic being.",1415312725,,Dissertations & Theses," Hughes, Celia P.HughesP.CeliaHughes, Celia P.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031715331 , 80744842 , 101309 , U591064 , U591064 , http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/49428/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415312725?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history,, 0335 European history, European history," http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/49428/ , (UMI)AAIU591064 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+socio-cultural+milieux+of+the+left+in+post-war+Britain&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hughes%2C+Celia+P.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Changing social relations: a study exploring the roles, responsibilities and relationships of employers with learning difficulties and their personal assistants","Cash payments in the form of direct payments have become an essential tool in the distribution and provision of social care support. This development has been hailed to represent ‘a potentially revolutionary challenge to [the] unequal relationship between providers and receivers of care’ (Glasby &amp; Littlechild 2002: 137), which has shifted the position of social care recipients from ‘service users’ to commissioners, developers and managers of their own support and created the role of personal assistant. This thesis explores this challenge through the experiences of newly created ‘employers’ with learning difficulties and their personal assistants, within the discourses of independence, choice, control and empowerment which stand as central principles within the personalisation agenda (DH 2007a; DH 2007b). The personalisation agenda is argued to be situated within the at once competing and complementary analysis of the Independent Living Movement and New Labour’s analysis of the ‘new global realities’ (Cerny &amp; Evans 2004), which requires a re-negotiation between the citizen and the state. These direct employment relationships represent one of the critical points at which our relationship with the state is in the process of flux. It is this, our relationship with the state in social care, heralding new forms of responsibilised citizenship in the form of citizen-consumers (Clarke et al 2007) and citizen entrepreneurs (Scourfield 2007), in combination with the changing social relations of support in the form of personal assistants, that is of interest. Drawing on disability studies and feminist analysis situated within the political economy, this thesis explores, with equal interest, the experiences of employers and personal assistants. Whilst it is clear from this project and others (Gramlich et al 2002; Stainton &amp; Boyce 2004; Prideaux et al 2009) that directly employing personal assistance offers the opportunity to create a personalised support arrangement, however questions emerged around the equality of that opportunity and implications for a workforce which has historically remained low status, low paid and unsupported (Ungerson 1997a). These questions brought into perspective how ‘empowerment’ is experienced and encouraged an analysis in which support relationships are characterised as much by ‘interdependence’ as ‘independence’, questioning the extent to which the ‘commodification’ (Ungerson 1997b) of support represented the value, or lever of empowerment. Rather, it was the personal and in-formalised aspects of these relationships that offered value and which returns us to a recognition of the social in the personal.",1415368050,,Dissertations & Theses," Graham, KatherineGrahamKatherineGraham, Katherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031744541 , 73440542 , 101309 , U588820 , U588820 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/2425/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415368050?accountid=14496, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology, 0624 Occupational psychology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0624 Occupational psychology, Occupational psychology," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/2425/ , 556479 , Psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Changing+social+relations%3A+a+study+exploring+the+roles%2C+responsibilities+and+relationships+of+employers+with+learning+difficulties+and+their+personal+assistants&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Graham%2C+Katherine&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Reconstructing human rights: a pragmatic and pluralist inquiry in global ethics,"This work sets out to critically reconstruct human rights as both an ethical ideal and a political practice. I critique conventional moral justifications of human rights and the related role they play in legitimating political authority, arguing that the pluralism and political content of human rights cannot be eliminated. I reconstruct the relationship between ethics and politics through an engagement with pragmatist and pluralist moral theory, which I then develop into a democratising account of human rights by incorporating work on agonistic democracy. The resulting view of human rights is situated and agonistic, seeing the act of claiming human rights as a political act that makes demands on the social order in the name of a particular ethical ideal. Rather than seeing the political act of claiming rights as undermining human rights as universal moral principles, it becomes essential to global ethics as such. The international political aspect of rights is then examined by looking to the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in historical context, and contrasting human rights practice as expressed in popular social movements with conventional state-centric and legalist accounts. In the end the defence of human rights that is offered aims to preserve the transformative power of human rights claims, their democratising content, while undermining their totalising tendency, in which a singular conception of humanity provides certain moral principles to legitimate political authority.",1415368391,,Dissertations & Theses," Hoover, JosephHooverJosephHoover, Joseph",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031744081 , 74051612 , 101309 , U588795 , U588795 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/329/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415368391?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0616 International law, International law," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/329/ , 550747 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reconstructing+human+rights%3A+a+pragmatic+and+pluralist+inquiry+in+global+ethics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hoover%2C+Joseph&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The confederation paysanne as 'peasant' movement: re-appropriating 'peasantness' for the advancement of organisational interests,"As a founding member of the Via Campesina (1993) and active participant in the Global Justice Movement (the altermondialiste movement in France), the Confederation paysanne (CP) - which literally stands for 'peasant confederation' - has been presented in academic and activist circles as a key player in the struggle against neoliberal globalisation, and as a contributor to the emergence of new transnational activist networks and a 'global civil society'. As a trade union representing the interests of 'peasants', the CP has been praised as an innovative form of professional organisation whose originality lies in its ability to defend farmers' interests while at the same time responding to a broader set of challenges for the planet and those who populate it (environmental degradation, cultural homogeneity, social injustice). As a result, the CP - and in particular its emblematic leader Jose Bove - was rapidly propelled to the forefront of a new progressive avant-garde whose discourse on the cultural and economic threats of neoliberalism found a positive echo in farming and non-farming circles alike. -- Yet, as I shall argue throughout the following pages, the CP's success was not only related to its successful response to the new challenges for the 'peasantry' and society but also to its re-appropriation of popular and essentialist representations of 'peasantness' as a timeless and intrinsically egalitarian condition. From the moment that we recognise this, our understanding of the union's evolving popularity changes. Many observers and activists, for example, explained the CP's disappointing result in the 2007 professional elections by arguing that the CP was ahead of its time.",1415368911,,Dissertations & Theses," Morena, EdouardMorenaEdouardMorena, Edouard",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031744721 , 80748642 , 101309 , U590193 , U590193 , https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-confederation-paysanne-as-peasant-movement(0c81f776-ea63-4fd8-8139-d49d5caaaaf8).html", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415368911?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-confederation-paysanne-as-peasant-movement(0c81f776-ea63-4fd8-8139-d49d5caaaaf8).html , (UMI)AAIU590193 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+confederation+paysanne+as+%27peasant%27+movement%3A+re-appropriating+%27peasantness%27+for+the+advancement+of+organisational+interests&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Morena%2C+Edouard&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Reception conditions and asylum in Ireland and the United Kingdom: human rights and the emergence of control.,"This thesis examines reception conditions for asylum and protection seekers in Ireland and the United Kingdom (UK). Asylum and protection seekers in Ireland and the UK, will live in the host state away and apart from the host communities, on a much lower standard of living than the lowest paid social assistance recipient and will have their movements, actions, living arrangements and behaviour closely monitored. The welfare state in Ireland and the UK is utilised as the key conduit in protecting socio-economic rights of the most vulnerable within society. Reception conditions for asylum and protection seekers should protect civil, political, economic, social and cultural human rights. This thesis is concerned with the social supports that have been put in place in Ireland and the UK to host asylum and perfection seekers. Social supports currently include: accommodation, provision of sustenance, welfare payments, educational rights and medical care. Both Ireland and the UK have a developed welfare state. Both states subscribe to key international instruments that protect socio-economic rights. Over time, asylum and protection seekers were fully excluded from mainstream social assistance structures in place. The processes used to achieve this separation, and the arguments made to justify a lower level of socio-economic rights protection for those seeking asylum, are explored in this thesis, drawing on an expanded and revised understanding of the culture of control.",1415370219,,Dissertations & Theses," Thornton, L.ThorntonL.Thornton, L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031744831 , 74051932 , 101309 , U589646 , U589646", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415370219?accountid=14496, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy, 0630 Public policy,, 0630 Public policy, Public policy," (UMI)AAIU589646 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reception+conditions+and+asylum+in+Ireland+and+the+United+Kingdom%3A+human+rights+and+the+emergence+of+control.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Thornton%2C+L.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Public engagement with multiculturalism: a social representations approach to identity dynamics in london and new york,"In recent years, the word ‘multiculturalism’ has become a central preoccupation for scholars and the public alike. The term is inconsistently, yet increasingly, used as experts and lay people attempt to make sense of the national, ethnic and religious diversity that surrounds them in everyday life. Multiculturalism movements seek to achieve diversity, allowing different lifestyles, traditions and world-views to be recognized as legitimate. However, assimilation movements oppose such diversification, and foster the emergence of a ‘global village’. It is within this binary context that individuals and groups oscillate between moving closer together and protecting the space of the self. Using Social Representation Theory as the central framework, this thesis aims to investigate the manifest and latent symbolic underpinnings of British and American public engagement with multiculturalism. Furthermore, the interplay between these representations and people’s identity work is examined. Based on a rigorous, cross-cultural, qualitative design including 96 interviews with members of the general public in London and New York, major thematic tropes of public engagement with multiculturalism are extrapolated, and the meanings people attach to multiculturalism are explored. Results from this investigation show that social representations of multiculturalism are built upon the similarity/difference ‘thema’. This ‘thema’ becomes evident in pragmatic manifestations such as food, geographical spaces (e.g. the city/outside the city), or symbolic spaces (e.g. comfort zone/moving outside the comfort zone). Furthermore, pragmatic manifestations are underscored by normative evaluations of multiculturalism, including issues of openmindedness/ narrow-mindedness and familiarity/strangeness. Taken together, pragmatic manifestations and evaluations of multiculturalism are entwined with identity processes. Two systematic ‘othering’ processes are discussed accounting for the projection of unwanted, and the introjection of wanted elements of multiculturalism. People are found to avail themselves of ‘cosmopolitan identity projects’ in London and New York, where multiculturalism allows them to become more knowledgeable, open-minded and global.",1442496514,,Dissertations & Theses," Gekeler, B.

By examining cattle raising in Acre, where decades earlier the rubber tapper social movement confronted cattle ranchers and became a global symbol of environmentalism, we can gain a deeper understanding of the economic, social, and cultural changes occurring in one of Amazonia's most politically significant regions. Data collected using participant observation and semi-structured, structured, and key-informant interviews were analyzed to understand the growing economic and cultural significance of cattle in the lives of Acreans. The expansion of cattle raising among three rural social groups (rubber tappers, colonists, and ranchers) is the result of political economic changes, shifts in inter-group relationships, and the growth of positive cultural perceptions of cattle. Each group's use of cattle is based on their unique social identities, relationships with political institutions, and traditional forms of economic practice. Distinct uses of cattle give rise to specific relationships with cattle, and subsequently to unique forms of cattle culture, which contribute to and are subsumed by a dominant cattle culture, based on a ranching mode of production. Acrean cattle culture emerged in part from local economic practices, but its primary features were diffused directly and indirectly from traditional cattle ranching centers in Brazil and the United States. Cattle culture is expressed through participation in popular cultural events associated with cattle, the construction of cattle-centered landscapes in which nature is dominated by humans, and agreement with perceptions that attribute superiority to a vision of rural life based on cattle raising. This dissertation analyzes the extent to which different groups, from environmentalists to cowboys, participate in cattle culture activities and events. Cultural consensus analysis is used to compare the extent to which different groups agree with perceptions of cattle culture. This dissertation contributes to our knowledge of the relationship between material and conceptual drivers in the creation, circulation, and appropriation of cultural forms related to cattle.",1517207429,,Dissertations & Theses," Hoelle, Jeffrey AndrewHoelleAndrewJeffreyHoelle, Jeffrey Andrew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3278059091 , 63564691 , 66569 , 9781303818912 , 3586303 , 3586303", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781303818912, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1517207429?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Acre , Amazonia , Brazil , Cattle , Diffusion",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cattle+culture+in+Amazonia%3A+The+rise+of+ranching+in+Acre%2C+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hoelle%2C+Jeffrey+Andrew&amp;isbn=9781303818912&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"New Economies of Sex and Intimacy in Vietnam,"Over the past two decades, scholars have paid particular attention to the growth of global sex tourism, a trade marked by convergence between the global and local production and consumption of sexual services. In the increasingly global economy, the movement of people and capital around the world creates new segments of sex work, with diverse groups of consumers and providers. This dissertation examines the dialectical link between intimacy and political economy. I examine how changes in the global economy structure relations of intimacy between clients and sex workers; and how intimacy can be a vital form of currency that shapes economic and political relations. I trace new economies of sex and intimacy in Vietnam by moving from daily worlds of sex work in Ho Chi Minh City [HCMC] to incorporate a more structural and historical analysis. Drawing on 15 months of ethnography (2009-2010) working as a bartender and hostess I analyze four different bars that cater to wealthy local Vietnamese men and their Asian business partners, overseas Vietnamese men living in the diaspora, Western expatriates, and Western budget travelers. Drawing on 180 informal interviews with 90 clients and 90 sex workers across four niche markets of HCMC's sex industry, my dissertation incorporates three levels of analysis. I show how contemporary processes of globalization re-stratify an already stratified sex industry in HCMC, as well as how the industry is a vital player in the generation of business. Vietnam's opening to foreign direct investment since Doi Moi in 1986 has created a domestic super-élite, connected to the levers of political power, who channel incoming foreign capital to specific projects in real estate and manufacturing. For this super-élite, conspicuous consumption provides both a lexicon of distinction and a means of communicating hospitality to potential investors from Taiwan, Hong Kong, and other East Asian countries -- and, using a different symbolic vocabulary, to Western investors. A new, ultra-high-end tier of sex workers has emerged in tandem with the emergence of this new group of clients. These sex workers only succeed to the extent that they can deploy the right vocabularies of consumption and sexuality in an elaborate symbolic dance tailored to the needs of individual capital deals. They are valued not only for their beauty, but also for their ability to help their clients project masculinity, deference, and collegiality in the specific context of entertaining foreign investors: they must also be able to modify this performance for East Asian clients as well as white clients. As a result, racialized desires, social status, business success, and hope for upward mobility are all played out in the bars of HCMC. The same is true in the middle and lower tiers of the industry, but in radically different ways. In short, HCMC's sex industry is not just a microcosm of the global economy, but also a vector shaping financial globalization itself. I examine how sex workers, male clients, bar owners, mommies (formally known as madams), and the police all work to create and maintain certain types of raced and gendered hierarchies according to the niche in which they are involved. I also focus on the practices of everyday life in the bars and examine how men and women construct their relations with each other, which lead to different kinds of intimate and emotional relationships that sometimes allow women to experience mobility, but at other times are self-destructive. Sex work, I argue, provides a unique lens through which to examine not only how transformations in the global economy reshape intimate life but also how the emotional intimacy (and not merely sex) provided by sex workers serves as an important currency in transnational business deals. Comparing four niche markets within HCMC's sex industry, I found that local Vietnamese men and their Asian business partners participate in business-related entertainment while Western expatriates, in contrast, participate in HCMC's sex industry for recreational purposes outside of work. Racialized desires, status, business success, and hope for upward mobility are all played out in the bars of HCMC, where dreams and deals are traded.

Using the concept of publics as a theoretical tool, it explores how, through mediated communication, forum organisers and communication activists seek to extend the WSF in time and space and thereby make it public. Engaging critically with the idea of the WSF as a global process, the thesis considers how mediated communication might contribute to making the WSF global, not so much in absolute terms as by creating a sense of globality, and how the idea of the global relates to other scales. It develops an understanding of the WSF as an epistemic project that seeks both to affirm the existence and validity of multiple knowledges and to facilitate convergence between them, and considers how different communication practices might further this project. Based on ethnographic research carried out in connection with the WSF 2009 in Belém, complemented by fieldwork at other social forums, the thesis is structured as a series of case studies of different communication practices, ranging from efforts to engage with conventional mass media to various initiatives that seek to strengthen movement-based communication infrastructures and enable WSF participants to communicate on their own terms. These demonstrate that there are many different approaches to making the WSF 'public' and 'global', which beyond facilitating the circulation of media content also involve mobilising new actors to participate in media production and generating a sense of identification with a global WSF process. They also show that mediated communication can contribute to knowledge production not only by facilitating information sharing, but also through the more subtle processes of empowerment, network-building, and translation across difference it can stimulate when embedded in movement dynamics.",1683608407,,Dissertations & Theses," Stephansen, HildeStephansenHildeStephansen, Hilde",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3697540951 , 94014102 , 101309 , U634888 , U634888 , http://research.gold.ac.uk/6570/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1683608407?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://research.gold.ac.uk/6570/ , (UMI)AAIU634888 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Making+global+publics%3F%3A+communication+and+knowledge+production+in+the+world+social+forum+process&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stephansen%2C+Hilde&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The politics of reparations and apologies: the differential application of restorative justice following stat atrocity,"Today, it is nearly a given that groups seeking redress or reparation for past wrongs will receive some fonn of justice. Groups wronged by states often seek and receive apologies and compensation, to the point that it is now worthy of discussion when groups do not receive some form of compensation or acknowledgement. Yet how did this widespread acceptance of redress and reparation emerge? This thesis seeks an answer to this question, while also seeking to understand why it is that different groups, having experienced similar atrocities, have received varying degrees of redress. In order to do so, this thesis examines three countries and two victimised groups within each state-sponsored atrocity. In Germany, the Nazi government perpetrated genocide upon both Jews and Roma; in the United States, Japanese Americans and Japanese Latin Americans were both interned during World War II and, in the third case study, the Japanese military systematically enslaved and raped both Korean and Dutch women within occupied territories. In each of these cases, one victimised group bad more relative success in achieving redress and reparation than the other. This thesis thus considers the key historical background to the various social movements, the development of the social movements themselves and the gradual emergence of international norms and political opportunities which have combined to encourage what is today known as the redress and reparation movement. The thesis also seeks to determine factors which explain the differential success of social movements of groups which have experienced similar atrocities.",1775196992,,Dissertations & Theses," Wolfe, StephanieWolfeStephanieWolfe, Stephanie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3992906371 , 103111842 , 101309 , 10037186 , 10037186", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1775196992?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10037186 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+politics+of+reparations+and+apologies%3A+the+differential+application+of+restorative+justice+following+stat+atrocity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wolfe%2C+Stephanie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"E-research in the life sciences: from invisible to virtual colleges,"e-Research in the Life Sciences examines the use of online tools in the life sciences and finds that their use has significant impact, namely the formation of a Scientific/Intellectual Movement (SIM) (Frickel &amp; Gross, 2005) complemented by a Computerisation Movement (CM) (Kling &amp; Iacono, 1994) which is mobilising global electronic resources to form visible colleges of life science researchers, who are enrolling others and successfully promoting their open science goals via mainstream scientific literature. Those within this movement are also using these online tools to change their work practices, producing scientific knowledge in a highly networked and distributed group which has less regard for traditional institutional and disciplinary boundaries. This thesis, by combining ideas about SIMs and CMs, fills a gap in research that is typically confined to treating new tools as a part of scientific communication or in specialist areas like distributed collaboration but not in terms of broader changes in science. Case studies have been conducted for three types of online tools: the scientific social networking tool FriendFeed, open laboratory notebooks, and science blogs. Data have been collected from semi-structured interviews, and the online writings of research participants. The case studies of exemplary use by scientists of the web form a baseline for future studies in the area. Boundaries between formal and informal scholarly communication are now blurred. At the formal level, which peer-reviewed print journals continue, many academic publishers now also have online open access, frequently in advance of print publication. At the informal level, what used to be confined to water-cooler chat and the conference circuit is now also discussed on mailing lists, forums and blogs (Borgman, 2007).

How do we reconcile the persistence of a Europe of fragmented nation-states and the European integration project based on the principle of free movement? This duality is indicative of different geographical visions: between space defined as places and space defined as unifying flows. While places tend to be associated with fixed territories and borders, it is argued that complex global flows and connections may disrupt such notions. Addressing these theoretical tensions, this thesis examines transnational frameworks for discussing the reconfiguration of borders and spaces within the European Union. The aim of this research is to explore the extent to which European Union citizens, with freedom of movement, experience mobility between member states in a frictionless manner. The thesis adopts a “bottom-up” approach of migrants’ experiences and perceptions of internal borders, as barriers or opportunities to their movement and settlement. This is illustrated through the case of Britons resident in France. The thesis draws on data generated through qualitative methods, including fifty-three in-depth interviews undertaken in an ethnographic setting. The case study demonstrates how a frictionless European space does not exist for ordinary European Union citizens, for a variety of political, legal, economic and socio-cultural reasons. The analysis reveals how Britons recreate (national) state borders, by adapting to French politico-legal structures, and identifying boundaries between “us” and “them”. The thesis also identifies how transnational spaces are created through immigrants’ social networks. By exploring the everyday lives of intra-EU migrants, the thesis contributes to literature on British migrants in France, and provides an original contribution to studies of EU integration, focused on ordinary citizens on the move.",1779218486,,Dissertations & Theses," Ferbrache, FionaFerbracheFionaFerbrache, Fiona",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013159271 , 103730522 , 101309 , U567812 , U567812 , http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/454", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779218486?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0366 Geography, Geography," http://hdl.handle.net/10026.1/454 , 535718 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+spaces+within+the+european+union%3A+the+geographies+of+british+migrants+in+france&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ferbrache%2C+Fiona&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Volunteering for the beijing 2008 olympic games: visions, policies and capitals","This research examines the use of volunteering at the Beijing 2008 Olympic Games for the creation of human, social and political capital at individual, organisational and societal levels. Despite a long tradition of Olympic volunteering, this has not been investigated so far. The concept of volunteerism at Beijing 2008, in fact, was constructed upon multiple contexts including the Olympic Movement, Chinese society and an international understanding of the ternl (BOCOG, 2005). Hence, volunteerism as an under-investigated concept is firstly studied individually in each of these contexts. The frameworks underpinning this research include Getz's (2005) human resource planning process which explains how specific policies for managing event volunteers are formulated for fulfilling its vision(s); and theories of social, human and political capital as developed by Putnam (2000), Bourdieu (1986; 1991) and Coleman (1988) respectively. Multiple qualitative case study strategy is adopted for this investigation, following a constructivist paradigm. The subjective and interactive epistemology is constructed upon the knowledge and experiences of a total of fifty-seven infoIDlants, most of whom were directly involved in the Beijing 2008 Olympic Volunteer Programme. The research findings illustrate that the Chinese state and BOCOG's interpretation of the concept of volunteerisrn was manifested in organisational visions for the Beijing 2008 Olympic Volunteer Programme. These visions were accomplished through a range of management policies, which in fact placed volunteerism at Beijing 2008 in line with the maturity stage of volunteerism in the Olympic Movement. During the course of the management practices, social, human and political capital were created in varying degrees at all of the three levels. It was also evident that participation and training were the critical processes in the creation of different forms of capital. Moreover, the findings suggest that the created social, human and political capital have both positive and negative effects on those involved, while full possible long-term effects are yet to become apparent. This research makes distinctive contributions to the body of knowledge. It adds six-dimensional conceptual frameworks for both volunteerism in general and Olympic volunteerism in specific. Investigation into how volunteering for the Beijing Games has been used for the creation of social, human and political capital at individual, organisational and societal levels is deemed to be original. Research findings will contribute to the development of volunteerism in the Olympic Movement and future Olympic volunteer programmes. Suggestions for future research are also proposed to investigate on further issues of issue of the use of volunteering for the creation of social, human and political capital at future Olympic Games as well as other mega events.",1779543523,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhuang, JuanZhuangJuanZhuang, Juan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015149581 , 103661372 , 101309 , 10057305 , 10057305 , http://hdl.handle.net/10547/294459", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779543523?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/10547/294459 , (UMI)AAI10057305 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Volunteering+for+the+beijing+2008+olympic+games%3A+visions%2C+policies+and+capitals&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhuang%2C+Juan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Conflict and consensus within the paralympic field: a sociological investigation of an elite disability sport competition,"This research provides a sociological investigation of an elite disability sport competition known as the Paralympic Games. A quadrennial multi-sport competition for individuals with specific impairments, the Paralympic Games, is explored in this thesis through the method of semi-structured interviews. Individuals interviewed included current and former Paralympians, active and retired disability sport administrators as well as social researchers of disability and disability sport. A number of themes surface in this research which identifies and begins to explore the relationships between the core constituents which influence the Paralympic Games. Assertions about which bodies have a legitimate claim to be involved in Paralympic sport, alongside how impaired bodies are used to create an elite disability sport spectacle, such as the Paralympic Games, remain contested by members and organisations that influence, through consensus and conflict, the development of the Paralympic Movement. The Paralympic Games, of course, has not developed in isolation, but in the context of wider developments across sport. In relation to this the positive and negative influences of the International Olympic Committee upon the Paralympic Games are considered. At the core of the thesis, critical analysis has been generated through the use of the social theory of Pierre Bourdieu. In particular Bourdieu's related concepts of habitus, capital and field, in conjunction with previous research into the Paralympic Movement and the extant literature in the field of disability studies, are used to illuminate the existence of a Paralympic field. The possible manifestation of a Paralympic field is explored through the empirical data collected. As a result this thesis highlights the nexus between the sociology of sport and disability studies. Through the fusion of these fields, and by grounding them in a robust theoretical framework, it is hoped that this research will add positively to the literature in this emerging specialism of the sociology of disability sport.",1779550744,,Dissertations & Theses," Purdue, DavidPurdueDavidPurdue, David",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015147671 , 102697862 , 101309 , 10087344 , 10087344 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/8367", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779550744?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/8367 , (UMI)AAI10087344 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Conflict+and+consensus+within+the+paralympic+field%3A+a+sociological+investigation+of+an+elite+disability+sport+competition&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Purdue%2C+David&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The changing geographies of international municipal relations in europe: a study of british-german town twinning partnerships,"Since the end of WWII, the establishment of the very first European town twinning partnerships between the UK and Germany has been followed by thousands of twinning partnerships and millions of citizens travelling across Europe taking part in professional, student, family, project, sport or cultural twinning exchanges. However, surprisingly little is known about the history and contemporary practices of town twinning. Although of great relevance to current debates about European identity creation, global cultures, neoliberalism and entrepreneurial cities, politics of scale and transnational urban networks, only very few geographers have seriously investigated this phenomenon. The aim of this thesis is therefore to analyse the scope of contemporary town twinning practices against the background of the international municipal movement in Europe and to investigate this multi-faceted phenomenon, its organisation, procedures and changing aims from a British-German twinning perspective. More than 60 years after its initiation as a movement for reconciliation and international understanding in Europe, how do current town twinning practices reflect the challenges of a globalised world? The thesis is based on rich empirical research in Bristol, Cardiff, Loughborough, St.Helens, and Hannover, Schwäbisch Hall, and Stuttgart (constituting four British- German town twinning partnerships between them), including interviews with volunteers and professionals involved in town twinning, archival research and participant observation. Themes covered extensively are the usages and impacts of town twinning activities for the creation of European awareness among citizens, and for the promotion of urban competitiveness and cooperation through municipal networking. Since town twinning has developed over the years without a universal definition or guidelines, most municipalities have generated their very own way of doing town twinning, often but not always characterised by dichotomies, such as small towns vs. big cities, citizens vs. local authorities, citizens‟ meetings vs. urban projects, cultural vs. economic objectives, etc. A key parameter for the direction of a twinning partnership is individuals, e.g. mayors or committed citizens, who leave their mark on the partnership's aims, contents, and/or organisation. Hence, the question if town twinning is changing or adapting its aims for a globalised world has to be answered by every municipality individually. However, a general development towards a 'modern' form of town twinning that focuses on economic benefits and short-term inter-municipal projects at the expense of 'traditional' cultural twinning has not been observed. Rather in an increasing number of municipalities, the former complements the latter in a 'contemporary' form of town twinning. This thesis has introduced the 'dark horse' town twinning into the geographical debate, uncovering its history, analysing its current practices, and relating it to relevant social, cultural, urban and political geographical discourses.",1788101356,,Dissertations & Theses," Grosspietsch, JuliaGrosspietschJuliaGrosspietsch, Julia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018800101 , 102697862 , 101309 , 10047483 , 10047483 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/8346", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1788101356?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/8346 , (UMI)AAI10047483 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+changing+geographies+of+international+municipal+relations+in+europe%3A+a+study+of+british-german+town+twinning+partnerships&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grosspietsch%2C+Julia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"La via campesina and the committee on world food security: a transnational public sphere?: identifying and interrogating dynamics of power and voice in transnational food and agricultural policy processes,"The transnationalisation of economic relations and the emergence of supranational sites of policy-making and governance have been of concern both to 'affected publics' subject to the remote decisionmaking that such developments entail (and who have mobilised extensively to demonstrate their opposition to these bodies), and scholars keen to locate the possibilities for a democratic politics in the context of the state's subsequent diminishment (O'Brien et al., 2000; Scholte, 2001; Patomäki and Teivainen, 2004; Rittberger et al., 2008). One such group of scholars are public sphere theorists, who, taking up an ongoing concern with the conditions for, and criteria of, effective democratic participation in politically authoritative policy debates, and responding to these new dynamics, have begun to define a new research agenda in search of 'transnational public spheres' (Habermas, 1989; Fraser, 1991; Fraser 2007). That is, they have begun to look to the transnational for sites in which those affected by the exercise (or, indeed, absence) of political authority at this level strive to engage that authority in policy debate. In this thesis, I argue for the existence of one such transnational public sphere, which, being both provoked and constituted by the transnational peasant and small farmers social movement La Via Campesina, promises to be institutionally realised by the recently reformed United Nations Committee on World Food Security (CFS).

Based on fieldwork in West Africa and North America, including participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and content analysis of relevant documents, the thesis locates these groups within the wider politics of both the feminist movement and the peace movement. The thesis draws on three bodies of literature: feminist international relations, especially literature on women and war, feminist analyses of security and the relationship between militarism and patriarchy; peace studies, especially the concepts of the “positive” and “negative” peace, conflict transformation, and nonviolence; and social movement theory, especially in reference to collective identity and tactical repertoires of protest. The thesis investigates the relationship between “women”, “motherhood”, “feminism” and peace, concluding that, while women peace activists may organize around gendered identities, the relationship between women and peace is more complex than an essentialist position would propose. A detailed analysis of the tactical repertoires used by women peace activists examines activists’ gendered use of bodies and the manipulation and exploitation of gender and age stereotypes. This is followed by an analysis of the internal and external outcomes of activism, such as personal empowerment, collective identity formation, and policy impacts. The study concludes that women peace activists operate on understandings of “peace” and “security” that are distinct from those of mainstream actors; that they manipulate, challenge, and subvert gender stereotypes; and they use a range of protest and peacebuilding tactics, some of which attract reprisals from the state. Women’s peace activism also creates new political opportunities for women to express opposition to patriarchal militarism, thus challenging the marginalization of women within international and national politics on issues of peace and security. Following Cynthia Cockburn (2007), the thesis draws conclusions not about what women’s peace activism definitively is, but rather what it can look like and what it might achieve.",1799225435,,Dissertations & Theses," Pedersen, JenniferPedersenJenniferPedersen, Jennifer",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4099085121 , 106035512 , 101309 , U570115 , U570115 , http://hdl.handle.net/2160/7168", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, English, English,,2011,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1799225435?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0700 Social structure, Social structure," http://hdl.handle.net/2160/7168 , (UMI)AAIU570115 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sisters+resist%21%3A+women%27s+peace+activism+in+west+africa+and+north+america&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pedersen%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Carbon intensity of UK household consumption : Scenarios to 2030,"As part of the Research group on Lifestyles, Values and Environment (RESOLVE), at the University of Surrey, UK, this PhD study involves the development of a set of scenarios depicting the carbon intensity of UK household consumption over the next 20 years. A set of four scenario narratives are developed, accompanied by illustrative quantitative figures. The thesis sets out some of the background factors pertinent to this study, including economic, energy and environmental uncertainties, and establishes how household consumption is framed and understood in the present work. Accordingly, emissions embedded within goods and services imported from abroad are included in the accounting. A review of the scenario planning literature is provided, an investigation is conducted into the epistemological contribution that these scenarios might make, and the methodology adopted for this study is described, before the scenarios themselves are laid out. Key lessons from the scenarios are discussed, including: the importance of a coordinated international approach (if households are to be expected to engage proactively in environmental behaviour-change); the increasing dominance of embedded emissions in imports (as a share of total household emissions) in the event of significant decarbonisation in the UK; the centrality of social movements in driving political outcomes either for or against a low carbon transition; and the economic impact of energy and resource depletion and the divergence of subsequent responses according to the socio-political uncertainties used to frame these scenarios.",1805170181,,Dissertations & Theses," Milne, ScottMilneScottMilne, Scott",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4120674551 , 106527902 , 189128 , 9781339888118 , 10130999 , 10130999", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781339888118, English, English,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1805170181?accountid=14496," 0438 Environmental economics , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0791 Energy"," 0438 Environmental economics , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0791 Energy"," 0438 Environmental economics , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0791 Energy",," 0438 Environmental economics , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0791 Energy"," Environmental economics , Environmental Studies , Energy"," (UMI)AAI10130999 , Social sciences , Applied sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Energy consumption",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Carbon+intensity+of+UK+household+consumption+%3A+Scenarios+to+2030&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Milne%2C+Scott&amp;isbn=9781339888118&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Role of the Imagined Worlds of Narrative in Social Change in Kenya: Exploring narrative consumption tendencies amongst youth in urban Nairobi and their interaction with fictional texts geared at altering health behaviour,"This research paper in a manifestation of my interest in the mechanisms of imagined worlds of narrative to bring about progressive social change, in the context of global flows of contemporary media movements. I begin with an exploration of the theoretical aspects of narrative and its creation of imagined worlds, specifically those of morality, tradition and the self. All these themes pertain to the reception of the main case study being investigated, a television mini-series shot and broadcast in Kenya called Shuga . Targeted at urban youth in Kenya, the show aimed to inculcate certain conscious health behaviours surrounding the HIV-AIDS disease through fictional narrative. From the results of surveys and interviews with 160 students at two major university institutions in Kenya, I gauge what sort of television programming consumption habits are prevalent amongst this community, as a basis for evaluating the success of Shuga in changing certain attitudes and behaviours. I briefly touch on the specificity of television as a deliverer of narrative, and comment on the predominant affiliation of Kenyan youth with the ‘global black’ phenomenon. The narratives in the show, and those of its watchers, form an important component of the ethos of this paper.

The second chapter is an overview of privatization on public administration. First, an overview of the concept of privatization of public administration and its boundary, Privatization is a broad point of view. From the broad sense ,it means that civil society organizations perform administrative tasks and involve in the provision of public services and the sum of all the ways. Then introduced the background and reasons for privatization, re-classified from a different angle, Privatization can be divided according to the strength of the market level of participation in public affairs, and it also can be divided according to the size of scope of private participation in the performing government functions. The final section describes the pattern of foreign public administration, classification and characteristics of privatization. Chapter III illustrates the impact of privatization on administrative law. Although the privatization rescued the government, improved administrative efficiency and better meet the needs of the people on public goods and public service needs, but had an impact on the administrative law.

The civilian education movement, which was proposed and spread by Yan Yangchu, the outstanding representative of these patriotic intellectual, has profound influence of the reality, forms systematic theory, and brings home to the issues of the times, like social problems and rural transformation. And above all, it still has profound significance of reality. In that case, under the guidance of tutor, the author conducts the further research on the philosophy value of Yan's commoner education thought. This paper is divided into three parts: First, what was the origin of Yan's education thought? Under the form background of commoner education thought, this paper studies the thought's theoretical and realistic source. The thought, which was produced in the May 4 movement later, matured in the experiment, which was conducted in Ding County of Hebei province in 1930's, and extended to all over the world in the mid-twentieth century, has far-reaching impact on the international country building. The origins of this thought contain the most famous people-oriented thought of Confucianism, the Chinese Christian thought, even the theory ""Newman said"" of Liang Qichao. On the other hand, the realistic resource was generated from the consideration to the Chinese laborers abroad. Therefore, under the impact of these factors, this China's unique educational ideological system was finally completed through 11 years' country building practice in Ding County of Hebei province. Second, on one hand, this paper sketched the Yan's commoner education thought, on the other hand, it also analyses the core content of the thought. It has the target of education, content of education, styles of education, and the ten creeds of county building movement, which was proposed in Yan's old age.

In this context, to provide high-quality urban living environment, to develop the eco-industry and technology becomes an important part of competition between cities. Besides,as the strategy of sustainable development was proposed with the united nations conference on ""environment and development"" in 1992, urban's coordinated development of natural and social ecosystem becomes an inevitable demand and preconditions for a city to participated in international and regional competition. It means that ""eco-city"" development and competition has become the trend and demands. It is urgent for cities to discuss how to strengthen their competitiveness scientifically and sustainablly. Zengcheng, which is located in the eastern section of Guangzhou city, efforts to exploit a scientific development mode in recent years. It gradually formed the population, economy, resources, environment, development pattern in harmony, sustainable development-oriented. The ""Zengcheng mode"" is now taking shape. In the future in the increasingly fierce competition between cities, it's worthy to discuss and study what Zengcheng should do to enhance its competitiveness continually in order to achieve leapfrog development. Since the 90's in 20th century, the city competition theory had been developing in China rapidly, and the research of this theory is still hot until now, however, in many studies, the study of the competitiveness of city in the ecological perspective is still rare. And most research of city competitiveness takes the ""ecological"" as a support, tend to understand ""ecological"" as ecological environment, lack of the ecology as system, process and purpose. This article aims to study the city competitiveness systems ecological and sustainable, based on the systems theory, ecology theory, competition theory and other theories, a systematic research in the concept and connotation of the urban competition and competitiveness on the ecological perspective. Based on this theoretical basis, for further construction of the eco-system perspective model of urban competitiveness combining with theoretical models and available data, using AHP to determine the ecological perspective of city competitiveness evaluation index system and evaluation model; under the perspective of ecology, from 2005 to 2008 the city competitiveness and SWOT analysis of the dynamic comparative analysis, the result showed that the overall city competitiveness score rise during this period. This city's comparative advantage mainly excels in the natural ecological competiveness and the social ecology movement, which both shows Zengcheng has a strong resource endowments advantages and great potential for social and ecological development. Its comparative disadvantage is on social and ecological basis of competitiveness and the natural ecological cycling, shows that Zengcheng gets weak social and ecological basis. In the natural environment, the powerful resource endowment advantage should be further transformed into a competitive advantage for increasing the industrial area south of the city, the natural ecological cycle has yet to improve sustainability.

In this course, different interest groups: government,merchants, residents in the community and the strangers, become the shaping forces of social structure and they challenge the principle of the residents of the community. Respectively, the land, the house and the job become the focus of the conflict. Today, we pay more attention to the transformation of the society. Most of the scholars concentrate on the economic rationality of the peasants and the dissolution of the community, however, the self-protection of the residents especially the resistance for the community and ""place"" received less attention. Based on the fieldwork, this article made the H village combined as the observing object, and then analyzed and explained the process of the construction of the ""village community"" in the rich rural areas. So, what we need to talk about is, under the shock of the market, how to make the construction of the ""village community"" be possible? What's the social basis for the peaceful resistance of the community members? And what is the operation of the logic and the value? To solve these above problems, this paper is divided into six parts. Chapter I presents the introduction, consciousness of the questions, review of the domestic and international community theory, and explains the theoretical framework and research methods. Chapter II explains the background and the current situation of the combination the villages and presents the main outline and the basic characteristics of the structure type of the village. Chapter III to The Chapter V, analyzes the action of the villagers in the market process of the land, houses and job, explains that the residents fought with the organization of the village and exclude the strangers of the community through (1)seeking ""legitimacy"" on boundary of the community, exclusivity and member right with local knowledge, (2) taking the peaceful resistance including spreading rumors, taking collective bargaining, complaining and so on to preserve their rights in the land market, their private feeling of the house, the priority of the job and so on, (3)then by these practices the members of the community reconstructed the network and the social system of the community, expressed the idea of justice and achieved the sense of security, certainty, and finally they maintained their ""community"" which emphasizes subjectivity, value, practice and experience. Chapter VI are the conclusions, this paper think that the openness of the economic boundary and the closeness of the social boundary is an interactive process and is a form of ""interactive movement"".

It is based on three shortcomings of given literature. First, classic sociology explained how nationalism rose as a whole, but could not explain why it varied with time and space. Second, while researches on new nationalism under socialist regimes largely focus on popular social movement and official diplomacy, they rarely noticed how socialist elite built nation states. Third, while sociology of state described how international competitions affected the formation of states, they neglect the recognition of elite by just regarding it as biological reaction to structural changes. When it comes to dependable variables, based on the 'universalism-particularism' framework founded by Greenfield, this article described four ideal types of nationalism: technology-ideology, technology-tradition, system-ideology and system-tradition nationalism. When it comes to explanation, this paper constructed the 'competition-recognition' model, explaining the variation within nationalism by the interaction between international competitions and elite recognition. In conclusion, with the competitiveness of classic system being weaken, technology-ideology nationalism tended to disappear, while different recognition of elite would lead to three other types of state nationalism.

With the in-depth implementation of political democratization, many newly established parties began to resort to democratic socialism as their ideology and so did some of the former parties. So far, 19 parties have become the full member of Socialist International. Socialist Parties' political influence in Sub-Saharan African countries keeps strengthening but not all these parties hold the same position in the political picture of every country, embodying an imbalance of the development. In this paper the author first presents a whole picture of the development of these parties and lays emphasis on quantifying their status based on electoral data. And then the author divides 19 parties into five categories according to the origin of the parties and the changes of their political strength. These five categories include the long-ruling parties and the opposition parties out of power after transformation, parties winning the election and the opposition parties losing the election after foundation, and several other socialist parties with strong influence in their own countries. On the basis of the categorization, an analysis is carried out on some typical parties, such as Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola, Social Democratic Front in Cameroon, the African National Congress, Mauritius Labor Party and the Mauritian Militant Movement, in order to conduct a concrete research in the following aspects: the developing process, party activities and electoral situation. After the overview and intensive analysis, those factors that result in the imbalanced development of the socialist parties in Sub-Saharan Africa are discussed little by little; the co-existence of dominant and competitive party system provides the political platform for the imbalanced development of the parties; malformed colonial economy and the social class structure on it inhibit the development of socialist parties; the contrast of religious of powers affects the public choice about the parties; different solutions to tribalism brings different political consequences; diplomatic relations in post-colonial era propose new challenges to the development of socialist parties.

After the ""the Sun Shines on the Sanggan River"" written by Ding Ling and ""Tempest"" written by Zhou Libo won the Stalin Prize, ""the Affection of Flesh and Blood"" is the third international literary awards. But five years ago, the author Hu Wanchun was still a worker amateur writer who couldn't even write a traditional word ""pig"". In 1950-1960s, we can tell that Hu is the envy of literary legends. Hu Wanchun, as the working-class spokesperson, has once brought a plain flavor of life to literary, and a fresh energy to the full of formulation of literary creation. However, Hu becomes an outdated scenery in history of literature, because of the theme of literary creation pasteurizing, drawing narrowing, and skill simplification. In that time, ""Hu Wanchun phenomenon"" is a very typical cultural phenomenon, which had hidden the historical connotation. That regards of many factors of the particular time of social, political, economic and culture, and so on. This thesis bases on previous comments and adopts study of cultural criticism perspective, and takes the ""Hu Wanchun phenomenon"" in 1950-1960s as a special social and cultural text to be interpreted. The discourse mainly consists of two aspects: The first aspect: ""the Myth""-An Era of the Worker Writer Legend Life. As a worker writer in 1950-1960s, Hu has become a literary legend due to more contemporary environment than his personal literary potential. As Shanghai vigorously develop the workers arts movement, the state system and numerous art workers pay a lot of hard working, the ""semiliterate"" Hu becomes a worker writer. In addition to the external factors, Hu achieving the extraordinary achievement in literary creation, the key reason is still depend on his different life experience, literary talent and studious writing, and so on. In short, Hu in virtue of Shanghai's favorable climate in 1950-1960s, pluses personal literary qualifications and efforts to create a worker writer myth, in which Hu becomes a famous writer from ""semiliterate"" workers. The second aspect: ""Bright and Melancholy""-The epochal theme writing and personalized writing. Hu Wanchun's works basically can be divided into two subjects: epochal theme writing and personalized writing. As a worker, Hu has simple working-class sense and the feeling of the master of new china. His works describe the Shanghai workers' life and full of workers life breath. His works describe the workers life full of passion, showing the working-class guileless aesthetic emotion and value orientation. These works correspond to the era theme and show that Hu is politically aware of to be a spokesman of CCP. On the other hand, as a writer, Hu has to write the ordinary life and common emotion due to his exquisite emotional and sentimental feeling. And this kind of works can highlight the Hu's special literary talent. In 1950-1960s, Hu Wanchun is difficult to get rid of the historical limitation such as stereotyped theme and simplified techniques, as the same with other contemporary worker writers. No matter how the emergence of worker writers is exciting, had once how energetic, Hu had never free from the literature as a kind of political means. Thus, Hu Wanchun is bond to be forgotten in history of literature, and finally becomes the lost scenery as time goes",1874384599,,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, WeiChenWeiChen, Wei",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318623581 , 111160162 , 189128 , 10572492 , 10572492", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874384599?accountid=14496, 0305 Asian literature, 0305 Asian literature, 0305 Asian literature,, 0305 Asian literature, Asian literature," (UMI)AAI10572492 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+lost+scenery--a+discussion+about+1950-1960s%27+worker+writer+hu+wangchun&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Wei&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The research 0n ecological ethics education in china with the view of comprehensive human development,"Translation from original language as provided by author Centuries after the Industrial Revolution, the ecological environment is deteriorating continuously which has brought a huge threat to people's production and life, and also led to serious global crisis in ecological and living.

As to the machine tooling production line, the average lead time of the product has been decreased by 52%.The movement distance for the materials has been shortened by 41.9%, the number of operators has been cut down by 40%. The flexible improvement project for the production line has achieved fantastic effect. A lot of problems in GOEC have been resolved by this project, such as the limited production area, the numerous types for the product, the speed of product renewal, the variable customer requirements, and the great increase of the customer requirement and so on. The operation cost of the GOEC has been decreased as well. Although the quality of the product from different enterprises becomes similar and the product price is continuously dropping down, the profit of GOEC is still increasing in the intense competition environment by the flexible improvement in the production line. GOEC has become strong enough to face the drastic market competition. Finally, the successful application experience of using the value stream mapping tool to improve the production line has been summarized in this thesis.

While other Western European countries have recognized the conception of intellectual property, German artist, trademark Owner and inventor have no right to take the intellectual property as acknowledged Legal conceptualism in the field of German private law. As an Important system form in present Property domain, German intellectual property system has gone through a long process of gestation, generation, development and perfection, and it is the product of combined effects of various social conditions. History is a mirror. Many aspects of modern intellectual property law can only be better explained through the lens of history, based on past and present reasons. Therefore, the concept of intellectual property rights will be the starting point of this paper, according to the description and analysis of historical background, theoretical basis, legislative history and international protection. We grasp the development pulse of German intellectual property system, and borrow beneficial ideas for Chinese construction of the contemporary intellectual property theory and practice of the system. The basic structure is as follows: Introduction: a brief overview of the author's writing intention, and a clear grasp of the importance of development pulse of German intellectual property system Chapter One: describe the dispute in German academic circles induced by the concept of German intellectual property, and systematically interpret it, according to comparative studying on the relevant laws and regulations in the public and private law field.

Put emphasis on the basic content and legal status of intellectual property from both industrial property right and literary property. Chapter Three: Mainly introduce and comment the privilege system in the details, which is the historical origin of German intellectual property. At the same time, the policy of privilege system has promoted the prosperity and development of local business and the development process of intellectual property system in addition. Thereby privilege system cannot simply be regarded as the precursor of copyright law. The underlying purpose of privilege system is not to maintain the benefit of the author, inventor or other craftsmanship owner, but the benefit of privilege enlightenment countries in the 18th century. Chapter Four: Spell out the theoretical foundation of intellectual property system. Firstly, the liberal political economic theory, which opened the early beginning of liberal thought. The goal of national public administration is not only the simple public welfare, but also the protection and realization of individual rights. Secondly, natural law theory and legal philosophy of personality rights, which makes possible the continuation of the personality rights bill for the original human rights. Strictly distinguish between personal rights and indigenous rights in the content. At last, describe the Locker's property labor theory. Chapter Five: describe the legislative history and legislative trends of intellectual property mainly from three aspects, which are the copyright law, patent law and trademark law, according to the needs and difficulties encountered in the legislative proceeding of intellectual property. Chapter Six: depict the situation of international protection for German intellectual property, form the aspects of bilateral agreement, Paris Convention, Berne Convention, Universal Copyright Convention and the international reform movement after World War Two respectively.

First, with the community of Paris making the socialism transformed from fantasy to reality, although it had gained many experiences, what it left more was the lesson and the defeat of the community of Paris caused the International Communist Movement to fall into the ebb tide; Second, the Russian Revolution opened a new angle to study socialism. When the West International Communist Movement fell into the ebb tide temporarily, in Russia, the interwoven domestic and foreign contradictions caused it to march to the revolutionary eve. Then this article has analyzed the creation origin of Marx's East society theory. It thinks that its origin had three reasons. First, it summarized the lessons of community of Paris and answered the question of the allied forces of the proletariat revolution; Second, the capitalism changed from the time of monopoly to the time of free competition and thus it welcome the capitalism to develop steadily and this requested Marx to ponder the socialist revolution from the supplementary angle of the East and the West; Third, it explained the difficulty of Russian Revolution and sought the path of the East socialist revolution. Afterwards, it described the formation process of his Eastern society theory from ""the Asia production method"" to ""the community of villages"" and again to ""the note of anthropology"" In the primary coverage of Marx's Eastern society theory, the author has first elaborated the general social laws in ancient China and from the vicissitude of the ownership system and the slow development of the society and the cultural characteristics of ""family, country, world"" in ancient times, it reached the conclusion that until now, the social development, although it already got rid of the Asia production method, it is influenced deeply by the Asia production method, and this belongs the study category of Marx's Eastern society. Next, it introduced Marx's research evolution of the Asia production method. And then it starts to recognize the ideas of that the Eastern society is the primitive society and it has the private ownership and the history Eastern and Western is the double profession but non-one-way street. It then has studied the duality analysis of Marx about Russian community of villages thus draws out the hypothesis and proves of ""the spanning canyon"". Finally it has elaborated the researches and the explorations of Communist Party of China on Marx's East society theory under the different historical situation in time of the New Democratic Revolution and in time of the reform and open policy and in time of constructing the harmonious society under the scientific development",1874458919,,Dissertations & Theses," Ye, Qian HuaYeHuaQianYe, Qian Hua",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318790561 , 111166032 , 189128 , 10501948 , 10501948", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874458919?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAI10501948 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+research+of+marx%27s+theory+on+east+society&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ye%2C+Qian+Hua&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The debate of constitutionalism main idea and the choice of national systems in preparation constitutionalism,"Translation from original language as provided by author After the Opium War, China's social formation had been transferred into a semi-feudal society from the closed small-scale peasant society, the loss of territory and sovereignty and the various domestic and oversee conflicts forced the Chinese community to face the transformation phase from the traditional feudal society to a modern capitalist society. The profound lessons of lagging behind and being attacked makes the whole country angry so much, the people come from different hierarchy were looking forward to learn advanced technology and the social system from the West, in order to make the country rich and army stronger. However, different social hierarchy had the different attitudes and purposes toward the Political Reform movement. First of all, as the ruling class,the Qing government also hopes to realize the purpose to achieve prosperity,however, as a stubborn conservative representative of the feudal forces, the Qing government did not want to change the absolute monarchy, only hope to conduct the constitutional political reform to temporarily relieve the domestic and international conflicts; Secondly, active intellectuals were learning form advanced Western countries who really wanted to save the country's future, hope to utilize the political reform and modify the Laws, and establish the constitutional government to push China to the road of prosperity. intellectuals in different periods presented a variety of ideas by analyzing and comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various social and political systems, and connected with Chinese national conditions, which were even generated fierce conflicts, but it is just the concept by integration and impacting, made the ideas of this period very active, Constitutional thought and the legal system has been spread widely and deeply. This period is the enlightenment of the political and legal thoughts which influenced the legal development so much. This thesis based on this particular preparatory constitutional period, focus on the theme of constitutional government, describe the innovation of constitutional system and constitutional thought made by Chinese community. The traditional Chinese legal thinking lasted for thousands years concept,which is based on the patriarchal family-based thought combined with etiquette and supremacy autocratic monarchical power ,, but with the development of China's capitalist economy, and foreign invasion forced Chinese into the world capitalist system, the traditional legal ideas and systems could not adapt to new social demand. Under pressure of community and in order to adapt to Chinese society to explore new political and legal system, the Qing government made some effective attempts, such as the promulgation of China's first modern constitutional document-- ""Outline Imperial Constitution""; set up the advisory council and the Conference Board as the predecessor of Parliament; set up new school to conduct the legal education; reformed the government in accordance with the principle of separation of the legislative, executive, judicial rights; implemented the local autonomy. However, due to that Qing government did not really want to establish the constitutional government, these measures to reform the country ultimately became a mere formality, and not really effectively implemented. Compared to the systems innovation, the spread constitutional thought in the period of preparing of the constitutional has a more far-reaching significance in society when the dominant thought is the Constitutional Thought represented by,Kang, Liang reformers, they advocated to limit the monarchy power, establish the constitutional monarchy countries; abolish imperial examination system and set up new schools; advocated the establishment of the chamber and the implementation of local self-government; to promote the rule of law, promote civil rights.

The nature of capital is constantly on the creation of surplus value and the aim of capital movement is to achieve value procedures. Under the background of production socialization, through various forms the scattered, independent, single existing private capital and individual capital become intensive, united and shared social capital, which means the public can share the common ownership and the right of social capital.

In recent decades more attention has been put on defining the legal channels of entry, residence and employment, categorizing migrants as people who are either legally or illegally within a country. Stretched out into the Mediterranean Sea, Italy has found itself with a significant number of irregular migrants living within its borders. Viewed within international circles for its increasingly controversial policies, Italy's approaches towards irregular migration have generated widespread debate. The means of acquiring legal status have been disputed as immigration policies have progressively become more repressive. The reality that remains forms the foundation for this research. The objective of this study was to develop a better understanding of how to solve the problems associated with Italy's immigration policy within the scope of irregular migration of those who migrate for economic purposes. In order to accomplish this, it is necessary to discover where the problems lie. By clarifying the ways in which policy has developed within the realm of its influences, investigating implementation practices in several areas of authority, exploring outcomes of the policy and looking at how they have taken shape in society, and considering possible solutions for policy facilitation and change, this study has thoroughly explored this phenomenon. This research tries to answer three groups of questions: (1) What elements have contributed to the challenges of controlling irregular migration in Italy? (2) What consequences have these components brought upon migrants? And how? (3) What changes in Italy's immigration policy could be implemented to sustain legal migration and actively discourage irregular migration? Approaching the research with a first-hand look has added a distinct dimension to this study. Fieldwork was carried throughout the summer of 2010 in Italy to gain a more intimate perspective on the current situation. Discussing irregular migration not only with those who work with the phenomenon, but live in its reality, offered deeper insight to the issues that have been onset by the policy, and provided a sobering look into its human impacts. Observations and interview data collected were made use of to clarify the patterns and trends that emerged. Documentation and data sources were included in order to solidify the evidence that was found. Empirical evidence within the findings, verified by supportive documents and sources has indicated a combination of political, legal, administrative practices as the elements that have made irregular migration in Italy difficult to control. Political influence presiding over policy-making has generated political support for curbing irregular migration. The political agenda frames migrants as a security threat, which has led to a negative portrayal of migrants and irregular migrants and consequently difficulties in integration within society and lack of social participation within the community. Restrictive legislation evolvement towards migration as a whole has caused significant reduction of legal channels for economic and social participation; therefore, there is the inclination to depend on those involved with the underground economy and/or illegal activity as a means of survival. Improvements to Italy's immigration policy are offered in the context of looking at examples from Canada, Germany and the United States. Lessons drawn from these examples include: shifts in political approach, stronger legislation towards fighting human trafficking, modifications in administrative personnel, and increasing the amount of legal channels accessible to irregular migrants. All of these suggestions could positively enhance future immigration policy in",1874854890,,Dissertations & Theses," Tan, Kai TianTanTianKaiTan, Kai Tian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319127271 , 111162102 , 189128 , 10514293 , 10514293", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874854890?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," (UMI)AAI10514293 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Irregular+migration+in+italy%3A+exploring+the+changes%2C+consequences%2C+and+improvements+of+policy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tan%2C+Kai+Tian&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"On the development and apocalyps of the european green party,"Translation from original language as provided by author Since human society paced into the industrialized time productivity expanded rapidly.

As productivity expanded, industrial pollution, nuclear waste, imbalanced ecology attracts more and more attention. Part of the public in the developed countries has doubts about the capitalist product system. They thought that the capitalist system chasing market and profit ignored the ecology and environment, and quest a new way to change the entire society into a new one which fits the ecology.

Many historians still view entertainment as frills rather than the substance of culture reorientation. However, for the urban resident, leisure life in the early years of the twentieth century came to include more than entertainment; it became a public social life outside the cloistered walls of home and business, and it brought diverse elements of the urban landscape into the same social arena. The evolution of leisure life and amusement institutions forms the critical element in the changing of ideology and society from 1900 to 1924. There appears obvious periodalization according to the survey of amusement advertisements in Shen Daily and News Daily. Most historians see the thirties as a culmination and look the twenties as a beginning. But this is not true. We should rather view the twenties as a culmination and should not ignore the function of Late Qing Empire in the development of popular culture. The growth of public leisure life starting in the Late Qing Empire accompanied the decline of Confucianism. Many changes in leisure life institutions and entertainment over the course of the first twenties years of the twentieth century mirrored the transformation of social and cultural attitudes and behavior. Progressive and conservative critics tried to uplift the New Drama as a tool of education. When the New Drama was commercialized and changed into Wenming Xi, they began to attack it. To their tastes, Wenming Xi was too informal and too relaxed, exercising little control over the personality and care little about the nationalism. They wanted pubic life to refine individual character and mirror the prospect of the nation/state. The struggle between popular culture and high culture (or mass culture and elite culture), and the emergence of cultural hierarchy after the New Culture Movement, are crucial to understanding why Wenming Xi lost its reputation. There are no real boundaries between popular culture study and intellectual studies. As Professor Thomas Bender pointed out, ""it is only when that internal history is brought into relations with external contingencies, including place, economy, social relations, and politics, that one begins to write an urban history of culture."" In the field of cultural history, the divide between popular culture and high culture is sharper and sharper. However, in the book Highbrow/lowbrow: The Emergence of Culture Hierarchy in American, the author assays that high culture cannot be adequately studied outside the complex patterns of relation to more popular forms of culture, what's more, high and popular, sacralized and commercial, elite and more general culture forms are deeply entangled with each other in ways that mutually define them and that establish their metropolitan identity and role. Wenming Xi is a perfect case that puts lots of importmant issues together. Amusement transferred from a private activity to a public event at the beginning of the twentieth century. Looking after their serious matters during the daytime, people enjoyed the city's pleasures during the evening. They brought their culture to the public, and then they returned home taking part of the city with them. Different culture mixed together in those public spaces and a new form of culture came into being. The restrictions placed on individuals were lessened. Greater emphasis was placed on self-fulfillment, self-expression rather the responsibility to state/nation. To define Wenming Xi is not easy. Until today, there is no accurate definition or a suitable evaluation about it. If we examine it from an approach of transnational history, we find that Wenming Xi is the voice of city, and the voice of modernity. Generally, this dissertation will mainly focus on three issues. The first, contrary to many researchers who look on Wenming Xi as the origin of Chinese Modern Drama and emphasize their relationship, this essay will explore its relationship with movie. The second, in the approach of social and cultural history, comparative history, we will study Wenming Xi in a more wide perspective and break the boundary of Japan-Chinese frame. The third, the flourishing of Wenming Xi was due to the development of women culture. Through examing the relation between them, we can survey issues about",1874915632,,Dissertations & Theses," Lin, Cun XiuLinXiuCunLin, Cun Xiu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319285801 , 111167892 , 189128 , 10551031 , 10551031", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874915632?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10551031 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+voice+of+the+city%3A+wenming+xi+and+urban+culture+in+early+twenty+century+shanghai&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lin%2C+Cun+Xiu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A study on the fluctuation of the wheat price in china,"Translation from original language as provided by author International grain price rose sharply again in the end of 2010,causing great concern around the world. This great concern is closely related to the worldwide grain crisis broking out in 2008, for which many people are still lingering fear. The worldwide food crisis in 2008 led to riots even the coups in many developing countries.The abnormal fluctuation of the international grain price made every country begin to pay more attention to the grain problem. China has many grain varieties and the grain problem is more complex, so this paper only selects wheat as a starting point. Wheat is one of China's major grain crops and has been a major national protection species, perennial plantings and production of which separately accounts for 25% and 22% of the total grain. Fluctuation of the wheat price has been the focus of national grain policy and wheat price will be involved in almost every reform of the grain price. Although the chain of wheat industry is relatively simple and the fluctuation of price is not as sharp as the price of soybean and corn, with the gradual reform of the grain market, the price fluctuation of wheat is gradually showing more and more obvious cycle. This paper studies the fluctuation of wheat price and the three main efforts are as following: firstly, sort out the wheat price policies in China since 1949.secondly, analyze the characteristics of wheat price fluctuation, including long-term trend and cyclical fluctuation around the long-term trend, using time series decomposition method and the monthly data of wheat from January 1998 to February 2011. And finally, empirically study the impact of the three factors of production cost, international wheat price and expectation on domestic wheat price, using the sample data from January 2002 to February 2011 and the distributed lag model. The study on the characteristics of the wheat price fluctuation gives the following conclusions: (1) The fluctuation of the real wheat price is higher than the nominal after 2004. (2) The movement of the seasonally adjusted price sequence of wheat is consistent with the original sequence, so the seasonal impact on the wheat price does not exist or is minimal. (3) A long-term rising trend of the wheat price exists since 1998, which is due to China's economic development,population growth,improvement of living standard and consumption,adjustment of diet structure,rising of the agricultural production cost,inflation and many other factors. This long-term rising trend of wheat price is in line with general law of the economic and social development. (4) There is a short-term fluctuation of wheat price around the long-term trend from January 1998 to February 2011 and the short-term fluctuation can be divided into five periods, the average length of 30 months. With the deepening of grain market reform, the fluctuation is getting more and more severe. National policy has a certain control action for the fluctuation of the wheat price, but when government strengthens the control of wheat market, the period of fluctuation will be abnormally extended. (5) Domestic wheat price lags behind international wheat price, and there is a lag period of up to 10 months from international peak to domestic peak. The empirical study on the impact of the three factors of production cost, international wheat price and expectation on domestic wheat price gives the following conclusions: (1) Production cost has a strong positive impact on domestic wheat price, which is also the main reason of the long-term rising trend. (2) Current international wheat price has no effect on domestic wheat price and the international wheat price lagged one has very small negative impact on the domestic wheat prices, which is due to the fact that the domestic wheat market is relatively independent on the international wheat market. As mentioned above, domestic wheat price lags behind international price, so the result from the empirical research shows a negative correlation that when the international wheat price is up, domestic wheat price is down. (3) Expectation represented by the domestic wheat price index lagged one affects the domestic wheat price",1874915692,,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, Xiu LanChenLanXiuChen, Xiu Lan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319286711 , 111167922 , 189128 , 10545958 , 10545958", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874915692?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned,, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10545958 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+on+the+fluctuation+of+the+wheat+price+in+china&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Xiu+Lan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Tentative discussion of the prosperity and development of chinese marxist historiography in yan'an area during the war of resistance,"Translation from original language as provided by author The generation, development and spread of Chinese Marxist historiography is an indispensable cultural support to the revolutionary career of the Communist Party of China and China's socialist construction. During the war of resistance, Marxist historiography in Yan'an area gradually gained in strength and echoed with Marxist historiography mainly concentrated in areas ruled by Kuomintang with the encouragement and the meticulous guidance from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. They together became the important arteries and veins of Chinese culture during the Anti-Japanese War, thus provided words of support and academic weapon for the Anti-Japanese War led by the Chinese Communist Party. It was no accident that Marxist historiography rose in Yan'an area during the war of resistance, for it both had historical causes and realistic reasons. It was not only influenced by Japanese Marxist historiography, especially by Stalin's Soviet Union's historiography directly or indirectly, but also inherited the tradition of the twenty-five histories in fact, and even had something similar to new schools and new ideas since ""the revolution in historiographic world"" called as non-Marxist historiography. The Marxist historiography should combat applied historiography and historical view of emperor, resist the retro trend of the nationalists and settle internal disagreements among the communists. It was in response to the call of ""characterized Chinese scholarship movement"" and was the reflection of the international relationship in wartime, still was subordinate to the comprehensive construction of the new state apparatus from the red political power. Chinese Marxist historiography in Yan'an area during the war of resistance could not take shape or develop without the troika's favorable cooperation-the formation of the Marxist historians, the establishment and evolution of the historiographers' institute and the popularity of history education. In this period, Marxist historiography worker were devoted to the history field covering general history, intellectual history, specialism history, historical theory, historical philosophy and popular history. As a result, the researches involved were abroad and comprehensive, including social nature and historical rule, recent history and party history, history philosophy and ideology culture, peasant wars and the movements for workers and peasants, ethnic issues, international relations, history teaching and so on. Therefore, when combing the vein of Chinese Marxist historiography in Yan'an area during the war of resistance, we could also pick out its important features. The historians in Yan'an area differed from Chinese traditional and modern historians in Guidance theories, historical thinking, stylistic rules, usage of historical data,linguistic features, collection collaboration and so on. Besides, it inherited ethnic characteristics of Chinese historiography, absorbed scientific principles or laws of the Western historiography and carried forward party spirit principles of the Soviet Union. This paper is to draw a moral from Chinese Marxist historiography in Yan'an area during the war of resistance by serious probe and analysis, as well as providing references for the development of Chinese Marxist historiography under the guidance of the materialism of history, which can give effective play of its social function based on the national conditions in China in the face of the impact of the Neo-Confucianism, the Neo-Taoism, post-modern thinking, post-post modern thinking and many other Chinese and Western ideological trends of historiography.

In his many domestic and foreign policy, his regional alliance policy is most representative. Chavez's alliance policy is the one that is promoted around the construction and development of ALBA,it is a useful exploration for a new model of integration,whose ultimate goal is promoting the integration of the whole Latin-America through the alliance of partial countries.Chavez's alliance policies is reflected in the construction process of the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA), the background of the alliance's rising, guiding principles and developing vision reflect the Chavez's thinking for the new integrated model. Chavez pursue an independent foreign position, hoping to reach a new level of regional alliance through various means, thus promoting to all countries of the Alliance's economic and social development. Chavez create a new way to mutual cooperation for developing countries through bold attempt,and make us understand and knowledge the history and current situation of Latin America, and provides us a new perspective to see the complex political and economic situation. Nationalist ideology is the most widely used in the Latin American, it is derived from the history of popular resistance among European settlers. The frequent intervention and even armed invasion of the United States gives Latin American people a strong anti-American ideology. The Bolivarian called for Latin American countries to unit into a whole, fighting against external forces, it has also become the beginning of integrated thinking. The failure of neo-liberal reforms result in the rise of the Latin American left movement, but mostly leftist leaders have an independent sense, they also began to explore the road of integration independent of the United States. From the development process, the target vision, operating mechanism and the guiding principles, we can comprehensively review ALBA--a new coalition. Following Chavez's , ALBA member states gradually search for alternative development model of capitalism, but of course the core of this model is an left-wing coalition. In short,there are three main points which is used to promote the regional allinance policy: the establishment of an unity of high level in the areas independent of the U.S. alliance; efforts to explore the new model of the integration; the full use of three tools for integration;the ultimate goal of the economic and social development.Everything points to a higher goal--the integration of Latin-America. Chavez alliance policy in areas where there are many worthy of recognition , his exploration of new models of integration, and maintenance of the public interest, represents the expectation of the innovation of development model and promoting social progress. Because of Latin America's limited economic power, alliance, the absence of institutionalion and personal political behavior, Chávez's integration policy is faced with many challenges and risks, the future is",1874930658,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, Zhi YongLiYongZhiLi, Zhi Yong",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319342431 , 111185532 , 189128 , 10541049 , 10541049", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874930658?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAI10541049 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Research+on+chavez%27s+regional+alliances+policy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Zhi+Yong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Studies on modern lacquer body ornament design,"Translation from original language as provided by author As the global economy and society develop rapidly, human consumption of natural resources, manufacturing products being mass produced, mankind consumes natural resources without control.

It's in the early period of the founding of new China that the economy was been devastating and a thousand things needed to be done, our country must make a socialist transformation of agriculture, so the goverment advocated the policy, Agricultural cooperation. It is the only choice that we can make under that background. Shaanxi, as the region in which contduted the movement earlier, leart form the experience of other places, then combined the experience with its own practice, and developed its own identity in the process of the Agricultural cooperation movement finally. Although there were some mistakes, yet it really made a great progress on agricutule at that time. Therefore, the movement did some work. This article mainly based on the backgroud of China in the 1950s. Fist of all,it had a review of the backgroud of the development of the Agricultural Cooperation in Shannxi from both the international set and domestic set to argue the necessity of its rise. Further, after consulting many reference materials, the article sorted out the development process of the agriculture cooperation movemnt in Shannxi, and researched its operating system to demonstrate it from the allover perspective.

Many of CPC's decisions and strategies were inextricably linked with him in this period. Therefore, to study and discuss Bo Gu's Political Thoughts from 1931 to 1935 is necessary for in-depth understanding of the Communist Party in this period. Because of the wrong advice from the Communist International and strong ""left"" climate in the Chinese Communist Party, Bo Gu continued to run Wang Ming's ""left"" dogmatism errors and even pushed it forward during the period when he took overall responsibility in the Chinese Communist Party. He made some wrong ideas in some of the basic issues, for example, in the analysis of class relations and tendencies within the party, which restricted the development of the Chinese revolution to some extent. Bo Gu thinked middle forces such as the bourgeois were the ""most dangerous enemies"" in the analysis of class relations. And, as to the tendency within the party, he thinked they should ""accumulate all firepower and fight against the right opportunism, the major crisis"". In dialectical view, while Bo Gu made a number of ""left"" claims, he still did a useful exploration in issues related to the revolution with a strong zeal of revolution. He also put forward some positive views in the mobilization of the public, leading the student movement, strengthening the military's political work and other aspects. He believed that they should ""alert"" and mobilize the public positively and lead the student movement with ""firm and strong leadership"" .What's more, he called for strengthening the ""political work in the company"", and reinforcing organization building in the party and army. Associated with the complex circumstances of the struggle in the period, Bo Gu's political thought was a complex synthesis when he took overall responsibility in the Chinese Communist Party. In the form, he believed in Communist dogma in one side, and also thinked with practice and tried to be creative. In content, it can be described as the coexistence of right and wrong, and the error dominated relatively. The reasons why Bo Gu's political thoughts showed the coexistence of right and wrong are the complex social factors by the time. These factors included: the edification of the ""left"" atmosphere, the guidance of the Communist International and the gradual maturity of the CPC, remote control and constraints from Wang Ming, Bo Gu's personality and personal experience. By the study of Bo Gu's political thoughts from 1931 to 1935 when he took overall responsibility in the Chinese Communist Party, we are more in-depth understanding of the positive sides of Bo Gu's political thoughts, and the generation of ""left"" mistakes was not entirely the responsibility of Bo Gu. More important, basing on objective analysis of the historical background is the basic attitude in the study and evaluation of Bo Gu's political thoughts when he took overall responsibility in the Chinese Communist Party from 1931 to",1874977662,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, Zhao JieWangJieZhaoWang, Zhao Jie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319468671 , 111160502 , 189128 , 10544621 , 10544621", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874977662?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAI10544621 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+first+exploration+on+bo+gu%27s+political+thoughts+while+assuming+overall+responsibility+in+the+cpc&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Zhao+Jie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Research on the dissemination of marxism by shen dingyi's early period,"Translation from original language as provided by author After the October Revolution, the progressive intellectuals in China started to pay attention to Marxism which conducted the October Revolution to success. The diplomatic failure of China in the ""Paris Peace Conference"" and the outbreak of the May Fourth Movement, made Chinese progressive intellectuals themselves recognize the disadvantages of capitalism, and disappoint at the powerful nature of capitalism. It also encouraged them to shift their attention to Marxism further. At one point, it was prevailing to learn, study and dissemination Marxism, henceforth a group of communism-oriented intellectuals came on the scene, of which Shen Dingyi is one member. This paper intends to discuss Shen's contribution to the dissemination of Marxism, which can be divided into three sections. Section One will be devoted to showing the primary motive of Shen Dingyi's dissemination of Marxism. Both subjective and objective elements cause him to advocate Marxism. From the objective perspective, Shen pursued the way to change China due to the dark social reality in China, precisely because of the repeated failure of his pursuit, he finally focused on Marxism, which is the domestic element of his dissemination of Marxism. Besides, the victory of the October Revolution and the friendly policies towards China taking by Soviet Russia are the international element. From the subjective perspective, the enlightenment caused by the New Cultural Movement made Shen's thought more and more radical, which spiritually, prepared for Shen's acception and dissemination of Marxism ultimately. After participating in the foundation of the early organizations of CCP in Shanghai, via several discussions concerning the drafting of some relevant programs with the representatives from the Communist International and some Chinese progressive intellectuals, his knowledge of Marxism was deepened widely, which was the practical element of his acception and dissemination of Marxism. Section Two will be devoted to showing the main contents of his dissemination of Marxism. After the May 4th Movement, Shen started to concentrate on and inclined to Marxism, he also introduced some doctrines of Marxism. Untill October in 1920, when the Communist Manifesto translated by Chen Wangdao was published, Shen comprehended Marxism more profoundly and established his belief in Marxism eventually. Afterwards, he published a number of articles in Weekly Critic founded by himself , Consciousness as the supplement of Republican Daily edited by Shao Lizi, and Labor Realm which was the offical newspaper of the early organizations of CCP in Shanghai, introducing some relevant principles of Marxism, which mainly cover: Marxist historical materialism, which consists of the theses that social existence determines social ideology and that the mass is the creator of history; the theory of surplus value, which elaborates that labor creates value and the capitalists exploites the workers through possessing freely the surplus value created by the latter; class struggle, which analyses the necessity and principal means of class struggle ,and he started to diagnose problem in terms of the method of Marxist class analysis; the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat, which elucidates the necessity of the labor dictatorship and the thesis that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the ladder to a stateless society. Section Three will be devoted to showing the feature of Shen's dissemination of Marxism. He propagated Marxism in various channels and forms, broadened its influence in the mass, and endeavored to implant Marxism into the soil of China, which gave rise to the original bud of the chinization of Marxism. He also instructed and organized the peasant movement in the light of Marxist principles. Furthermore, he advocated Marxism in aruging with other ideas which reproached Marxism, through which he justified socialism, corrected those ideas which demonized socialism , refuted the viewpoint that socialism asserts the community of women proposed by opponents and retorted the assertion that argues against the labor dictatorship. Nevertheless, there are also inevitably some demerits in Shen's dissemination of Marxism, which are mainly embodied in the respect that the Marxism propagated by him is incomprehensive and inaccurate. Regarding this, on the one hand, we ought to admit the existence of those demerits; on the other hand, we are supposed to recognize that those demerits are greatly relative to the contemporary social background, hence we cannot blame these early propagators of that time. In addition, we should take a correct view of his subsequent regression, analyse objectively Shen in the manner of respecting the facts, rather than denying his contribution to the dissemination of Marxism merely on account of his regression, in order to disclose the real nature of",1874978019,,Dissertations & Theses," Chen, HongChenHongChen, Hong",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319468641 , 111160502 , 189128 , 10545539 , 10545539", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874978019?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," (UMI)AAI10545539 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Research+on+the+dissemination+of+marxism+by+shen+dingyi%27s+early+period&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chen%2C+Hong&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The construction of risk society in screen,"Translation from original language as provided by author As the byproducts or negative effects, ""Risk"" has accompanied with the human society through a long historical period. It reflects from a flank the historical changes in human society: Before the industrial society, ""earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, climate change"" and other natural risks constitute a major threat for production and life of human society; In the early industrial society, Man-made risks replaced the natural risks gradually and becoming the major obstacle to social development; The rise of the new technological revolution prompted some new risks ,which are not dependent on natural movement (such as the financial crisis, terrorism) to spread global. In the 21st century, a society characterized by the risk is coming. In order to grasp better the nature of modern society, Beck,Giddens and other sociologists proposed a new theory about ""risk society"" from the ""overall transition risk"" perspective. They define the global Man-made risks as the quality of the structure of contemporary society and the future society,reflect and critique this kind ""modernity "", which modeled on Western industrial society . As the ""mass"" vehicle of risk knowledge or risk information,screen continue to build a variety of topics related to risk and promote the ""Mediumlization"" of concept of risk. In the ""competition"" with other social organizations or groups, screen media also form their own expression on the ""risk"". As a parole of ""Risk"", screen played not only an important role in the process of risk's perception and expression ,and also reconstruct ""Risk"" in the media practice of ""perception and expression"". McLuhan believes that any kind of media technology, are the extension of human organs or sense. But I think that each extension of human organs or sense contains also the defects and shortcomings of the prototype--As the activities of human life requires the coordination of all human organs and sense, the balance of human communication need also coordination and cooperation of various kinds of ""extension"" (all medium). New risks and new problems which born in the media practice are not only the inherent defects of screen media, and also the manifestation of the contemporary risk's ""structural difficulties"". ""Extension"" of the human forms the basic pattern of modern media system, and study of Marxist philosophy believes that source of Risk in modern society is human's ""alienation"". Therefore, the reconstruction in screen of ""risk society"" is only a miniature of ""Risk Culture"". We have no need to fear for ""Risk Culture"", it is a modern civilization,which can accept the risks:It includes not only the meaning of destruction and negatives, and holds also the key of creation and affirmation. The remodeling of ""Risk Culture"" requires the human to re-examine the issue of contemporary Risk, develop a cross-disciplinary cooperation of whole society, all fields,",1874998384,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhou, XiangZhouXiangZhou, Xiang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319436041 , 70614202 , 189128 , 10497704 , 10497704", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874998384?accountid=14496, 0391 Journalism, 0391 Journalism, 0391 Journalism,, 0391 Journalism, Journalism," (UMI)AAI10497704 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+construction+of+risk+society+in+screen&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhou%2C+Xiang&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Study on cooperation in information organization between libraries and other institutions,"Translation from original language as provided by author In social networking environment, information plays an increasingly important role in people's studying, working and living. The ""information explosion"" brought by the development of the information technologies makes the information-organizing of great necessity. Meanwhile, there are more and more institutions which participate in the information organization from each point of view, such as libraries, presses, archives, museums, online-bookstores, search engines and so on. The information-organizing of multi-institutions reduces the workloads of information organization, however, causes some problems, such as duplication of effort, varied qualities and so on. Thus, it's very necessary to study the countermeasures of multi-institutions information organization. It is good for integrating information resources, improving the quality of information-organizing, optimizing resource allocation, and helps realizing the social value of information.Several familiar information institutions are studied, such as libraries, presses, archives, museums, Internet. The whole dissertation consists of seven parts, its main contents are as follows:The first chapter is introduction. Based on summarizing the research and practice of home and aboard, the author pointed out the research purpose and significance of this dissertation, and introduced the research contents, and some methods used in this dissertation.In the second chapter, the author analyses the necessity of multi-institutions information organization from three aspects of the expanding information quantity, the different aims of institutions, changeable information requirements. Three facts------common grounds of institutions, international and regional organizations, same codes and standards of information-organizing, provide feasibilities of multi-institutions information organizing.In the third chapter, the author elaborates the status of information-organizing by libraries and publishing organization. The concrete forms of cooperative information-organizing consist of editing CIP data, launching OA movement, exploiting metadata standards.In the fourth chapter, the author analyzes the theories and practices of information-organizing by libraries, archives and museums home and abroad. Some cooperative institutions are set up and some cooperative projects are launched abroad, of which the most famous are World Digital Library Project and Cornucopia Project. In China, scholars made theoretic study on the motivation and forms of cooperative information-organization. Libraries and archives carried out cooperation on digital reference and governance publicity.In the fifth chapter the author sums up a situation of information-organizing by libraries and Internet. Websites are divided into three types: search engine, book review sites and social network sites in this paper. The concrete forms of cooperative information-organizing are as follows: the search engine sites link to the book information of numerous libraries, libraries and book review sites exchange data, libraries promote and push resources and services with the help of social network sites.In the sixth chapter, several suggestions are given. It's the premise of cooperative information-organizing to set the same codes and standards. Interests-balancing guarantees smoothness of cooperative information-organizing. User-participated information organization contributes to accomplishing the aim of cooperative information-organizing.The last chapter summarizes the research of the dissertation, points out limitations of research, and puts forward the study plans for the near future research.This paper is a research result of Chinese philosophy and social science foundation (Project Name: Innovative Research on Theories and Methods of Information Organization in Social Networking Environment.

China's current ""Prison Law"" reflects the concept for the protection of criminals' rights and interests. However, there is still distance with the economic and social development and with the rule of law. There still exist many problems in the implementation of the legal system. As the awareness of protecting the rights and interests of the Criminal and the gradual maturity of the concept, the protection of civil rights and interests of criminal as well as the relief measures should also be further strengthened and improved. This paper is divided into three parts. The first chapter is to conduct a detailed overview of the status of the Protection System for Criminal. During the social development and international human rights movement, the Criminal penalty of thinking gradually develop towards civilization, the rise of human rights and humanitarian movement, as well as the status of the international struggle for human rights have contributed to the further protection of the rights and interests of criminals. This chapter also further elaborates that China's current Criminal law confers certain rights and interests. Chapter II analyzed the current situation and existing problems of the protection of the criminals' civil rights. In specific aspects of civil rights, criminal's Right to Physical Integrity and Health, Right of Reputation, Right of Privacy and Property Right, are subject to varying degrees of damage in practice. From the whole community level, the relatively lower social status of the criminals, police and criminals' weak sense of legality in the execution process, and vague understanding of the protection of the criminals' civil rights, all had greatly compromised the criminals' lawful civil rights and interests as a citizen, other than its criminal status. This chapter also analyzed the major factors accounting for the Protection of the criminal civil rights and interests. The severe-penalty doctrine, the lagging current situation of the criminal legislation and so on are detrimental the protection of the criminals' civil rights. The third chapter is to improve the concept of protecting the civil rights and interests of imprisoned criminals. The protection of rights and interests is a symbol of the rule of law. The prison should follow the rule of law and the most fundamental point is to protect the rights and interests of criminals. Drawing on a number of developed countries, such as France, Germany, Russia, Denmark and the like, in protecting the rights of criminals, on the basis of the practice and experience, combining the current legislative environment, to put forward a sound protection of the civil rights of prisoners in the proposal, propose complementary Legal mechanisms to enhance the intensity of the prison and accuracy of law enforcement, and put forward new requirements for the protection of legitimate rights and interests of",1875005133,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, JiaLiJiaLi, Jia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319436971 , 111161492 , 189128 , 10549330 , 10549330", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1875005133?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law,, 0398 Law, Law," (UMI)AAI10549330 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+protection+of+prisoners+in+civil+right-from+the+perspective+of+prison+management&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Jia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Study on orchestrating urban - rural development in xinyu, jiangxi","Translation from original language as provided by author This paper combines domestic and international research achievement and fulfillment experience and elaborated the background and meaning and textual main research contents and research method of thesis;Domestic and international theory and fulfillment about the harmonious development between urban and rural area, and give some examples;And introduces generalized Xinyu, analyze the transformation of the relationship between city and country, the problem and realistic meaning and the realistic possibility in the city and country integration construction;Elaborated the perfect series measures and the Xinyu model of the harmonious development between city and country.

Why could capital pose such a paradox of progressiveness and savageness? What is the ideology hidden behind the paradox? To approach answers to the above questions, we must carry out profound study on Marx's ideology of capital civilization. Marx thought that capital in its nature is not material, but relations, a kind of social relations particularly referring to the production relations in a society with capitalist class. Capital civilization is civilization propelled by capital in the society concentrating on capital. Capital is the cause of capital civilization and capital civilization is the positive effect of capital movement, therefore there is causality between them. However, we need to notice that the movement of capital relation has not only positive but also simultaneously negative effects. Therefore, study on capital civilization has to involve study on the negative or savage side of capital at the same time. There are four composing chapters in this dissertation. Chapter one mainly discussed the conceptions of capital and capital civilization, and summarized the research on capital civilization both at the domestic and international level. Chapter two analysed the motivator of civilization of capital or the capital logic from the perspective of historical materialism, pointing out that society showing a progressive orientation in the capital logic. Chapter three and Chapter four are the key parts of this dissertation. Chapter three mainly emphasised the duality of capital or the internal contradiction of capital from the ideological perspective. Capital has its internal contradiction by nature which decided itself as both the cause of capital civilization and negative effects of capital. Negation of capital civilization means that there is upper grade civilization to sublate it. Based on this, Chapter four as the concluding chapter of this dissertation mainly discussed why communism is the terminator of capital civilization. Both the termination of capital civilization and the arrival of communism are the objective tendency of the social contradiction evolution. The ideological breakthrough of this dissertation lies in two aspects: one is illustrating the contradictory and dual nature of capital in revealing the relation between the price paid for individual and social civilization and the contradictory nature of capital; the other is systemizing Marx's ideology of capital civilization as a whole, which has already had a perfect logic in thoughts but was not",1875021441,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhu, Zhi JieZhuJieZhiZhu, Zhi Jie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319473741 , 111172362 , 189128 , 10548870 , 10548870", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011,, Chinese, Chinese,,2011,PQDT - Global,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1875021441?accountid=14496, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy, 0422 Philosophy,, 0422 Philosophy, Philosophy," (UMI)AAI10548870 , Philosophy, religion and theology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+marx%27s+ideology+of+capital+civilization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhu%2C+Zhi+Jie&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"An ambivalent embrace: The cultural politics of Arabization and the knowledge economy in the Moroccan public school,"Based on eighteen months of fieldwork conducted in urban Moroccan high schools, this dissertation explores the relationship between Arabization – post-Independence nationalizing agenda – and public education. It argues that the contemporary tensions traversing the public school relate to Morocco's ambivalent cultural politics in the postcolonial period and to the social fragmentation this cultural politics has encouraged. During 2007 and 2008, Moroccan public education was widely acknowledged to be in crisis. Both government and international organizations recommended technical correctives to remodel student competences. What they disregarded is that the Arabized public school has been the cultural battleground for the negotiation of Morocco as postcolonial, modernized and developing country. In this light, the knowledge economy of the public school needs to be interrogated as a cultural frame with a socio-political history. Through classroom observations, discussions with students, teachers and parents and curricula analysis, I trace the Arabized school's ambiguous bilingualism between French and Arabic (fushā) and narrate how school participants encounter their colonial heritage as this is re-articulated in the discourse of development. Besides being endangered by the continuous promotion of the French language, Arabization suffers from internal contradictions; through its deployment for the preservation of monarchical authority, Arabization maintains the sacredness and immutability of fushā at the expense of the language's wider deployment in new spheres of expression. This tension frustrates students' efforts at social integration and leads to profound skepticism towards the state's moral authority. Arabization is further challenged by alternative portrayals of Moroccan-ness voiced by the Amazigh cultural movement, which is increasingly lending its vocabulary to students' self-narratives. Focusing on the practical articulation between school participants and institution, I nuance theories of socio-cultural reproduction, ideological interpellation and postcolonial criticism to account for unpredictability, incompleteness and ambivalence. These dynamics reconfigure the school, from mechanism of social and symbolic engineering to public space where the cultural politics of Morocco is debated. The debate engages discipline orientations, language form and language training, history, science, translation and moral cultivation. It extends to the experience of cultural politics outside the school where cultural identification and creativity get constantly re-signified through the everyday practices of students.",822244882,,Dissertations & Theses," Boutieri, CharisBoutieriCharisBoutieri, Charis",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2229242901 , 56866471 , 66569 , 9781124392707 , 3437751 , 3437751", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124392707, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/822244882?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0340 Educational sociology , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0340 Educational sociology , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0340 Educational sociology , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0340 Educational sociology , 0560 North African Studies , 0679 Language"," Cultural anthropology , Educational sociology , North African Studies , Language"," Education , Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Arabization , Development , Education , Knowledge economy , Language politics , Morocco , Postcolonialism , Public education , Translation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+ambivalent+embrace%3A+The+cultural+politics+of+Arabization+and+the+knowledge+economy+in+the+Moroccan+public+school&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Boutieri%2C+Charis&amp;isbn=9781124392707&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""“In the image of God”: A global history of the North American Congregational mission movement in Angola, 1879–1975","This dissertation provides a social, political, and global history of the Congregational mission movement in Angola. Around the world, Protestant American missions provided the non-western world with their first introduction to the US. And yet, the history of Protestant missionaries has not been fully integrated into histories about US relations with the world. Set between 1879 and 1975, “In the image of God” argues that America’s direct engagement in African affairs did not begin in the 1960s, as many studies assume, but nearly eighty years earlier, when Protestant missionaries first arrived in Angola intent on making direct political and social contacts with Africans. The fruits borne from this engagement not only altered the course of Angolan history but have affected the US’s official relations with the region into the post-cold war era. Despite good intentions, Congregational missionaries’ relations with Angolans were paternalistic. My study exposes how these mission relations would eventually influence post-World War II discussions about universal human rights. When missionaries arrived in Angola in 1879, they expected Angolans to conform to their idea of a proper western Christian lifestyle. By the middle of the twentieth-century, this relationship had changed and Angolans were in control of the shape and message of the Congregational Church, ultimately using mission connections to organize anti-colonial resistance. Congregational missionaries willfully ignored the signs that their congregants had transformed the missions’ original message and made it their own. When concerns about safety compelled most missionaries to leave Angola in the late 1960s, they were unable to disengage from Angolan politics. Instead, they seized upon the language of liberation and human rights to justify the continuation of their own colonialist relations with Angola. Using research conducted in Angola, South Africa, Portugal, Switzerland, and the United States, I offer a cautionary tale about the complexities of US relations in the world. My dissertation not only exposes the various forces at play during the US's emergence as a world power over the course of the 20th century, but raises important questions about the impact of this legacy on today's humanitarian projects.",858862014,,Dissertations & Theses," Burlingham, KateBurlinghamKateBurlingham, Kate",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2304062301 , 59656001 , 66569 , 9781124530857 , 3444911 , 3444911", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124530857, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/858862014?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history",," 0320 Religious history , 0330 Religious history , 0331 African history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," Religious history , African history , American history , Modern history , Religious congregations , Religious missions , Protestantism , Missionaries , United States--US , Angola"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Africa , African American history , Angola , Cold War , Congregational , Congregational Church , Missionaries , Portugal , Religion , Southern Africa , Sub-Saharan Africa , United States , United States foreign relations , World Council of Churches",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CIn+the+image+of+God%E2%80%9D%3A+A+global+history+of+the+North+American+Congregational+mission+movement+in+Angola%2C+1879%E2%80%931975&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burlingham%2C+Kate&amp;isbn=9781124530857&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Honest Bodies: Jewishness, Radicalism, and Modernism in Anna Sokolow's Choreography from 1927–1961","This dissertation investigates Jewishness, radicalism, and modernism, and the interplay and connections among these ideas, in selected dances by Anna Sokolow (1910–2000) between 1927–1961. As an American choreographer of Russian Jewish heritage known for her leftist leadership and socially conscious dances, whose early work was highly representational of working-class and Jewish identity, Sokolow could have been labeled as “ethnic” low art. Instead, she came to be embraced by influential mainstream dance critics, such as John Martin, Walter Terry, Louis Horst, and Doris Hering. I ask how Sokolow’s work came to be regarded as “modernist,” thus transcending racial and class markers to become “American” in the 1950s, and I analyze the change over time in how her work was regarded. I examine Sokolow’s work within the historical arc of 20th-century concert dance while using it as a point of departure for important discussions in 20 th - and 21 st -century dance, Jewish, and gender studies. I show that all of Sokolow’s work—not solely those dances labeled Jewish by critics and historians—was informed by her heritage, and is, in effect, Jewish. I argue that Sokolow intended to respond to the political zeitgeist through her choreography; her Jewishness and her politics were contingent upon one another. Finally, I demonstrate how the development of Sokolow’s choreographic aesthetic and the change in the way U.S. critics reviewed her work in the 1930s–1960s, from being integral to the workers movement, to making dances with overtly Jewish themes during the Holocaust, to reflecting postwar alienation, to directly addressing the Holocaust’s atrocities during the Cold War, reflects the assimilation of her generation of Jews into American society. I frame this study within discourses of radicalism, modernism, Jewishness, race, gender, representation and the body, identity politics, and performativity. I use these ideas as lenses through which to conduct a textual analysis of Sokolow’s dances through movement description and Laban Movement Analysis, and a consideration of the work within a wider cultural and historical context. Sources include photographs, film, live performances, Labanotation scores, critical reviews from the mainstream, leftist, and Jewish/Yiddish presses, in the United States, Mexico, and Israel, and dancers' recollections, through interviews, of their experiences performing the work. Additional archival sources include correspondence, clippings, and performance programs. Sokolow’s actions in Mexico City and Israel fed the international Jewish and radical currents integral to her work and representation; as such, the geographical foci for this study are the U.S. (primarily New York and Boston), Mexico City, and Israel. Implications of this study include fitting Sokolow, her work for social change, and her Jewish identity into the changing American socio-political landscape. The study not only illuminates an historical moment connecting social politics, American Judaism, and the arts, but it brings to light many aspects of Sokolow’s life and work that have yet to receive critical attention. Sokolow portrayed her political ideals, which were intertwined with her Jewish identity and modernist aesthetic, in her work that both reflected and reacted to the time in which she made it.",864744308,,Dissertations & Theses," Kosstrin, Hannah JoyKosstrinJoyHannahKosstrin, Hannah Joy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2337242521 , 61014671 , 66569 , 9781124578644 , 3451734 , 3451734", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124578644, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/864744308?accountid=14496, 0378 Dance, 0378 Dance, 0378 Dance,, 0378 Dance, Dance," Communication and the arts , Choreography , Jewishness , Modernism , Radicalism , Sokolow, Anna",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Honest+Bodies%3A+Jewishness%2C+Radicalism%2C+and+Modernism+in+Anna+Sokolow%27s+Choreography+from+1927%E2%80%931961&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kosstrin%2C+Hannah+Joy&amp;isbn=9781124578644&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""From gwoka modènn to jazz ka: Music, nationalism, and creolization in Guadeloupe","My dissertation explores the development of new musical styles based on gwoka , a Guadeloupean drum-based music and dance tradition. During five visits to Guadeloupe between 2007 and 2009, I interviewed musicians, music professionals, and cultural and political activists. In addition, I attended numerous musical performances, learned to play and dance gwoka, and performed with several ensembles. I combine this ethnographic data with archival evidence to reveal how Guadeloupe’s atypical path to decolonization and economic dependency has fueled the growth of nationalist sentiment on the island. Using transcriptions and analyses of musical recordings, I demonstrate how musicians have participated in Guadeloupe’s political debates by deploying specific musical strategies in order to define and express their national cultural identities. Following an ethnographic description of traditional gwoka as it is practiced in Guadeloupe today, I explore the music’s historical roots. I demonstrate how, from the eighteenth to the early twentieth century, colonial social dynamics not only allowed for the creation of new creole musical practices but also determined the social capital of these new musical genres, resulting in the stigmatization of African-derived music. Next, I reveal how separatist middle-class activists turned to rural African-derived music to build a sense of national cultural unity in the late 1960s. In the process, these militants modified gwoka to fit their cosmopolitan modernist values, adapting a participatory music for stage performance and adding European and North American instruments. I then follow the evolution of instrumental gwoka through the 1970s and ’80s, bringing to light the different musical strategies used to express Guadeloupean identity. Finally, I conclude by highlighting how a younger generation of Guadeloupean musicians have transformed both the form and meaning of instrumental gwoka in order to adapt to new economic and political conditions. These musicians, liberated from the weight of nationalist ideology, are able to embrace their creoleness and express transnational identities by mixing gwoka with other musical styles. Through the study of music, this project brings to light the political and cultural impact of Guadeloupe’s nationalist movement, thus offering a way to better understand contemporary Guadeloupean society. Using Guadeloupe as an example, this study contributes to our understanding of cultural nationalism in postcolonial societies. In particular, it reveals how music and discourse about music capture the tension between race and class solidarity as well as between national and diasporic consciousness. It demonstrates how nationalism, diasporic intimacy, and creolization restrict one another without being mutually exclusive. In response to the widespread use of creolization theories in globalization studies, this dissertation brings creolization home to the Caribbean to reveal its particular significance as a post-nationalist strategy.",865288973,,Dissertations & Theses," Camal, JeromeCamalJeromeCamal, Jerome",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2341055761 , 61161961 , 66569 , 9781124598208 , 3450719 , 3450719", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124598208, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/865288973?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0413 Music , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0413 Music , 0432 Caribbean Studies",," 0413 Music , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," Music , Caribbean Studies"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Creolization , Guadeloupe , Gwoka , Nationalism , Postcolonialism , Postnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+gwoka+mod%C3%A8nn+to+jazz+ka%3A+Music%2C+nationalism%2C+and+creolization+in+Guadeloupe&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Camal%2C+Jerome&amp;isbn=9781124598208&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Green city origins: Democratic resistance to the auto-oriented city in West Germany, 1960–1990","This study examines West German urban environmental history between 1960 and 1990. The histories of mass motorization and of the attempt to build cities around the automobile in West Germany (the “auto-oriented city,” as some planners had labeled it) are well known to historians. Less well known is the history of the reformist opposition, of the attempts to resist this automotive transformation and to forge urban models around a different set of ideals. Dissatisfied with the patterns of urban growth and development, a coalition of reformers emerged to exert greater influence on city planning processes and to refashion cities around their new ideals. This coalition consisted of planners, architects, grassroots citizens’ initiatives, environmentalists, intellectuals, students, and some politicians. The reformers’ central grievance concerned the effects of the auto-oriented city. They insisted that it was eroding urban residents’ quality of life, safety, sense of aesthetics, and emotional ties to urban history and culture, as well as deteriorating the natural and built environments. Their agenda was both negative (they wanted to stop what they viewed as outsized and destructive infrastructural projects) and positive (they wanted to develop and use urban space according to their social, aesthetic, and environmental ideals). Moreover, their agenda contained a significant political component, as they insisted that planning practice in West Germany was undemocratic. This aspect of their agenda, and their attempts to democratize local planning processes, therefore places this study in the context of West Germany’s political history. By the 1980s, the reformers had achieved partial success. They took advantage of shifting circumstances in the political and social climate to implement at least part of their agenda. Their efforts presaged current planning discourse about environmental sustainability and cities. The dissertation includes case studies of Munich and Erlangen but also draws from the experiences of other cities in West Germany and abroad. The study contains chapters on local politics, urbanism and the environmental movement, the international context, and the histories of pedestrian zones, bicycling, and traffic calming. A final chapter analyzes a contemporary planning controversy in Stuttgart in the context of this history.",865316446,,Dissertations & Theses," Engelke, Peter OwenEngelkeOwenPeterEngelke, Peter Owen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2341122961 , 61165221 , 66569 , 9781124598314 , 3450727 , 3450727", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124598314, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/865316446?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0474 Environmental management , 0582 Modern history , 0999 Urban planning"," 0335 European history , 0474 Environmental management , 0582 Modern history , 0999 Urban planning"," 0335 European history , 0474 Environmental management , 0582 Modern history , 0999 Urban planning",," 0335 European history , 0474 Environmental management , 0582 Modern history , 0999 Urban planning"," European history , Environmental management , Modern history , Urban planning"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Auto-oriented city , Environmental history , Environmental movement , Europe , Germany , Planning history , Urban history , Urban planning , West Germany",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Green+city+origins%3A+Democratic+resistance+to+the+auto-oriented+city+in+West+Germany%2C+1960%E2%80%931990&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Engelke%2C+Peter+Owen&amp;isbn=9781124598314&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Medicalization as a rising rational myth: Population health implications, reproduction, and public response","In this dissertation, I study medicalization, a wide spread phenomenon in this world but understudied in the current literature. The main theoretical focus of this dissertation is on expanding the medicalization theories. Questioning the breadth of conceptualization, the feasibility of measurement, and the depth of empirical implications in the extant medicalization theories, this dissertation proposes a new conceptual model of medicalization and further develops a quantitative measure of medicalization by disaggregating it into empirically valid dimensions that could be used to examine how degree of medicalization is related to social outcomes. Specifically, I conceptualize medicalization as an institutionalization process whereby the medical model becomes increasingly dominant in the explanation of health, illness, and other human problems and behavior. Medicalization is multidimensional and is represented by expansions in the three major components of the health care system: increasing medical investment, medical professionalization/specialization, and the relative size of the pharmaceutical industry. Based on this new conceptual model and measurement, I probe three research questions: (1) how medicalization may impact population health in the context of recent epidemiologic transitions and how this impact may differ by the stages of epidemiologic transition and socioeconomic development; (2) what are the mechanisms that reproduce medicalization; and (3) how the lay public may respond to medicalization, the institution of medicine, and the medical profession. This dissertation links several lines of theoretical and empirical research from medical sociology, demography, epidemiology, health economics and management, and medical science, and extensively employs OECD Health Data, World Development Indicators, the World Values Survey, the European Values Study data, the U.S. General Social Survey, and the U.S. National Health Interview Survey. It uses several advanced statistical methods, e.g., multiple imputations, latent variable analysis, mixed models, generalized estimating equations models, generalized method of moments models, difference-in-difference models, and hierarchical-age-period-cohort models. Results for the first research question suggest that various dimensions of medicalization vary in importance on population health and these effects also differ by the stages of epidemiologic transition and socioeconomic development. I discuss the mechanisms linking various dimensions of medicalization to population health and then discuss these findings in the context of epidemiologic transition, fundamental causes of disease and death, and global health movement. Results for the second research question suggest that medicalization at both the societal and individual levels negatively affect individual subjective health, which leads to increasing health care utilization. These social processes function together to promote and reproduce medicalization at societal level. I discuss several pathways linking medicalization to lower subjective health and other agents of medicalization. Results for the third research question suggest that American's ""confidence in the medical institution and profession"" has continuously declined in the last three decades and groups with higher socioeconomic status report lower obedience to doctors' authority, but are more likely to trust doctors' ethics than their counterparts. I discuss the mechanisms for the changes in public confidence in the medical institution and profession, the status of medicine and the medical profession in the era of medicalization, the paradox of opposite trends in attitudes toward medicine and health utilization behavior, and group differences in obedience and trust.",866157774,,Dissertations & Theses," Zheng, HuiZhengHuiZheng, Hui",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2344778001 , 61272501 , 66569 , 9781124614083 , 3453407 , 3453407", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124614083, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/866157774?accountid=14496," 0573 Public health , 0700 Social structure , 0938 Demography"," 0573 Public health , 0700 Social structure , 0938 Demography"," 0573 Public health , 0700 Social structure , 0938 Demography",," 0573 Public health , 0700 Social structure , 0938 Demography"," Public health , Social structure , Demography , Population , Reproduction"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Confidence in medicine , Medical investment , Medical professionalization/specialization , Medicalization , Pharmaceutical industry , Population health , Professionalization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Medicalization+as+a+rising+rational+myth%3A+Population+health+implications%2C+reproduction%2C+and+public+response&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zheng%2C+Hui&amp;isbn=9781124614083&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Between Reconciliation and Justice: The Struggles for Justice and Reconciliation in Colombia,"Over the past decades, Colombian society has endured the impact of a longstanding political conflict among different actors and outrageous expressions of violence, especially among left wing guerrillas, right wing paramilitary groups and the state government. Drawing on socio-legal studies in transitional justice and human rights, this research attempts to analyze the recent experience of transitional justice in Colombia. The main purpose of this research is to understand how political, institutional and social actors, especially the government, the courts, the human rights and transitional justice NGOs, and victims associations, frame the mechanisms of transitional justice and use legal instruments to transform the conflict and reach what they consider ""justice."" It also attempts to understand the relations between politics and law in the context of a hegemonic discourse of security and give account of the expressions of resistance of human rights networks. In doing so, this research advances theory on literature about law and society and transitional justice by means of applying and expanding the theoretical framework of socio-legal research via the process of transitional justice in Colombia. The dissertation presents information gathered in the field in Colombia between July 2009 and July 2010 through a qualitative research design based on document analysis and in-depth interviews with members of different international and domestic human rights organizations, victims' organizations and national institutions. The research explains how these organizations combined political and legal actions in order to contest a project of security, and more specifically a project of impunity that came from negotiations with the paramilitary groups.

Writing between 1880 to 1920, and within the context of the women‘s movement, a cluster of British female writers—such as Flora Annie Steel, Bithia Mary Croker, Alice Perrin, Fanny Emily Penny and Ida Alexa Ross Wylie—communicate both a fear of and an attraction towards two interconnected, long-enduring communities of Indian female performers: the tawaifs (Muslim courtesans of Northern India) and the devadasis (Hindu temple dancers of Southern India). More specifically, the authors grapple with the recognition that these anomalous Indian women have liberties (political, financial, social, and sexual) that British women do not. This recognition significantly undermines the imperial feminist rhetoric circulating at the time that positioned British women as the most emancipated females in the world and as the natural leaders of the international women‘s movement. The body chapters explore the various ways in which these fictional devadasis or tawaifs test imperial feminism, starting with their threat to the Memsahib‘s imperial role in the Anglo-Indian home in the first chapter, their seduction of burdened Anglo-Indian domestic women in the second chapter, their terrorization of the British female adventuress in the third chapter, and ending with their appeal to fin-de-siècle dancers searching for a modern femininity in the final chapter. My project is urgent at a time when imperial feminism is becoming the dominant narrative by which we are being trained to read encounters between British and Indian women, at the expense of uncovering alternative readings. I conclude the dissertation by suggesting that the recovery of these alternative readings can be the starting point for rethinking the hierarchies and the boundaries separating First World from Third World feminisms today.",870030955,,Dissertations & Theses," Jagpal, Charn Kamal KaurJagpalKamal KaurCharnJagpal, Charn Kamal Kaur",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2365416851 , 59239231 , 66569 , 9780494732755 , NR73275 , NR73275", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9780494732755, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/870030955?accountid=14496, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature, 0593 British and Irish literature,, 0593 British and Irish literature, British and Irish literature," Language, literature and linguistics , Croker, Bithia Mary , Fin de siecle , Imperial feminism , Nautch girl , Penny, Fanny Emily , Perrin, Alice , Steel, Flora Annie , Wylie, Ida Alexa Ross",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CI+Mean+to+Win%E2%80%9D%3A+The+Nautch+Girl+and+Imperial+Feminism+at+the+Fin+de+Si%C3%A8cle&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jagpal%2C+Charn+Kamal+Kaur&amp;isbn=9780494732755&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Conjuring and avoiding the “bad man”: Narratives of crime and fear in Trinidad,"Upper middle and upper class Trinidadians are equally though differently entangled in the effects of global, regional and local processes of crime, risk and fear as their counterparts from lower classes. A recent rapid increase in violent crime and particularly a five-fold increase in murder rates in under ten years has caused a shift in lifestyle patterns and a re-imagining of social, public and private space in the country. Upper class groups conjure and employ an image of a classed and raced 'bad man' who is held responsible for increases in crime and gang violence and is the locus for anxieties for fears for personal safety and the future of the nation. My research shows that upper middle and upper classes increasingly assert, re-create and negotiate their class position with reference to changing informal rules of 'safe' behaviour and movement in reference to this conjured 'bad man'. Home spaces are created and fortified against those construed as 'risky'. Informal rules of appropriate 'safe' behaviour are negotiated and emerge through endless talk of crime. This talk re-imagines and reifies nearly all lower classes as 'risky' and the conclusions of this talk invariably lead to greater attempted isolation of upper classes from lower classes. National elections in 2007 and 2010 point to a potential long-term shift away from racialized voting patterns, even as racialized and classed stereotypes flourish. Recent successes of an ostensibly non-racial third political party point to new electoral paradigms and indicate that increases in crime and fear of crime supercede more simplistic race-based allegiances. A paradox, between upper class attempts at increased isolation from crime and continued re-imagining of markers of classed and racialized difference on the one hand, and a perhaps historic change in voting patterns away from long held notions of racial difference on the other hand weave throughout this dissertation and point to the ways in which understandings of risk and crime can influence social change.",871417500,,Dissertations & Theses," Geer, Sacha AnnGeerAnnSachaGeer, Sacha Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2373111171 , 62275921 , 66569 , 9780494740026 , NR74002 , NR74002", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9780494740026, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/871417500?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Cultural anthropology , Caribbean Studies , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Crime narratives , Racialization , Social class , Trinidad and Tobago",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Conjuring+and+avoiding+the+%E2%80%9Cbad+man%E2%80%9D%3A+Narratives+of+crime+and+fear+in+Trinidad&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Geer%2C+Sacha+Ann&amp;isbn=9780494740026&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The seduction of feminist theory,"My dissertation, ""The Seduction of Feminist Theory,"" comes out of my research on South African fiction and the Truth and Reconciliation Commission, and focuses broadly on feminist theory and the question of female power. The work of French theorist and sociologist Jean Baudrillard provides me with the conceptual model and critical vocabulary to reframe feminist theory. In the first chapter, I argue that Baudrillard has not offered feminism an entirely unfamiliar theory of resistance. It is more that feminists have yet to read feminism seductively. Baudrillard's theory allows me to accentuate seduction in earlier feminist writing that is either dismissed by more productive-minded feminists or championed for making apparently productive arguments. Virginia Woolf, I suggest, by avocating laughter as a response to patriarchy, was among the first feminists in whom we can identify seduction as a feminist practice. Once I saw laughter as a seductive writing practice, I began to perceive a resonance of seduction echoing throughout the work of feminists from French theorists such as Joan Rivière, Hélène Cixous, and Luce Irigaray, to contemporary American scholars such as Judith Butler, Donna Haraway, and Trinh T. Minh-Ha. My second chapter addresses feminism of the Progressive Era and argues that focusing on productive discourse systematically disempowers women. In documenting the labor of lower-class women, reformers such as Cornelia Stratton Parker and Charlotte Perkins Gilman established feminism as a materialist practice grounded in production. Defining women's power in relation to production, however, does not further women's status in society. An effective feminist movement would, alternatively, attempt to break down the idea of production as power. There is no language with which to define women as powerful in the Progressive discourse insofar as it establishes production as the only form of social value. I re-read Edith Wharton's The House of Mirth (1905) as resistant to the feminism promoted by reformers such as Gilman and Parker. Wharton, I argue, negotiates a seductive alternative in her characterization of Lily Bart. My third chapter addresses the feminist insistence on sexual equality in the modernist era. I begin by presenting work of feminist sexual reformers such as Margaret Sanger, Mary Ware Dennet, and Helena Rosa Wright who argue that women must be allowed control over their reproductive function and enjoy sex on a par with men. However, such arguments unwittingly disempower women who do not confirm the social value of sex. I explore the public social success of Irene Castle in relation to modern fictional characters such as Lorelei Lee, Myrtle Wilson, and Florinda to demonstrate that social mobility, as imagined by authors in the '20s, was contingent upon a woman's ability to seduce while denying engagement in sex--that is, not through sex, but through performing femininity. I explore the significance of this shift in relation to the work of Liz Conor who, in The Spectacular Modern Woman (2004), argues that the ""modern appearing woman,"" far from being objectified, provides a way of rethinking agency outside of the terms provided by masculine discourse. To bridge the gap between the modernist and postmodernist eras, I include a short piece, ""Post-war Feminism: An Interlude,"" addressing the dearth of feminist scholarship on the post-war period. I argue that embracing the ideology of production has led feminists to assume that Betty Friedan was the only serious feminist writing in the post-war era. Recognizing seduction as a feminist reading practice allows commonly dismissed feminists, such as Cosmopolitan editor Helen Gurly Brown and humor writer Shirley Jackson, into the feminist canon. My fourth chapter examines what happens to the concepts of the modern woman and modern feminism in postmodern literature within a global framework. Drawing on Baudrillard's insight, I explore the significance of silence as an untapped resource for the disruption of power in an era dependant on the proliferation of speech. Using Isabelle Allende's House of Spirits (1986), Salman Rushdie's Midnight's Children (1981), and J.M. Coetzee's Waiting for the Barbarians (1980), postmodern novels which explore the proliferation of speech and information within the current postmodern condition, I show the way silent female characters function to thwart power in a global society contingent on the assumption that speech is an expression of the real. My fifth and final chapter takes my analysis of literature and feminist theory into the social and political arena. My readings of women's silence in the post-apartheid hearings before the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) explore the political significance of the shift from modern laughter to postmodern silence. By paying close attention to the gaps and silences within the TRC testimonies, I seek to establish a new discourse recognizing silence as, in Baudrillard's words, ""the immense, latent defection"" from productivist discourse.

New technologies paired with voluntary and involuntary mass migrations have created the opportunity for people to define themselves in new, multi-dimensional, and dynamic ways, no longer solely based on the confines of the nation-state. While continuing to battle the global political, social, and economic structure set in place by the colonial past, post-colonial thinkers have added a new dimension to their scholarship by theorizing how the increased movement of people and information has created a shift in both identity politics and in the area of center and periphery studies. While many scholars have focused their attention on how this shift in identity politics has impacted topics in contemporary art, few art historians have addressed how this shift has transformed the meaning, purpose, content, and effects of public art. This thesis will address this void in scholarship by examining the diverse impact of the changing meaning of identity on contemporary public art using multiple case studies of community-building public art projects commissioned internationally. Looking specifically to public projects that instigate dialogue via technology, the land, and the confrontation of public space, I contend that public artists working today are able to counteract the detrimental forces of globalization by embracing the potential benefits of this phenomenon.",873459411,,Dissertations & Theses," Goldstein, LoriGoldsteinLoriGoldstein, Lori",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2382654701 , 62609141 , 66569 , 9781124672045 , 1493870 , 1493870", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124672045, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/873459411?accountid=14496," 0365 Art Criticism , 0377 Art history"," 0365 Art Criticism , 0377 Art history"," 0365 Art Criticism , 0377 Art history",," 0365 Art Criticism , 0377 Art history"," Art Criticism , Art history"," Communication and the arts , Community , Ecology , Globalization , Identity , Public art , Technology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Counteractions%3A+Resisting+and+embracing+globalization+in+contemporary+public+art&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goldstein%2C+Lori&amp;isbn=9781124672045&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Slum Dwellers, Bankers and Bureaucrats: A Historical Comparative Analysis of State Formation, Urbanization and the United Nations in East Africa","This dissertation explores the process by which UN-Habitat, the United Nations housing and urban development agency, changed the way it worked with governments to reduce poverty in East African cities. In the 1980s the focus of its assistance was the central government. By 2005 the organization engaged cities, social movements, and private industries. While it continued to serve government, UN-Habitat worked with the State through municipal, community and private actors. The author posits that the agency changed as the governments it served decentralized, democratized, and privatized. These policies required the State to cede power to cities, social movements and industry, so the agency helped governments engage new actors. The dissertation subjects this claim to historical comparative analyses of state formation, urbanization, and UN-Habitat field operations. The author argues that the narrow economy and indirect rule left a troubling colonial legacy. Attempting redress, African States over-compensated. These actions weakened their ability to handle global crisis and negotiate structural adjustment. In the 1990s East Africa stabilized partially, yet remained dependent on cash crops and struggled with forms of political representation. In Kenya, European settlers triggered squatter rebellion prompting social engineering that produced class divisions, ethnic rivalries and heavy State control. Colonial agreements in Uganda privileged Kingdoms making for a weak nation-state. Devolution replaced dictatorship after years of unrest but recovery reinforced regional divisions and delayed pluralism. Tanzania exchanged a weak colonial economy with an ambitious but unviable socialist project. Adjustment stabilized the economy but at great social cost and without reform to the constitution or the ruling party. In the comparative history of East African cities, the author finds that urbanization resulted from and contributed to the colonial economy but not indirect rule. Heterogeneity in the city and the labor requirements of industry prevented manipulation of tribal chiefs as happened in rural districts. Rapid urbanization, narrow economic growth, and weak urban governance after independence combined to create urban spaces dominated by informality. Slums reproduced the contradictions of national politics. The results in Nairobi were dense, commercialized slums that mirrored the nation's troubled ethnic history. Kampala, the seat of power for Baganda and colonial, cum-African State was a proxy for the war on Kingdoms. Sprawling, un-serviced Dar es Salaam reflected the anti-urban tenor of socialism, laisse faire city planning, yet an accommodating Swahili culture. Analysis of UN-Habitat's Community Development Program, the Global Campaign for Secure Tenure and the Slum Upgrading Facility reveals the value and limits of working with the State through non-State actors. The author finds the problems the agency encountered relate directly to the history of East African nations, cities and slums. In its efforts to guide decentralization, democratization and privatization, the agency became embedded; its initiatives often serving as instruments of a reticent State. The author concludes by identifying ways to use reflexive sociology applied in this dissertation to strengthen the transformative role of the United Nations.",874604532,,Dissertations & Theses," Williams, Christopher WilsonWilliamsWilsonChristopherWilliams, Christopher Wilson",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2390464651 , 62774551 , 66569 , 9781124694689 , 3458123 , 3458123", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124694689, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/874604532?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning"," 0601 International Relations , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning"," 0601 International Relations , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning",," 0601 International Relations , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies , 0700 Social structure , 0999 Urban planning"," International Relations , Sub Saharan Africa Studies , Social structure , Urban planning , Housing developments , Urban development , Comparative analysis , African history , Statehood , Poverty , East Africa"," Social sciences , Decentralization and privatization , Development studies , East Africa , Slum dwellers , Social movements , State formation , United Nations , Urbanization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Slum+Dwellers%2C+Bankers+and+Bureaucrats%3A+A+Historical+Comparative+Analysis+of+State+Formation%2C+Urbanization+and+the+United+Nations+in+East+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Williams%2C+Christopher+Wilson&amp;isbn=9781124694689&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""State, law, and revolution: Agrarian power and the national state in Albania, 1850-1945","Prevailing approaches in the comparative historical study of peasant mobilization assume the relationship between peasants and state institutions to be inherently antagonistic. By contrast, this dissertation argues that locally embedded legal cultures are crucial in mediating and delimiting the institutional role of the state in agrarian social life. Using the case of national state building in post-Ottoman Albania, the dissertation shows that establishing national control over regionally-based socio-legal institutions was a crucial challenge faced by Ottoman successor states. Relying on official Albanian state documents only recently made available to international scholars, the dissertation shows that efforts by national bureaucratic elites to transform traditional socio-legal arrangements were a contentious process with direct impact on local state capacities and peasant politics. The dissertation demonstrates the divergent impact of legal centralization on peasant politicization by comparing two agrarian regions: (1) the çiftlik agrarian class system in Albania's fertile lowland regions and (2) the smallholding and self-governing communities of Albania's rugged highlands. In the lowlands, the state successfully established national administration over local political and juridical authorities, but the consequence of this was the increasing politicization of agrarian class relations. The nationalization and reform of lowland socio-legal institutions resulted in the disintegration of Ottoman-era legal protections of peasant subsistence rights, leading to intensified social conflict between peasants and landowners. Peasants engaged in public acts of politicization of agrarian relations which involved the state both as an actor as well as a legal institutional arena. As a result, during the revolutionary mobilization in the 1940s, lowland peasants responded sympathetically to the radical agrarian platform of the Albanian communist movement. In the highlands, efforts to assert national authority over local communal organization and traditions of customary law resulted in a different type of peasant resistance. From once guaranteeing local communal autonomy, the state moved to delegitimize communal peasant law and socio-legal practices. Highland peasant communities responded by directly challenging the state's administrative practices via acts of subversion and became more accepting of conservative politics. The dissertation underscores the link between legal cultures, peasant politics and the historical variability of state capacities.",875963012,,Dissertations & Theses," Pula, BesnikPulaBesnikPula, Besnik",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2396548131 , 62396871 , 66569 , 9781124687605 , 3459074 , 3459074", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124687605, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/875963012?accountid=14496," 0437 East European Studies , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," 0437 East European Studies , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," 0437 East European Studies , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure",," 0437 East European Studies , 0582 Modern history , 0700 Social structure"," East European Studies , Modern history , Social structure"," Social sciences , Albania , Legal pluralism , Legal reform , Ottoman Empire , Peasants , State building",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=State%2C+law%2C+and+revolution%3A++Agrarian+power+and+the+national+state+in+Albania%2C+1850-1945&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pula%2C+Besnik&amp;isbn=9781124687605&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The bi-national path to immigrant U.S. political incorporation: Chicago's Mexican hometown associations, state projects, and social mobilization in an era of globalization","The many first-generation Mexican immigrant hometown associations (HTAs) in U.S. cities have been recognized as important largely for sustaining transnational ties between immigrants and their sending society. Yet recent activities in Chicago, including HTA leadership of the dramatic 2006 marches for immigrant rights, suggest that this kind of organization—and, indeed, mobilization itself—may become a significant agent of political incorporation for U.S. immigrants. This case study focuses on the evolution of 270 Midwestern HTAs and nine state-level federations into a broader leadership confederation based in Chicago, CONFEMEX, and poses two related questions to guide the study. First, why did CONFEMEX eventually shift from a Mexican-focused to a bi-national Mexico-U.S.-focused agenda and how has this shift affected the political activities of the confederation? Second, why did CONFEMEX and its HTA base come to embrace contentious activism and what have been the impacts of this step for immigration policy and politics, for HTAs as organizations, and for immigrant leaders themselves? This dissertation argues that recent theories influenced by the ""transnationalist"" lens, which emphasizes sending-society political ties, do not effectively explain the evolution of Chicago HTAs' activities because they fail to pay adequate attention to the U.S. political environment and how it has come to influence HTA activism. Using a social movement approach, I contend that the growing importance of U.S.-focused activities for CONFEMEX as well as its eventual embrace of popular mobilization strategies resulted from its interaction with multiple government entities in Mexico and, especially, in the United States, including national and state-level actors. By examining how these varied governmental actors worked at different times to support, suppress, or reincorporate CONFEMEX, we can see how the changing form and direction of HTA activism—not only popular mobilization but also, most recently, interest-group consolidation—represent immigrant leaders' responses to shifting and cross-cutting state projects in an era of neoliberal globalization. To develop this argument, the study begins by investigating the enhanced political legitimacy conferred upon the Midwest HTA confederation—CONFEMEX—by the Mexican government's diaspora reincorporation programs during the 1990s and, in particular, by Chicago-based consular support. The dissertation continues by exploring the contrasting impacts of a threatening post-9/11 U.S. anti-immigrant politics and a quite different—and powerfully legitimating—set of Illinois state-government programs that, starting in 2005, courted Mexican HTAs as attractive voting blocs. The final sections of the dissertation center on the activities of CONFEMEX in the wake of a qualitatively new level of anti-immigrant pressures that emerged in U.S. national politics in 2005. Focusing closely on the response of immigrant organizations to the passage by the U.S. House of Representatives of the Sensenbrenner bill in late 2005, the study examines how CONFEMEX became one of Chicago's leading sponsors of the 2006 immigrant rights marches as well as how the organization developed closer political relationships with other immigrant groups and with state and local officials in Illinois. By tracing the post-2006 political developments and governmental projects in relation to HTAs' evolving repertoires of action, I demonstrate that CONFEMEX would come to operate as an important interest group and agent of U.S. political incorporation for Chicago's Mexican immigrant community, though not without also creating significant intra-organizational tensions. The broader conceptual framework for this dissertation draws on theoretical insights from three major scholarly literatures—social movement paradigms, the political economy of globalization, and theories of the state—as well as from the growing body of research on the transnational politics of Mexican immigrant organizations. Empirically, this case study relies on organizational archival data made available to the author by CONFEMEX and consular records and on evidence from two years of participant-observation research within the leadership circles of organization, as well as 31 key informant interviews with CONFEMEX leaders, local grassroots immigrant activists, and Illinois state and Mexican consular officials in Chicago. The study findings provide important insights into how multiple Mexican and U.S. state projects become principal influences on the evolution of HTA organizational strategies that have had significant impacts on the emerging political identities of Mexican immigrants in the United States.",876288539,,Dissertations & Theses," Vonderlack-Navarro, RebeccaVonderlack-NavarroRebeccaVonderlack-Navarro, Rebecca",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2398456311 , 60012491 , 66569 , 9781124718323 , 3460249 , 3460249", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124718323, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/876288539?accountid=14496," 0452 Social work , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0452 Social work , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0452 Social work , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0452 Social work , 0616 International law , 0700 Social structure , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Social work , International law , Social structure , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Hometown associations , Illinois , Immigration , Social movements , State projects , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+bi-national+path+to+immigrant+U.S.+political+incorporation%3A+Chicago%27s+Mexican+hometown+associations%2C+state+projects%2C+and+social+mobilization+in+an+era+of+globalization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vonderlack-Navarro%2C+Rebecca&amp;isbn=9781124718323&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Secret Lives of the City: Reimagining the Urban Margins in 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-Century Literature and Theory, from Surrealism to Iain Sinclair","This dissertation traces a history of literary and theoretical narratives that posit a hidden dimension to familiar cityscapes as a way of questioning cultural values, historicizing the present, and envisioning new horizons of social possibility. Connected to broader struggles over the definitions of reality and experience, but also distinguished by their attempt to ground philosophical propositions in explorations of local environments, these counter-representations of public spaces constitute a tradition of cultural contestation that operates at the very foundations of knowledge and within the realm of everyday practices. Focusing on the impact of postwar suburban development, the rise of car culture and the proliferation of freeways, I investigate how the changing shape of urban space has opened up and foreclosed ways of imagining the city in recent decades. The first part of the project examines how Surrealism and the Situationist International produce a discursive public sphere based on the public spaces that they shared with their audiences. I argue that, as a strategy of communicating the possibility of agency, these avant-garde movements propose phenomenologies of urban space that scale the city to individual experience and action, rejecting the representation of the urban subject as anonymous and powerless before the complex social institutions and geographical expanse of the city. At the same time, they rehabilitate the desire for collective life by emphasizing a binding investment in public space, and by privileging common spaces as the primary venue of formative experiences. The second part investigates the legacy of this avant-garde strategy in a cityscape transformed by freeways and suburbs, discussing works by Thomas Pynchon, J. G. Ballard, François Maspero, Iain Sinclair that depict the geographical and social dislocations of what sociologist Manuel Castells calls “the network society.” Like the Surrealists and Situationists, these authors regard marginal spaces as repositories of suppressed cultural memory and indications of alternative images of the future. Through close readings of individual works, I show how they negotiate critical and utopian attitudes, by considering the exclusion of certain spaces from dominant networks of resources as productive not only of inequality but also, potentially, of autonomy.",878486079,,Dissertations & Theses," Hui Bon Hoa, Jennifer LynnHui Bon HoaLynnJenniferHui Bon Hoa, Jennifer Lynn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2404022571 , 62972281 , 66569 , 9781124747880 , 3462522 , 3462522", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124747880, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/878486079?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0440 European Studies , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0440 European Studies , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0440 European Studies , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0313 Romance literature , 0440 European Studies , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Comparative literature , Modern literature , Romance literature , European Studies , American literature , British and Irish literature"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Ballard, J.

It looks at printmaking as a discipline particularly suited to challenging colonial and aesthetic hierarchies that have traditionally structured art markets, art practice, and art education in Oaxaca City. In Mexico, art and cultural production have maintained a more direct relationship with state power than in other countries, and this thesis outlines various artistic authenticities that, while no means exhaustive, have been important in establishing a certain aesthetic of Mexican printmaking since the Mexican Revolution. These include the legacies of José Guadalupe Posada, muralism, the Taller de Gráfica Popular, La Ruptura, and the student movement of 1968, as well as particularly Oaxacan authenticities established by the Oaxacan Style and the street art produced in response to the teacher's strike of 2006-2007. As the idea of the nation-state is disintegrating with the rise of a global capitalism and increased ease and speed of communication, it is important to consider the changing relationships between the state and cultural production in Mexico, and especially in Oaxaca. In Oaxaca, many people depend on a successful tourist industry, which is inherently linked to state policies and state money. Political and social upheaval in Oaxaca have reshaped the relationship Oaxacans have with their government, and have created new spaces for art that allow young printmakers to challenge traditional artistic Mexican and Oaxacan hierarchies.",879417881,,Dissertations & Theses," Gibson, Hannah PeterkortGibsonPeterkortHannahGibson, Hannah Peterkort",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2408590551 , 62551061 , 66569 , 9781124720630 , 1495254 , 1495254", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124720630, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/879417881?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0814 Recreation"," 0336 Latin American history , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0814 Recreation"," 0336 Latin American history , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0814 Recreation",," 0336 Latin American history , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0814 Recreation"," Latin American history , Art history , Latin American Studies , Recreation"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Art , Colonial , Contemporary , Mexico , Oaxaca , Posada, Jose Guadalupe , Printmaking , Studio",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Power%2C+Politics%2C+and+Prints%3A+Redefining+Art+Practice+in+Oaxaca+City&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gibson%2C+Hannah+Peterkort&amp;isbn=9781124720630&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Dar el-Odaba: Afro-Asian Writers Remapping Blackness and Afro-Arab Identities,"Inspired by the formation of the Non-Aligned Movement's declaration of anti-colonial political and economic unity, the Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers was formed during the 1958 Conference for Afro-Asian Writers that gathered novelists, poets and playwrights from across Asia and Africa in Tashkent. The Bureau devoted itself to cultural resistance as a tool of revolution. In the interest of turning its members' talents for writing into a tactic for independence, the Bureau decided at its second conference in Cairo (1962) to produce a literary magazine intended to serve, ""the cause of national liberation and the struggle for freedom, independence and human dignity."" Initially entitled Afro-Asian Writings , the magazine was renamed Lotus when the Permanent Bureau of Afro-Asian Writers moved its headquarters from Colombo to Cairo. Gauging from the letters to the editor between 1972 (the first year they appeared) through 1978, the readers of Lotus hailed from major urban centers in the United States and Canada, Russia, Georgia, Ethiopia, Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), India, Ghana and other countries through Africa and Asia. It is in the pages of this forgotten magazine, this relic of an unspoken black internationalism and overt quest for Afro-Asian cultural unity, that reveal the ideological shifts of the anti-colonial movement and the tools with which to map it. This project seeks to identify within Lotus the loss of anti-colonial Third World unity as it played out politically within the NAM, as well as its potential implications for the revolutions of 2011. It is therefore likely that Black Studies and Arab American Studies, as they both strive to become more transnational in content, share quite a few goals in terms of their scholarly and social justice aims. This project builds on the Afro-Arab-Asian comparative work produced by Ali Mazrui, Nadine Naber, Suheir Hammad, Vijay Prashad, Manning Marable and Rashid Khalidi in the past twenty years that must be engaged in order to strengthen ethnic studies fields and open up the space for truly comparative and global study of racial classifications beyond the Western world.

By presenting economic modernization and development as an opportunity for third world nations to assert their national masculinity (throwing over both passive, indigenous selves and ancient, matriarchal societies) and thus enter into a global brotherhood of nations, the Peace Corps and its volunteers helped paint the United States as an altruistic partner in anti-imperialist struggles for self-determination. Using gender theory and critical development studies frameworks to analyze policy and archival documents, volunteer memoirs, popular novels, oral history interviews, and other cultural texts, this dissertation analyzes the Peace Corps' vision of worldwide modernization as it appeared in agency rhetoric, iconography, and policy; in encounters between volunteers and people in the countries where they served; and in the social movements that emerged to challenge U.S. power as the decade progressed. Chapters 1 and 2 explore Peace Corps discourses of liberal development and rugged altruism in the agency's early years. Chapters 3, 4, and 5 trace the connections between the Peace Corps and 1960s movement cultures. In these chapters, I consider how women volunteers imagined their relationship to both frontier masculinity and feminism as well as how modernization discourses pioneered by the Peace Corps shaped the civil rights, Black Power, and antiwar movements. Chapter 6 and the conclusion study the Peace Corps' experience in Bolivia, examining U.S. influence on Bolivian development practices and the agency's 1971 expulsion after their population control policies were publicized by the radical neorealist feature film Yawar Mallku (Blood of the Condor) .",879784372,,Dissertations & Theses," Geidel, MollyGeidelMollyGeidel, Molly",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2410931011 , 55489001 , 66569 , 9781124751290 , 3463127 , 3463127", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124751290, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/879784372?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0323 American studies , 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," American studies , Latin American history , American history , Latin American Studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Bolivia , Gender , Imperialism , Nineteen 60s , Peace Corps , Social movements - 1960s , United States imperialism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+point+of+the+lance%3A+Gender%2C+development%2C+and+the+1960s+Peace+Corps&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Geidel%2C+Molly&amp;isbn=9781124751290&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Solving the “Coffee Paradox”: Understanding Ethiopia's coffee cooperatives through Elinor Ostrom's theory of the commons,"This dissertation evaluates the applicability of Elinor Ostrom's theory of the commons to other forms of collective action by mapping it on a case study of the Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union in Ethiopia and its efforts to overcome the vast disparities that have long structured the global coffee commodity chain (the ""Coffee Paradox""). The conclusions I draw are the following. While Ostrom's theory has serious omissions, it also sheds much needed light on the struggles of Ethiopia's coffee farmers to overcome their poverty. Both the design principles that Ostrom identifies for governance rules and her list of predictors for successful common property resource management institutions suggest that Ethiopia's coffee cooperatives could be in peril. However, by expanding Ostrom's governance framework to incorporate a broader enabling role for governments as well as supportive roles for civic organizations, NGOs, and social movements, we see greater potential for the success of the Oromia Coffee Farmers Cooperative Union.",882898218,,Dissertations & Theses," Holmberg, Susan RuthHolmbergRuthSusanHolmberg, Susan Ruth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2422754821 , 60019101 , 66569 , 9781124766676 , 3465010 , 3465010", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124766676, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/882898218?accountid=14496," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0511 Economic theory , 0560 North African Studies , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0511 Economic theory , 0560 North African Studies , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0511 Economic theory , 0560 North African Studies , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0503 Agricultural economics , 0511 Economic theory , 0560 North African Studies , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Agricultural economics , Economic theory , North African Studies , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Coffee , Collective action , Cooperatives , Ethiopia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Solving+the+%E2%80%9CCoffee+Paradox%E2%80%9D%3A+Understanding+Ethiopia%27s%0Acoffee+cooperatives+through+Elinor+Ostrom%27s+theory+of+the+commons&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Holmberg%2C+Susan+Ruth&amp;isbn=9781124766676&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Redefining Citizenship: Lessons from Environmental Theory, Practice, and Rhetoric","Redefining U.S. citizenship for our current global sociopolitical context is necessary.

Moreover, despite its humble beginnings the steel pan has slowly positioned itself to thrive in the United States. The following study parses out the development of steel pan in America into sections that include an analysis of early steel band influences within Cold War American popular music, the 1950s calypso craze, the New York Carnival scene, Pete Seeger and steel pan as American folk music, the United States Navy Steel Band, early examples of steel band success in academia, steel band's attempt to find a voice and identity within the American popular and commercial music landscape, several individual case studies, and current trends. Despite its unique nature, the steel pan has experienced a fate similar to many other non-western folk instruments; it has been integrated, appropriated, and modified by American practitioners into an entirely new and musical genre, increasingly different in style and character from its Trinidadian roots. The present study further explores the social and artistic phenomenon of steel pan in America and its development over time. The development of steel pan in America is a serious art movement in both social identity and artistic development, and it is my aim to illustrate the motives that propel the scene. Accordingly, every attempt will be made to explore, locate, and provide a historical analysis of the first appearance of steel band music in the United States, drawing links between institutional locations (military bands, school and university programs, recordings/record labels, and more) and regional sites (Harlem, Brooklyn, Dekalb, Illinois) whenever possible. Other avenues of research considered include American steel band's historical links to conflicts with other Trinidadian musical genres (calypso and soca) and black diasporic, and (white) mainstream postwar cultural practices in the United States.

I aim to present an inclusive, transnational account and analysis of anarchist violence in proper context, and I argue that the people who were/are involved in propaganda by the deed cannot be simply classified as terrorists, irrational murderers, or nihilistic vandals. From a geographic perspective, anarchist violence deeply influenced a vast sociopolitical landscape; from the U.S. and Argentina to Western Europe, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire, anarchists left an indelible mark on the development of social movements as well as the coercive state apparatus. Another limitation of existing scholarship is temporal; most studies of anarchism and violence focus on the late 19 th –early 20 th century period when dozens of assassinations and bombings marked the anarchist response to state suppression. This study includes the early period of anarchist violence, as well as its current, global revival. This is a study of firsts, in many ways. It is the first comprehensive study specializing on propaganda by the deed that incorporates elements of historical, sociological, and philosophical analysis at the same time; the first study that attempts to explain the anarchist experience against the state apparatus in the United States, Italy, and the Ottoman empire in a comparative perspective; it is also the first analytical study that suggests a historical and philosophical bond between propaganda by the deed anarchists of the late 19 th and early 20 th century to their descendants in the 21 st century, both in action and in theory. Some of the primary sources used in this study, such as the material on the Ottoman Empire, have never been published before, and see the light of day for the first time. Ultimately, the aim of this study is to move forward the discussion on the complex relationship of violence and individual freedom through an analysis of anarchist violence, past and present.",883089389,,Dissertations & Theses," Corlu, Aksel BoraCorluBoraAkselCorlu, Aksel Bora",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2423446911 , 63524071 , 66569 , 9781124771984 , 3465387 , 3465387", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124771984, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/883089389?accountid=14496," 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history , 0615 Political science"," 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history , 0615 Political science"," 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history , 0615 Political science",," 0506 World History , 0582 Modern history , 0615 Political science"," World History , Modern history , Political science"," Social sciences , Anarchism , Anarchists , Propaganda , Propaganda by the deed , Social movements , Violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+disreputable+phoenix%3A+A+transnational+history+of+propaganda+by+the+deed&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Corlu%2C+Aksel+Bora&amp;isbn=9781124771984&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Local food systems as a strategy for sustainability: Analysis of a scale dependent sustainable urban food system A case study in Philadelphia,"In the heated debate over the meaning of sustainability in a globalizing world, a growing body of scholars and practitioners argue for localization and regionalization as appropriate strategies to achieve sustainability. In parallel, as rapidly globalizing food systems raise questions of environmental degradation, food security, health and nutrition, the local food movement has been arguing for localization and regionalization of the food system as a strategy to counteract the risks and ills of a globalized food system, and to promote sustainability. However, confusion abounds of what constitutes local food systems, and little evidence exists of the capacity of local food systems to significantly support the dietary requirements of major metropolitan areas. Drawing on the fields of sustainability, ecological economics, spatial analysis, regional studies, urban agriculture and social justice, this dissertation is an attempt to address questions of capacity and structure of the local food system in Philadelphia. For this, a conceptual framework for the analysis of local food systems as a strategy for sustainability is developed. The conceptual framework builds on the ecological economics theory argument that there is a fundamental need to acknowledge the natural resource limit for human development and achieve a steady state, or equilibrium in resource consumption and re-generation. Concepts of localization and regionalization in geography, planning, regional and sustainability studies suggest that achieving this type of equilibrium is unlikely at the global scale. Therefore, a more refined study of place and context is required if we are to pursue strategies for sustainability in general and in the case of food systems. In this dissertation the city of Philadelphia is studied to further the knowledge base on local food systems and their potential to promote sustainability in major urban areas. First, socio-spatial analysis is used to study formal and informal components of the local food system and the relationships among them. These include food producing community gardens, institutional gardens, urban farms, educational farms, farmer markets and the farms who supply them, Community Supported Agriculture, local food processing and distribution companies, food retailers and buying clubs that serve the city of Philadelphia. Institutions include city and state government organizations addressing food policy, non-profit organizations and associations dealing with hunger, nutrition, food security, health, education and more. Data is gathered using field research, interviews, and internet resources, analyzed and mapped using ArcGIS. Results define, categorize and map the local food system in Philadelphia as conceptualized and viewed by its participants, and indicate that their interactions in ways of cooperation, sharing of knowledge and resources, and the new economic and social models that arise from their actions, not only define and improve the city's food system, but fundamentally contribute to the sustainability of the city. Next, statistical data and spatial analysis methods are used to calculate the potential for food production in the city and region. Within the urban sphere, infrared aerial photography and other spatial and socio-economic data are utilized, combining remote sensing and GIS techniques to establish land availability and potential for growing food within the city boundaries. At the regional level an ecological economics framework is utilized, analyzing statistical data of land use and agriculture production compared to current food consumption practices and federal dietary guidelines, to evaluate the potential for a semi-closed regional food system to satisfy the dietary requirements of the city. Results show the agriculture hinterland in most of the defined foodshed regions produce enough food to satisfy the dietary requirements of the city. Nonetheless, issues of overlapping foodsheds, competition over local resources and structural social issues complicate the development of a localized food system around major metropolitan areas. Still, while more study is needed, my findings indicate that local food systems are posed to support the development of more sound environmental, social and economic interactions within the urban and food systems, thus positively impacting the sustainability of both the urban and regional sphere.",884221159,,Dissertations & Theses," Kremer, PelegKremerPelegKremer, Peleg",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2428808651 , 63666861 , 66569 , 9781124782423 , 3465799 , 3465799", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124782423, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/884221159?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0999 Urban planning"," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0999 Urban planning"," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0999 Urban planning",," 0366 Geography , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0999 Urban planning"," Geography , Environmental Studies , Urban planning"," Health and environmental sciences , Social sciences , Gis , Local food systems , Philadelphia , Regional food systems , Remote sensing , Urban agriculture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Local+food+systems+as+a+strategy+for+sustainability%3A+Analysis+of+a+scale+dependent+sustainable+urban+food+system+A+case+study+in+Philadelphia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kremer%2C+Peleg&amp;isbn=9781124782423&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Competing futures: War narratives in postwar Japanese architecture 1945–1970,"This dissertation examines the trajectory of postwar Japanese architecture from 1945 to 1970 as a process of overcoming the nation's war legacy. The task of overcoming the war was not restricted to the physical recovery from wartime destruction and postwar ruins but also included the psychological and symbolic process of coming to terms with the recurring memories of this troubled past. Drawing on memory and trauma studies which have emerged as a crucial element in narrating postwar history, this study traces the progression of war narratives in Japanese architecture against the backdrop of Japan's socio-political complexity and the global Cold War context. This dissertation focuses on the tropes of the future which prevailed in Japanese architecture and urbanism during the 1960s because these products of futuristic imagination serve as a rich text through which to discuss the dialectic between forgetting and remembering the war. The dissertation's central argument is that visionary designs for future cities, which accommodated the postwar society's progressive aspirations to build a brave new world, were deeply infiltrated by the traumatic memories of wartime past and a persistent anxiety over nuclear war. In contrast to previous accounts which placed Japan's futuristic projects in tandem with an international context of utopian urbanism and the megastructure movement, this dissertation situates these visionary designs within Japan's changing urban and social landscape and considers them as architects' belated response to Japan's tragic past. One of the objectives of this study is to address the disagreements among key figures in Japanese architecture, including Tange Kenzo, Isozaki Arata, and the Metabolists, in their envisioning of the city of the future. I argue that their diverse and even competing visions of the future, which range from a technocratic utopia (Tange Kenzo) to a ruined future (Isozaki Arata) and the post-apocalyptic world (the Metabolists), resulted from the architects' disparate relationships with the troubled wartime past and continuing Cold War conflict. This dissertation ends with a discussion of Expo'70, commonly known as the ""grand swansong"" of the modern movement and its utopian projects. It posits Expo'70 as the end of postwar architecture, architecture defined by a physical and psychological overcoming of the war legacy, and the beginning of post-postwar architecture, a new paradigm of architecture in an information and postindustrial society.",884234676,,Dissertations & Theses," Cho, HyunjungChoHyunjungCho, Hyunjung",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2428856191 , 63668511 , 66569 , 9781124786919 , 3465963 , 3465963", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124786919, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/884234676?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," Asian Studies , Art history , Architecture"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Expo'70 , Isozaki, Arata , Japan , Japanese architecture , Metabolism , Tange, Kenzo , War memories",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Competing+futures%3A+War+narratives+in+postwar+Japanese+architecture+1945%E2%80%931970&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cho%2C+Hyunjung&amp;isbn=9781124786919&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Representing the Invisible: The American Perceptions of Colonial Korea (1910–1945),"This study argues that American views of Korea during the period of Japanese colonial rule (1910–1945) shaped U.S. policy toward Korea in the colonial period and after, setting the stage for direct U.S. involvement in Korea's post-liberation years after 1945. Korean nationalists perceived the U.S. as a special ally and a model country, and expected it to play a positive role in resolving Korea's colonial status. In fact, American views of Korea in the early twentieth century were mixed, and depended greatly on the respective observers' relationship to Korea—whether as missionary, as scholar, or as diplomat. At the same time, Japan played a crucial role in mediating American views, reflecting the Asia colonizer's interest in winning international approval for its imperialist project. When Korean-American diplomatic relations began in the late nineteenth century, Americans observers typically regarded Korea as an uncivilized but distinct Asian country. This perception of backwardness persisted into the early twentieth century, even as Korea lost its status as a nation-state with the Japanese annexation of 1910. Awareness of Japanese subjugation of Korea would expand significantly in the period 1919–1922, as journalists and missionaries conveyed news of the March First Movement to the American public and Korean nationalists countered Japanese government efforts to influence international opinion. Nationalist efforts to influence U.S. policymaking in the 1920s and 1930s were persistent but never fully successful, in part because of Korean factional rivalries, changing Japanese strategies of colonial control, and American diplomats' desire to protect U.S. colonial interests in the Philippines. Although Korean nationalists failed to accomplish their ultimate goal of participating directly in the U.S. government's wartime discussions on Korea in the early 1940s, they nevertheless succeeded in making the American public aware that Korea was a cultural and racial entity distinct from Japan. This awareness would lay a foundation for American direct intervention in Korean political, social, and military problems after 1945.",885189366,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, JiminKimJiminKim, Jimin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2434995831 , 62892521 , 66569 , 9781124803227 , 3466710 , 3466710", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124803227, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/885189366?accountid=14496, 0332 History, 0332 History, 0332 History,, 0332 History, History," Social sciences , American perception , Colonialism , Japanese Empire , Japanese imperialism , Korea , Korean nationalist movement , March First Movement , US-Korea relations , United States-Korea",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Representing+the+Invisible%3A+The+American+Perceptions+of+Colonial+Korea+%281910%E2%80%931945%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Jimin&amp;isbn=9781124803227&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Conspicuous giving,"When discussing charity, it is important to recognize that charity and other forms of giving are not solely done out of altruism, but can also be done out of greed and self promotion. It is especially important to recognize when those in power or those who have fame participate in this form of giving, because their actions may be emulated by others. This self aggrandizing giving has been done historically throughout multiple cultures as a way to gain or keep prestige, and also as a way to keep the boundaries between the classes strong. This is an important idea because, as I argue, giving as a way to gain public recognition and to keep social boundaries in place is still occurring today. This form of giving is what I label Conspicuous Charity . This is giving in which the main focuses of the participation in charity are the public and social benefits (such as prestige and recognition) to the givers, whereas the assistance to those in need is but a secondary benefit. The conspicuous use of charity also can take a broader approach, which I label Conspicuous Giving . This form of giving is presently being used as a way to keep those with fame, such as media celebrities, in the limelight, those with high standing in the global hierarchy at the top, and those at the top of the racial hierarchy separated from those at the bottom. In order to flesh out the concept of Conspicuous Giving , other forms of giving are also discussed such as Christmas gifts, bribes, and feasting. These cultural events are discussed within the context of multiple cultures as ways to show that using giving in a predatory manner is not a phenomenon unique to Western or even American culture. However, I argue that when it comes to this behavior, Americans are at the forefront of this movement into postmodernity.",885655944,,Dissertations & Theses," Anderson, Lindsay AlexandriaAndersonAlexandriaLindsayAnderson, Lindsay Alexandria",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2437792941 , 63879061 , 66569 , 9781124831657 , 3471187 , 3471187", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124831657, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/885655944?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Celebrity , Charity , Conspicuous giving , Conspicuous thinness , Robber Barons , Veblen, Thorstein",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Conspicuous+giving&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Anderson%2C+Lindsay+Alexandria&amp;isbn=9781124831657&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Translating Desires in Bodhgaya: Buddhism and Development in the Land of Buddha's Enlightenment,"This dissertation is a study of how Buddhism informed development projects as they were emerging in Bodhgaya, located in the Indian state Bihar. Bihar had a national reputation for being corrupt, prone to outbreaks of violence, and for having high rates of illiteracy, poverty, and child mortality. It was thus positioned as a place in dire need of development. In recent years, particularly since the Mahabodhi Temple, the temple marking the site of Buddha's Enlightenment 2500 years ago, was designated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2002, the Bihar state government has sought to intensify international tourism to Bodhgaya as a means to ameliorate Bihar's underdevelopment. Drawing on sixteen months of ethnographic research with Bihari and foreign NGO workers, villagers, streetvendors, foreign Buddhists, and others, this study explores the two varieties of development in Bodhgaya most often discussed and publicized – large-scale projects pursued by the government and grassroots projects pursued by Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). The foremost government project, the City Development Plan for Bodhgaya , was an urban renewal and development plan that envisioned transforming Bodhgaya into something of a Buddhist theme park over a fifty year period, and was developed by a committee of non-local Indian businessmen, government officials from the central and state governments, foreign development experts, and Buddhist monks and ambassadors from Thailand, Myanmar, Tibet, Japan, and Sri Lanka. During my research period the pursuit of this project involved the forced removal of villages, the destruction by paramilitary and police of homes and long-standing local businesses, and the removal of street vendors, all of which were met by vigorous protests. As a counterpoint to the government-led development projects, this study explores how Buddhist practice informed the shape of grassroots development projects pursued through the more than 500 NGOs registered in the Bodhgaya area. I pay particular attention to how conflicts and miscommunications between foreign donors and Bihari NGO staff were constitutive of NGOs as both sites through which Buddhists could pursue socially engaged practice and Biharis could pursue work in a part of India where currency is increasingly needed but wage earning occupations are scarce. So as to illuminate how contemporary power relations in Bodhgaya relate to the ongoing emergence of geographically disperse networks of exchange, this study approaches these varieties of development as a part of the history of Buddhism and the ongoing emergence today of a ""Buddhist world,"" one that has spread, diversified, and been forged and reforged for more than 2000 years. At a moment when much international media attention is given to Islam and Christianity, this perspective, drawing inspiration from postcolonial approaches to history, views Buddhism as a global force of non-European origin mobilizing hundreds of thousands of people, informing international and national policy, and compelling state interventions to facilitate the movement of capital. Through this Buddhist worlding process, a process I approach as an assemblage of historically contingent cultural practices and relations, international connections are forged as national boundaries and local sovereignties are varyingly contested and affirmed in the pursuit and production of desires for such things as modernity and varieties of mobility. In particular, I consider the role of NGO development projects in constituting the form that Buddhist social engagement has taken in Bodhgaya while also being the product of Buddhist desires to pursue social forms of spiritual practice. Further, this theoretical approach helps me to consider the government led tourism project not simply as the inevitable outcome of neoliberal capitalism, hut as a cultural project constituted by a diverse array of cultural processes.",887706737,,Dissertations & Theses," Rodriguez, Jason A.RodriguezA.JasonRodriguez, Jason A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2443885441 , 61084991 , 66569 , 9781124835693 , 3471778 , 3471778", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124835693, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/887706737?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0814 Recreation"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0814 Recreation"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0814 Recreation",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0814 Recreation"," Religion , Cultural anthropology , South Asian Studies , Recreation"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Bodhgaya , Buddhism , India , NGOs , Nongovernmental organizations , Tourism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Translating+Desires+in+Bodhgaya%3A+Buddhism+and+Development+in+the+Land+of+Buddha%27s+Enlightenment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rodriguez%2C+Jason+A.&amp;isbn=9781124835693&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Envisioning Romantic political economy: The formative years of Michel Chevalier (1806–1879),"The French engineer, economist, and publicist Michel Chevalier (1806–1879) was one of the most original and influential intellectuals to have participated in the Saint-Simonian social movement of the 1820s and 1830s. This dissertation situates this largely misunderstood man within the historical context of a changing European world—a world of religious social movements, political upheavals, changing economies, scientific and technological advancements, and Romantic thought. In situating his work in a broader discourse, it examines the connections between the interior logic of Chevalier's writings and deeds and his influence on the political, social, and cultural processes of the nineteenth century. This study argues that Chevalier's intellectual contributions concerning global networks, the Mediterranean world, and the nature of work, industry, and pacifism, were all original and had a real lasting historical influence on France and Europe. As an intellectual biography of his formative years, it draws upon his own manuscript sources, published journals from the period, and it makes extensive use of secondary sources concerning the Saint-Simonians and the world that they inhabited.",887709790,,Dissertations & Theses," Murphy, Michael PeterMurphyPeterMichaelMurphy, Michael Peter",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2443919861 , 64001481 , 66569 , 9781124835709 , 3471779 , 3471779", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124835709, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/887709790?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0335 European history"," 0304 Biographies , 0335 European history"," 0304 Biographies , 0335 European history",," 0304 Biographies , 0335 European history"," Biographies , European history"," Social sciences , Chevalier, Michel , France , Political economy , Romanticism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Envisioning+Romantic+political+economy%3A+The+formative+years+of+Michel+Chevalier+%281806%E2%80%931879%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Murphy%2C+Michael+Peter&amp;isbn=9781124835709&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Borderland Blacks: Rochester, New York and St. Catharines, Ontario, 1850–1860","Borderland Blacks: Rochester, New York and St. Catharines, Ontario, 1850–1860 , explores the struggle of transient Blacks to negotiate space for recourse and self-assertion within the crossroads of two contrasting political realms. The study enhances the historiography by addressing each town within the larger fluid frontier context of the Niagara region. It asserts that Black inhabitants of Rochester and St. Catharines each possessed transnational identities and strategically positioned themselves near the American-Canadian partition where immigration, movement, and interaction occurred. The work contributes to the scholarship of United States and African Diaspora history through its contention that physical separation via formalized national barriers did not sever concepts of psychological memory or restricted social ties. Borderland Blacks is neither uniquely an American story nor separately Canadian, but it unites the nations and people together comprehensively. The study involves complex individuals, who had to negotiate their trans-border identities and the overlapping worlds of the United States, Canada, Great Britain, and the African Diaspora. The lives of Blacks in the borderlands of Rochester and St. Catharines were intertwined by shared newspapers, annual celebrations, religious organizations, as well as kinship and friendship ties that were reinforced by regular border crossings. Although Canada offered greater legal rights, the belief in Black innate inferiority was a transcending sentiment, which transpired in different ways, depending upon location. In all, the objective of this study is to elucidate how the times and terms of emancipation affected Blacks on each side of the border, while demonstrating their political agency to pit the United States and British Canada against one another for the best possible outcomes.",889031750,,Dissertations & Theses," Broyld, Daniel J.BroyldJ.DanielBroyld, Daniel J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2450434561 , 63078341 , 66569 , 9781124826592 , 3468562 , 3468562", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124826592, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/889031750?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0334 Canadian history , 0337 American history"," Black history , Canadian history , American history"," Social sciences , Blacks , New York , Ontario , Rochester , St. Catharines , Transnational identity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Borderland+Blacks%3A+Rochester%2C+New+York+and+St.+Catharines%2C+Ontario%2C+1850%E2%80%931860&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Broyld%2C+Daniel+J.&amp;isbn=9781124826592&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The theoretical construction of literacy at UNESCO, 1974–1987","One of the most urgent needs facing the world today is the eradication of illiteracy currently affecting nearly 800 million of the world's inhabitants. There is a critical need to develop programs which are more effective than ones developed in the past. Time after time, literacy programs, especially at the international level, have failed. These plans have often been founded on ill-conceived ideas about the definitions and purposes of literacy and the processes of literacy conceptualization on which policies are later based. The necessity for reviewing the theoretical landscape of literacy evolved from the elusive goal of a literate world after 50 years of continuous struggle. In order to address this issue, and using a historically framed social movement analysis, I describe and analyze one period at UNESCO, 1974-1987, when literacy theories were evolving at a particularly rapid and dramatic rate. This dissertation elucidates how and why approaches to literacy conceptualization changed during this period and the ways in which literacy was used as a political tool at UNESCO. Specifically, it is an intellectual history of the political use of literacy by the UNESCO Director-General during this era, the Senegalese Amadou Mahtar M'Bow. It examines how M'Bow advanced certain meanings of literacy while suppressing others, and how literacy was tied into his agenda of promoting cultural identity and endogenous development. Director-General M'Bow reconceptualized literacy as being part of a larger movement to establish cultural identity and firmly established a link between literary and cultural development that has remained a central focus of UNESCO literacy policy today.",893158234,,Dissertations & Theses," Lochrie, Kristen N.LochrieN.KristenLochrie, Kristen N.", United Nations Educational Scientific & Cultural Organization, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2464110201 , 64429391 , 66569 , 9781124891897 , 3475656 , 3475656", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124891897, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/893158234?accountid=14496," 0520 Education history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0520 Education history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0520 Education history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations",," 0520 Education history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," Education history , Modern history , International Relations , Literacy , Curriculum development"," Education , Social sciences , Cultural identity , Literacy , UNESCO , United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+theoretical+construction+of+literacy+at+UNESCO%2C+1974%E2%80%931987&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lochrie%2C+Kristen+N.&amp;isbn=9781124891897&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Into the lion's den: Conflict and rhetoric in the book of Daniel,"The book of Daniel has traditionally been seen as a beacon of unwavering faith and inspiration. It is a book in which God appears as both immanent and transcendent, serving as a source of hope for the suffering faithful in times of national and international crisis. Scholarly assessments of the book of Daniel have provided insight into the various kinds of social and political exploitation associated with imperial domination and have begun to uncover some of the practical ways in which oppressed groups during this timeframe could successfully vent their frustration in the face of their own powerlessness. What remains to be more fully explored, however, is how the dominant Hellenistic culture may have fostered conflict among and within the disenfranchised Jewish sub-cultures. This study explores how social conflict and literary rhetoric converge in Daniel to construct a critique of the narrator's own community. To support my thesis, I explore the enigmatic congruence in the social conditions fueling Jewish sectarianism during the late Second Temple Period and the conditions predicating the antithetical discourses of African American religious leaders during the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements in the mid twentieth century. Conflict theory in general, as well as the particular example of the Martin Luther King, Jr.-Malcolm X dissidence, serve as my hermeneutical lens for illustrating inner communal conflict in the book of Daniel.",893660111,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith, Terry AnnSmithAnnTerrySmith, Terry Ann",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2465729581 , 64453911 , 66569 , 9781124895345 , 3475789 , 3475789", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124895345, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/893660111?accountid=14496," 0321 Biblical studies , 0325 Black studies , 0344 Social research"," 0321 Biblical studies , 0325 Black studies , 0344 Social research"," 0321 Biblical studies , 0325 Black studies , 0344 Social research",," 0321 Biblical studies , 0325 Black studies , 0344 Social research"," Biblical studies , Black studies , Social research"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Book of Daniel , Jewish sectarianism , Social conflicts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Into+the+lion%27s+den%3A+Conflict+and+rhetoric+in+the+book+of+Daniel&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+Terry+Ann&amp;isbn=9781124895345&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Invisible Prison: Art, Collectivity, and Protest in 1960s France","This dissertation investigates the attempts by artists in France to formulate a political role for art prior to, during, and immediately following the May 1968 student-worker revolutionary movement. In particular, it focuses on those activities in which artists experimented with collective forms of art-making in the hopes of connecting with a broader public. The different ways in which formerly unexamined groups such as the Salon de la Jeune Peinture, the Groupe de Recherche d'Art Visuel (GRAV), and the Atelier Populaire rejected traditional criteria of artistic value are considered and compared to other, more well-known groups, such as the Situationist International and the Nouveau Réalistes. Of central importance is the priority placed by these artists on the public space of the street as the possible site of a collective entity beyond the divisions and determinations of institutions. Rejecting the twin notions that the visual culture of May '68 was a spontaneous creation of the movement itself and that formal and epistemological radicality was the only appropriate artistic response to the political, social, and economic changes of the 1960s, this dissertation insists on the distinct, though often problematic, connections between forms of popular protest and the work and concerns of certain artists of the period. The dissertation recounts the trajectories of the Salon de la Jeune Peinture and GRAV during the 1960s as they each formulated particular ideas, production methods, and visual styles that critiqued notions of individual expression and aesthetic value. The third chapter assesses the work of the Atelier Populaire, the revolutionary poster workshop organized by artists in the occupied School of Fine Arts in Paris during May–June 1968. An epilogue focuses on the Souffles , a collectively produced sculptural installation organized by Jeune Peinture and Atelier Populaire participant, Gérard Fromanger in October 1968.",894261572,,Dissertations & Theses," Siegelbaum, SamiSiegelbaumSamiSiegelbaum, Sami",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2469554761 , 59556781 , 66569 , 9781124869247 , 3472950 , 3472950", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124869247, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/894261572?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0377 Art history"," 0335 European history , 0377 Art history"," 0335 European history , 0377 Art history",," 0335 European history , 0377 Art history"," European history , Art history"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , 1960s , France , May 1968 , Nineteen 60s , Political art , Protest , Public space",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Invisible+Prison%3A+Art%2C+Collectivity%2C+and+Protest+in+1960s+France&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Siegelbaum%2C+Sami&amp;isbn=9781124869247&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Depopulation and education in a Mexican migrant town: Schools in Villa Juarez, San Luis Potosi, 1942-2000","While educational systems have been governed by the policies of the nation-state and have been contained within state borders, the transformations brought about by the economic, social, and political repercussions of globalization have added layers of complexity to issues in education. This is true in particular of agrarian communities, such as Villa Juarez, San Luis Potosi, Mexico. National educational policies have led to new challenges in agrarian societies as they undergo not only ideological exchanges but the movement of populations that have led to international and national demographic shifts. One of the main issues that this research will investigate is the relationship between education and migration, and whether the changing conditions of that rural setting have had any effect on how locals perceive the purpose of education. This study examines the way teachers, students and government officials view the purpose of education in the agrarian village of Villa Juarez that, like other communities in central Mexico, is undergoing the influence of globalization, manifested most notably in emigration to the United States. If post-basic education competes with international migration as another form of economic mobility, as William A. Kandel discusses in his study of traditional migrant communities, then what is the purpose of education as viewed by teachers, students and government officials in a rural community? Villa Juarez, a town with a long-standing history of migration to the United States, has experienced continually diminishing depopulation and school closings since the Bracero Program of 1942, which marked the onset of a pronounced trend of migration to the United States for temporary employment opportunities. The effects of a culture of migration and globalization on education in the municipality and town of Villa Juarez have led to the undermining of education as a vehicle to social and economic mobility for future generations of students.",894267279,,Dissertations & Theses," Banda, MagdaBandaMagdaBanda, Magda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2469591911 , 62142651 , 66569 , 9781124864044 , 3469945 , 3469945", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124864044, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/894267279?accountid=14496, 0458 Education Policy, 0458 Education Policy, 0458 Education Policy,, 0458 Education Policy," Education Policy , School systems , Towns , Aliens , Population , Hispanic culture , History , San Luis Potosi Mexico"," Education , Depopulation , Education , Mexico , Migration",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Depopulation+and+education+in+a+Mexican+migrant+town%3A+Schools+in+Villa+Juarez%2C+San+Luis+Potosi%2C+1942-2000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Banda%2C+Magda&amp;isbn=9781124864044&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Vietnamese adoptee narratives of saving, trafficking, activism and multiculturalism","The Vietnamese Adoptee Narratives of Saving, Trafficking, Activism and Multiculturalism investigates a group of Vietnamese born during the Vietnam War and adopted into Western families.

They joined approximately 1,000 more children who were adopted during the war. These children were largely adopted by white parents. As adults, these adoptees have been telling personal stories about race, adoption, and war, as well as commenting on international adoption, Western humanitarianism and multicultural families and the racial, social, and cultural contexts of their lives. The dissertation draws on social movement theories of narrative to look at more micro processes of the racial formation framework.

Although monumental social and political challenges remain in confronting integration of the Muslim population and for achieving greater acceptance of Islam within the Italian public sphere, the evidence suggests that the process for integration has slowly begun. Additionally, this study examines the intellectual framework of the existing literature which addresses the issues impacting Muslim integration in Northern Italy. This issue has induced new debates within Italy on multiculturalism, national identity, human rights, while more importantly raising the question—“to what extent do we allow Muslim integration into Italian society and the further insertion of Islam into Italy’s spiritual geography?” This study argues that the convergence of contemporary international affairs with religion calls for a new lens for interaction. In Italy the events following 9/11, combined with a resurgence of Islamophobia and the impact of the Global War on Terror, have drawn the issue of Muslim immigrants into a negative spotlight. Mainstream attitudes in Europe, following 9/11, have generated a rift in Muslim-West relations and have caused confusion and anxiety among Muslims and non-Muslims alike. The research hypothesis for this thesis suggests that there are multiple factors impeding the efforts for Muslims to achieve equal footing within the Italian religious landscape and inclusion within Italian society. Among these are divisions found within the Muslim community itself, a growing mistrust of Islam in mainstream Italian society, sponsored by negative media stereotyping and xenophobic political movements, and underlying everything else, the privileged position of the Catholic Church and its unwillingness to accommodate Islamic identity within the social framework. The chosen methodology employed in this study is qualitative, theoretical contextual analysis combined with interviews plus questionnaires used to construct a case study were applied. Beyond engaging in seven interviews with the 2 nd generation Italian Muslims, this study was informed by the relevant academic literature from the fields of conflict resolution, history, sociology, cultural studies, Islamic studies and political science. Finally this study contextualized the dynamics generating this conflict and examined the discontinuities this situation has created in the lives of Muslims in Italy. The exclusion of the Muslim population, coupled with the complex relationship between this cultural group and state, has led to the exploration within Italy of different models for integration. The findings of this study indicate that inequalities exist for the Muslim population of Northern Italy in their relation with the host nation and society. This further hampers the process of integration and generates further exclusion. Only profound rethinking of the Italian approach to integration will serve to adequately meet the needs of this marginalized population and fully incorporate them within Italian society.",897926155,,Dissertations & Theses," Migliore, Joseph AnthonyMiglioreAnthonyJosephMigliore, Joseph Anthony",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2484230291 , 64049411 , 66569 , 9781124908205 , 1500069 , 1500069", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124908205, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/897926155?accountid=14496," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0601 International Relations",," 0512 Islamic Studies , 0601 International Relations"," Islamic Studies , International Relations"," Social sciences , Conflict resolution , Cultural barriers , Intercultural conflict , Islamophobia , Italian landscape , Muslim identity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Cultural+Barriers+to+Integration+of+Second+Generation+Muslims+in%0ANorthern+Italy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Migliore%2C+Joseph+Anthony&amp;isbn=9781124908205&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Decolonizing Christianity: Grassroots ecumenism in France and Algeria, 1940–1965","This dissertation, “Grassroots Ecumenism: Christianity and Decolonization in France and Algeria, 1940-1965” is the first major study of how French Protestant and Catholic engagement in the Algerian War of Independence (1954-1962) reshaped Christianity in the modern world and influenced global religious movements like Ecumenical Movement and Vatican II. The moral questions that surfaced during the Algerian War, including the French military’s use of torture, the repression of civilian populations, and debates about the legitimacy of the Algerian nationalist positions forced Christians across the world to rethink the role of Christianity in imperialism and its future in a postcolonial world. This dissertation examines the shifting dynamics of Christianity’s role in the French empire, from the role that Christianity played in supporting the moral foundations for French colonialism in Algeria, to the ways in which Social Christianity, which emerged in France in the 1930s and 40s, undermined these same moral arguments, including the belief that French colonialism was both benevolent and the only means through which Christian interests could be protected in Algeria. Using private and governmental archives from France, Switzerland, Algeria, and Tunisia, this dissertation argues that the Algerian War, the most brutal and violent conflict over decolonization in the French empire, was a testing ground for the decolonization of Christianity itself. It traces a group of French Christians who used Christian theology and morality to argue for social justice for colonized peoples, and even political independence. Although many of these Christians were arrested and tortured for their support of the Algerian population, they worked toward a decolonization of the church in Algeria by initiating a dialogue with Algerian Muslims and working with them to solve some of the grave social problems that were at the root of Algerian discontent. This project thus traces the transformation of Christianity from its position as the moral foundation of European imperialism to its role as a radical voice of political and social change in the era of decolonization, and the complex tensions that resulted as Christians attempted to renegotiate their place in the emerging Third World.",899226730,,Dissertations & Theses," Fontaine, Darcie S.FontaineS.DarcieFontaine, Darcie S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2490155951 , 64822041 , 66569 , 9781124924441 , 3475023 , 3475023", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124924441, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/899226730?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0331 African history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0320 Religious history , 0331 African history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," 0320 Religious history , 0331 African history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history",," 0320 Religious history , 0331 African history , 0335 European history , 0582 Modern history"," Religious history , African history , European history , Modern history , Christianity , Grass roots movement , Ecumenism , France , Algeria"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Algeria , Christianity , Colonialism , Decolonization , Ecumenism , France , North Africa , World War II",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Decolonizing+Christianity%3A+Grassroots+ecumenism+in+France+and+Algeria%2C+1940%E2%80%931965&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fontaine%2C+Darcie+S.&amp;isbn=9781124924441&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""State, civil society, and food insecurity in post-Apartheid Johannesburg","This dissertation focuses on two main research goals. First, this study identifies the institutional roles that the South African state, civil society, and private sector play in procuring food security in Johannesburg. Although each sector of South African society provides food security services in some capacity, little research has been completed which actually delineates the size, scope, and geography of the food security sector in Johannesburg. Second, this research delineates the key processes transforming the South African state's relationship with food security and hunger focused NGOs and CBOs in Johannesburg, including increased governmental and private sector presence in service provisioning, profound resources crisis for civil society organizations, and introduction of American food banking models into South Africa, in the form of FoodBank South Africa and its local subsidiary, FoodBank Johannesburg. It is expected that these key processes have transformed the food security sector in Johannesburg since the fall of Apartheid in 1994; yet, it is unknown how, if at all, these powerful forces have affected food security organizations in Johannesburg. To achieve these research goals, multiple methods are used including surveys, in-depth interviews, seven month participant observation, quantitative data analysis, and GIS-based spatial analysis. Findings indicate that three global, regional, and local processes have combined to transform the South African state's relationship with food security focused NGOs (non-governmental organizations) and CBOs (community based organizations) in post-Apartheid Johannesburg. These three multi-scalar processes include the financial and human resource crisis among post-Apartheid civil society, reemergence of the South African central state in food security programming, and introduction of American food banking models into South Africa. First, data analysis reveals that resources in the food security sector are unevenly available by geographic location. While survey data reveal that more organizations are located in inner city locations, wealthier White, suburban locations tend to have much larger, privately resourced organizations. In contrast, Black, inner city locations tend to have a mix of NGOs and CBOs with medium-sized budgets resourced from the private sector and other funding, not government funding. Also, Black, informal settlement and township locations tend to have smaller, governmentally resourced organizations with higher turnover rates. Moreover, there are significant gaps in human resource availability, as organizations in non-suburban areas often have few to no paid staff or volunteers. Second, the reconsolidation of South African central state power has shaped civil society's access to funding, program priorities, and relations with government. This has been exacerbated by the central state's uncoordinated approach to food security policy, lack of attention to urban food security, and disconnectedness from ""on the ground realities."" Third, the globalization of the American food banking model into South Africa has transformed NGOs and CBOs through processes of inclusion and exclusion and legitimized a top-down approach towards food security which privileges particular food security interventions over others. While FoodBank Johannesburg has streamlined food donation processes, increased the amount of food delivered, and reduced waste, it has the potential to depoliticize hunger, create new bureaucracies, and allow government to shirk responsibilities towards the food insecure. In addition, the underdevelopment of ""right to food"" social movements in Johannesburg has limited the politicization of NGO and CBO service delivery and therefore minimized the potential for more progressive state policies to develop in South Africa. Even though South Africa has one of the most politically active civil societies in the world, no substantial food security and hunger focused social movements currently exist in Johannesburg due to limited financial and human resource capacity, lack of a consistent political rallying point, and focus on building social service structures. While some scholars of urban development conceptualize the South African state-civil society problematic as one of limited civil society autonomy, others theorize these new relationships as an explicit co-optation of civil society organizations by the state and part of a broader political agenda to limit their activism and restrict their role to social service delivery. According to this latter approach, civil society inclusive of NGOs, CBOs, and social movements is assumed to work in opposition to the state, and hence the state's need to curtail its autonomy. In the case of the food security sector in Johannesburg, I contend that civil society is not simply opposed to the central state; the landscape of relationships is far more complex, and includes NGOs working in collaboration with capital as well as CBOs and social movements that operate independently of capital or state partnerships. For some NGOs, institutional stability has been ensured by changing organizational mission, accessing private sector funding, or joining forces with FoodBank Johannesburg. Yet, for many NGOs and CBOs, resource unavailability, ineffective governmental policy, and new food bank bureaucracies portend an uncertain future.

Two of the moments discussed here took place when Korea was a colony of Japan: a so-called “conspiracy case” in 1911 and the 1919 independence movement. The other two moments transpired in the context of the Cold War when Korean orphans and Korean exchange students came to the United States in the 1950s. In recounting these stories, I seek, not so much to chronicle state actions or the work of formal policy-makers but rather to analyze the experiences of Americans and Koreans who encountered each other outside the circles of foreign policy elites and the effects of those encounters. I argue that the interplay of perceptions, people , and official and unofficial policy can be seen in the work of people such as missionaries, mission board members, Korean expatriates, adoptive parents, social workers, journalists, and academics who tried to bind Americans and Koreans through empathetic connections. They did so by portraying Koreans as Christian converts, as supporters of democracy and democratic ideals, and as people embracing western or American cultural norms, including language, schooling, dress, and morals. In molding American perceptions of Koreans, the actors in this dissertation attempted to influence U.S. and Korean relations. They did not always succeed in their goals but, through their endeavors, they facilitated policy discussions, forged ties between the United States and Korea, and began to break down cultural barriers between Koreans and Americans.",903972769,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, HannahKimHannahKim, Hannah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2511652291 , 65581931 , 66569 , 9781124965680 , 3478737 , 3478737", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781124965680, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/903972769?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations",," 0332 History , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," History , American history , Modern history , International Relations"," Social sciences , Cold War , Intercountry adoption-Korea , International adoption , Korea , Korea - Japanese colony , Korean independence movement , Protestant missions , Protestant missions - Korea , U.S.-Korea foreign relations , United States-Korea",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ties+that+bind%3A+People%2C+policy%2C+and+perception+in+U.S.-Korean+relations%2C+1905%E2%80%931965&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Hannah&amp;isbn=9781124965680&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Dignity and Dalit Social Imaginaries: Entanglements of Caste, Class, and Space in Mumbai, 1898–1982","The project studies the long history of dalit (former untouchables) engagement with modernity in the city of Mumbai in the late-colonial and postcolonial periods. The work investigates dalit encounters with processes and institutions of modernity. It focuses on the transformative imaginations of dalit social movements created in the crucible of modern urban life and emphasizes the relevance of dignity for these imaginations. It envisages dignity ( svabhiman, svavalamban, pratishtha ) as a keyword to examine how dalits navigated life in the city of Mumbai. The project tracks changing notions of dignity in diverse narratives about dalits to understand the historical conjunctures, collective identities, and political cultures that were produced in the city. I argue that dignity is not only an important concept to understand how dalits made sense of their world and strove to transform it, but also that the concept opens a fresh perspective to map how the State, liberal nationalists, political radicals, social reformers, artistes, and intellectuals negotiated the question of ""socially marginalized communities"" in modern India. To demonstrate the relevance of dignity in understanding the social lives of dalits in the city, the chapters of the dissertation highlight its iterations in the politics and practices of housing and urban space, in the crafting of a dalit public sphere in the colonial period, in dalit engagement with leftist trade unions in the city that focused on solidarities of class and ignored differences of caste, and the efforts of dalit writers to create a literary canon in dialogue with global bodies of emancipatory and radical literatures. The work contributes to our understanding of the webs of power within which marginalized groups were suspended and the acts of imagination through which these groups located themselves in the city and reshaped its institutions, its social life, and its public culture.",906493294,,Dissertations & Theses," Shaikh, Juned Noor M.ShaikhNoor M.JunedShaikh, Juned Noor M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2522564621 , 65820711 , 66569 , 9781267032430 , 3485548 , 3485548", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267032430, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/906493294?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history"," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history"," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history",," 0332 History , 0582 Modern history"," History , Modern history"," Social sciences , Dalit , Housing , India , Mumbai , Public sphere , Trade unions",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dignity+and+Dalit+Social+Imaginaries%3A+Entanglements+of+Caste%2C+Class%2C+and+Space+in+Mumbai%2C+1898%E2%80%931982&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shaikh%2C+Juned+Noor+M.&amp;isbn=9781267032430&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""America, Britain, and the geography of decolonization","This study explores Anglo-American diplomacy during the decolonization of Palestine and Kashmir. It emphasizes the role of mental geographies—cognitive maps of the territorial and human geography of particular regions that share certain common denominators—in shaping American and British policymakers' perceptions of anticolonial nationalism and their reactions to specific self-determination struggles. It shows how the mental geography of American ""globalism,"" necessitating a worldwide postwar basing presence and national security policy, naturally led the U.S. State Department to develop provisional plans for international trusteeship and global refugee resettlement after the Second World War. These plans helped give rise to Departmental support for the resettlement of European Jews in Palestine well before the influence of President Truman and advisors like Clark Clifford and David Niles came to bear on U.S. policy toward Zionism, and in stark contrast to the Arabist opposition to allow European Jews to seek refuge in Palestine that pervaded the Department's Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs. Globalism also saw the creation of Pakistan out of British India as a bulwark against the expansion of Soviet Communist influence into the Indian subcontinent, influencing Washington's policy toward the Kashmir dispute at the United Nations in early 1948. In stark contrast, the British Foreign and Colonial Offices saw Palestine and Kashmir through the lens of a mental geography of ""regionalism,"" one that saw both flashpoints as opposite ends of the heart of the British Empire‘s strategic lines of communication, what Lord Milner called a ""great Moslem block lying between the Bosporus and the Indus."" While the core assumptions of regionalism reinforced lukewarm American support for the Pakistani position in the Kashmir dispute, it clashed acrimoniously with U.S. support for the Zionist cause, holding that the plights of Muslims in Palestine and Kashmir were inextricably tied, and that a policy arousing Muslim ire at either end of the crescent of Islam that spanned Southwest Asia could rapidly spread to the other. The study concludes with a discussion of how the resolution of the competing prerogatives of globalism and regionalism shaped the history of decolonization in Palestine and Kashmir. In Palestine, David Ben-Gurion's Zionism had arisen as a compelling conception of Jewish nationalist thought in stark contrast to the rational humanism of Hans Kohn's ""cultural Zionism"" and Hannah Arendt's characterization of the Jew as a social ""pariah"" striving for social justice as s/he grappled with modernity. Similarly, Muhammad Ali Jinnah's idea of Pakistan had emerged from a social-Darwinistic struggle with competitors of its own in the Congress Party's embrace of a multi-confessional India and the pan-Islamism of the Khilafat movement in the early 1920s. The resolution of the competing imperatives of globalism and regionalism, as reflected in the strategies of American and British diplomats and generals, shaped institutions like the United Nations Security and Trusteeship Councils and profoundly altered the historical trajectories of both these nationalist struggles, helping Ben-Gurion and Jinnah realize the territorialization of their nationalist aims in the ultimate, cataclysmic conferral of national independence. Ultimately, British regionalism provided the rationale for a willing imperial retreat from positions east of Suez. It came to be displaced by an American globalism that, though inchoate and ill-defined, expanded rapidly to displace the Pax Britannica it superseded. In the process, the ""acid"" of British re-occupation and the ""solvent"" of American anti-colonialism helped ""corrode"" some of the imperial residues that remained in the postwar world like the Francophone Levant and the Dutch East Indies. In contrast to the sober realism that underpinned British regionalism, a stubborn reluctance to recalibrate imperial footprints lay bare the harsh realities of European imperial overstretch in the altered world order.",909969334,,Dissertations & Theses," Husain, AiyazHusainAiyazHusain, Aiyaz",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2532461891 , 63565181 , 66569 , 9781267027535 , 3482173 , 3482173", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267027535, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/909969334?accountid=14496," 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations",," 0582 Modern history , 0601 International Relations"," Modern history , International Relations"," Social sciences , Britain , Decolonization , Diplomacy , India , Israel , Kashmir , Pakistan , Palestine",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=America%2C+Britain%2C+and+the+geography+of+decolonization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Husain%2C+Aiyaz&amp;isbn=9781267027535&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Visceral Logics: Revolution of Feeling and the All-India Progressive Writers Association,"From its earliest inception, the field of postcolonial studies has attempted to theorize the violence of colonialism as enacted on the mind and body of the colonized subject. While the enduring trauma of this violence remains an insistent preoccupation for theorists of empire and nationalism, I would argue that what consistently evades scholarly inquiries into colonized subjectivities is the emotive interface between the psyche and the soma. In my dissertation, I suggest that at the crux of this problem is the way in which postcolonial reading practices implicitly rest upon rationalist dichotomies of thinking and feeling, eclipsing an interrogation of colonial feeling as a constitutive dimension of colonized thinking. It is with this problematic in view that I return to a neglected archive of anti-colonial writers whose literature, I demonstrate, aids us in excavating the emotive dimensions of colonial discipline. My dissertation centers on the All-India Progressive Writers Association (PWA), a Marxist-oriented literary group that was central to animating debates surrounding the decolonization of the national consciousness in India from the 1930s through the 1950s. By drawing on theories of affect to probe the emotive figures in the fiction of these authors, I argue that what is latent in the corporeal poetics of the Progressive Writers is an exploration of how colonial ideologies are naturalized through the involuntary visceral reflexes of the body. Established in London in 1935 and composed primarily of writers of English, Hindi, and Urdu, the PWA consisted of Indian authors who shared a commitment to literature as a source of transformation for the Indian nation. I argue that their movement cannot be isolated from both the transnational Marxist movements against imperialism and fascism, and their artistic ties with European modernist movements, of which they saw themselves a pail. By attending to the transnational influences through which Marxist discourses of the body are mobilized and re-signified in the poetics of these postcolonial imaginings, I reveal how the fiction of the Progressive Writers became the creative staging ground for the group's interrogation of colonial affect. For example, exploring their social realist experiments in the Indian English novel, my first two chapters examine the aesthetic inquiries of Mulk Raj Anand and K.A. Abbas into the possibility of transforming the colonized body: the revolutionary possibility of what Anand calls ""the feeling of new feelings."" These chapters thus foreground one of the central problematics of the Progressive Writers movement: What is the role of literature and art in disrupting and reconditioning the emotive matrices and visceral logics that sustain the projects of empire? Chapter three re-casts these debates in light of the feminist Urdu fiction of Ismat Chughtai, whose sensory experiments in realist prose intervened into PWA debates by making visible the violent disciplining of the female body that structure discourses of national ""progress"" and postcolonial modernity. Throughout these chapters, I argue that the question of what defined social realist literature as ""progressive"" for the PWA in a decolonizing India brings to light the group's dynamic aesthetic grapplings with what would constitute revolutionary feelings and the revolution of feeling. My dissertation thus examines the diverse aesthetic modes through which the writers of the PWA imagined decolonization in their literature as a revolution of consciousness predicated on a radical transformation of the emotive life of the colonized body. My investment in this archive lies in my scholarly commitments to the goals of postcolonial and South Asian studies; for, if our intellectual practices are aimed at decolonizing the lingering habits of colonial thought and dismantling the racist ideologies that uphold them, I contend that we must be able to engage the affects through which these enduring colonial logics have taken root. Drawing this forgotten literary group into the debates of postcolonial studies thus enables a deeper exploration of the legacy of India's violent colonial and postcolonial histories, kept alive in the sensibilities of its national and diasporic communities.",910228374,,Dissertations & Theses," Khanna, NeetuKhannaNeetuKhanna, Neetu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2533905091 , 64515281 , 66569 , 9781267050281 , 3486556 , 3486556", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267050281, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/910228374?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Comparative literature , Asian literature , British and Irish literature , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , Affect , All-India Progressive Writers Association , India , P.W.A. , Postcolonial , Progressive writers , South Asia , Visceral",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Visceral+Logics%3A+Revolution+of+Feeling+and+the+All-India+Progressive+Writers+Association&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khanna%2C+Neetu&amp;isbn=9781267050281&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Whose Streets? Paving the Right to the City,"This dissertation explores the conditions under which New York City's streets, beginning in 2006, became a target for the city government's ""sustainability"" goals. Long famous for their unique quality of public life, from the 1920s, a gradual shift to automobile-centric urban planning began to eliminate streets' social multi-functionality. These early decisions re-designating the public domain for private, motorized movement cemented a long generation of sunk infrastructural costs and lost productivity down economic roads too congested and unpleasant to travel. Following this story's tracks through to contemporary New York City, through interviews, participant observation, and secondary analysis, the project examines the political and economic circumstances that accelerated the automobile's local habitat loss, and how this is related to competing visions for the City's future. Even as automobility was still firmly cemented in the street systems and growth models of most US cities, how did human-scaled mobility planning become so immediately visible in the streets of New York? This dissertation illustrates the changing terms and stakes of wielding power through infrastructural transformation. In it, I demonstrate how economic elites, government technocrats, and historically marginal social movement actors mobilized a common entrepreneurial agenda to preserve New York's global city status.

Census records, literacy narratives, editorials and government reports verify the scale of this movement in the black community at the turn of the century. I will explore the potential for literacy myths to be ""transformed and redirected,"" as Harvey Graff argues in his reflection on The Literacy Myth . Factors such as the impact of a history of oppression, unequal access to education, and the activism of the A.M.E. church have shaped a revolutionary moral basis of literacy within the black community in ways that have been typically misunderstood. Despite the dominant cultural myth which claims that literacy can bring about economic and social uplift, marginalized people have long been aware of literacy's limited potential to facilitate economic empowerment. For example, the nationwide debate over the need to teach Greek and Latin in black common schools demonstrates the contradictory nature of our mainstream literacy myth. African Americans' forward-thinking literacy ideology, which took literacy's contradictions into account, made way for a visionary writing practice that galvanized the black community for the purpose of bringing about social change. The history of the African-American quest for literacy and freedom during the Progressive Era, 1890–1919, presents a story of literacy's role in African Americans' struggle for self-determination and self-definition. This history has informed African-American literacy practices as well as the way literacy has operated as a rhetorical object in black scholarly and popular writing. Following the work of Literacy Studies scholars Deborah Brandt, Katie Clinton, and Jacqueline Jones Royster, I also explore the tensions inherent within a literacy myth that seeks to intervene in the global forces and local circumstances that mediate access to and the usefulness of the act of reading and writing.",911054356,,Dissertations & Theses," Bibbs, Maria L.BibbsL.MariaBibbs, Maria L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2538313671 , 63814941 , 66569 , 9781267054852 , 3488549 , 3488549", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267054852, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/911054356?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0328 Black history , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0328 Black history , 0681 Rhetoric",," 0328 Black history , 0681 Rhetoric"," Black history , Rhetoric"," Social sciences , Language, literature and linguistics , African-Americans , Literacy , Progressive Era",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+African+American+literacy+myth%3A++Literacy%27s+ethical+objective+during+the+Progressive+Era%2C+1890-1919&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bibbs%2C+Maria+L.&amp;isbn=9781267054852&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The health of empires: Health practices and expansion in the Texas borderlands, 1780-1861","This dissertation connects the history of health in Texas to a broader, transnational history of multicultural encounters, colonialism, slavery, and nation building in North America. It does so from the perspective of the Spanish and, later, U.S.–Mexico borderlands, where Native Americans, Spain, Mexico, and the U.S. vied for dominance. Government structures and functions were weak in the region, so that diverse peoples met and negotiated political, economic, and social control of the space. The study traces subsistence practices and bouts with illnesses in various contexts to show how health concerns and cultural practices informed colonial expansion, nation-state formation, and slavery. Diverse health and healing customs shaped social, economic, and political relations between residents and newcomers, Native peoples and the state, and physicians and lay healers. I argue that Spaniards, ethnic Mexicans, Comanche and Karankawa Indians, African Americans, and westering Anglo Americans helped negotiate the colonization of Texas, as their health concerns intersected with agricultural and economic practices and with state-sponsored initiatives, such as geographical expansion, land distribution, and public health. Epidemic disease, medical treatment, and food habits, for example, shaped Spanish and Comanche imperialism. Spaniards traveled to obtain medical care and to conduct vaccination programs, reinforcing Spanish imperial claims in northern New Spain, as such mobility linked colonial settlements and tied Spaniards to the land. Comanches' meat-rich diet likewise triggered movement throughout the region. Comanches hunted for food and raided for livestock and captives, feeding Comanche expansion and participation in the regional economy. In south Texas, Karankawa Indian struggles to hold and gain access to land in the face of Mexican, Irish, and Anglo encroachment partly revolved around their need to produce and access ritual healing space. Finally, Mexican and U.S. officials constructed their respective nations around particular notions of health and healing, excluding unhealthy, racial ""inferiors"" who practiced unorthodox forms of healing from the imagined polity. Facing epidemic cholera and scurvy, however, Mexican and Anglo physicians and state authorities came to rely on marginalized populations for medical knowledge in order to heal citizens and, in turn, serve the nation.",912378289,,Dissertations & Theses," Goldberg, Mark AllanGoldbergAllanMarkGoldberg, Mark Allan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2545546981 , 63839691 , 66569 , 9781267065599 , 3488729 , 3488729", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267065599, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/912378289?accountid=14496, 0337 American history, 0337 American history, 0337 American history,, 0337 American history, American history," Social sciences , Colonial expansion , Disease epidemics , Subsistence , Texas",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+health+of+empires%3A++Health+practices+and+expansion+in+the+Texas+borderlands%2C+1780-1861&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goldberg%2C+Mark+Allan&amp;isbn=9781267065599&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Politics of Everyday Life: Non-Party Leftists in Republican China, 1919-1937","My dissertation examines the ways in which ""everyday life"" was conceptualized by prominent leftist intellectuals and culture workers in their quest to define a democratic present and future from the 1919 May Fourth Movement to the Japanese invasion in 1937. Drawing upon archival collections of journals and magazines in China and the United States, I investigate how radical leftists, who were not directly affiliated with the Communist Party but who espoused leftist democratic sympathies, thought about everyday life in ways that distinctly differed from the thinking of the Marxist-Communist and the Nationalist Party activists who dominated China's interwar political scene. My study situates the relationship of everyday life and radical leftism as it emerged during the interwar period in a transnational arena by calling attention to the concurrent political configurations of ""everyday life"" and ""the masses"" in Euro-America and Japan. Ultimately, my study challenges prevailing interpretations of intellectual concern for everyday life in 1920s/30s China by demonstrating how its significance to Chinese leftists as an important local form of politics and activism informed their struggles against global fascism, imperialism, and for a democratic future of human emancipation. This intellectual-cultural history project not only considers the writings of well-known leftist activists, but also those of anonymous Chinese citizens who analyzed and mobilized against exploitation, fascism, state-party domination and the impending Japanese invasion. My dissertation begins by assessing how these figures emphasized the importance of everyday life to overcoming feudal-, imperialist-, and capitalist-imposed structural impediments to the realization of a democratic polity. Diaries, short stories, and visual works such as cartoons, woodcut print, and photographs by ordinary Chinese compiled in the 1936 project ""China's One Day"" form the basis of chapter one. I evaluate how systematic, locally-organized social movements to transform everyday life sought to foster a simultaneously global and national project of mass revolution against imperialism, fascism, and patriarchy. I further draw upon previously-neglected publications to show how radical democratic values--equality, human rights, freedom and mass politics--became the foundation of leftwing emancipatory activism and the basis of mobilizing the masses for a non-party democratic form of politics.",912749572,,Dissertations & Theses," Zhu, QianZhuQianZhu, Qian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2547949171 , 66451171 , 66569 , 9781267050052 , 3486844 , 3486844", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267050052, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/912749572?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0453 Womens studies , 0506 World History"," 0332 History , 0453 Womens studies , 0506 World History"," 0332 History , 0453 Womens studies , 0506 World History",," 0332 History , 0453 Womens studies , 0506 World History"," History , Womens studies , World History"," Social sciences , China's one day , Everyday life , Non-party leftism , Republican China , The masses",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Politics+of+Everyday+Life%3A+Non-Party+Leftists+in+Republican+China%2C+1919-1937&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zhu%2C+Qian&amp;isbn=9781267050052&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Renewal and transformation in Grace Communion International (formerly Worldwide Church of God),"This dissertation focuses on the renewal that has taken place in Worldwide Church of God (WCG), a denomination that experienced so far-reaching a renewal that a new name, Grace Communion International (GCI), was required to reflect its new realities. The research shows that members now have a new understanding of who God is, who they are and what their purpose in life is. This, in turn, has led to new administrative structures and a desire to engage the larger culture in new ways. The dissertation proposes three areas of special focus, which can become the foundation for a curriculum to equip pastors in the Caribbean to be able to further anchor and advance the benefits of the renewal. The research employed in this study utilizes qualitative data methodology, employing semi-structured interviews and participant observation for data collection. Data analysis led to the generation of hypotheses as to how lessons learned through participants in the renewal can be used to shape and target the equipping process for pastors. A secondary focus is on contextual issues within the Caribbean that pastors need to be equipped to effectively deal with. Review of literature in four fields—church renewal, social movement theory, Trinitarian theology and leadership—informed and supplemented the research process. After a thorough analysis of the research, the results indicate that the GCI renewal can best be advanced in the Caribbean by giving emphasis to Trinitarian theology, to the cultivation of healthy identity among pastors and members, and to the development of a capacity to provide mission-focused leadership to both formal organizations and informal movements. These three findings were then employed to help target, shape and provide content for the equipping process. This study concludes with some remarks and recommendations that focus on how the church is a social movement of people serving God’s Kingdom in the present age. More specifically, these recommendations also include how renewal requires attention to both the sociological complexities of people and the theological-spiritual realities of responding to Kingdom initiatives. Specific recommendations focused on personal, corporate, structural, missional and conceptual dimensions of renewal.",913385038,,Dissertations & Theses," Fleming, Charles B.FlemingB.CharlesFleming, Charles B.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2551915081 , 66551381 , 66569 , 9781267072283 , 3487696 , 3487696", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267072283, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/913385038?accountid=14496," 0319 Clerical studies , 0320 Religious history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0454 Management , 0469 Theology"," 0319 Clerical studies , 0320 Religious history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0454 Management , 0469 Theology"," 0319 Clerical studies , 0320 Religious history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0454 Management , 0469 Theology",," 0319 Clerical studies , 0320 Religious history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0454 Management , 0469 Theology"," Clerical studies , Religious history , Caribbean Studies , Management , Theology , Religious congregations , God , Qualitative research"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Caribbean , Grace Communion International , Leadership , Missional , Renewal , Spirituality , Transformation , Worldwide Church of God",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Renewal+and+transformation+in+Grace+Communion+International+%28formerly+Worldwide+Church+of+God%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fleming%2C+Charles+B.&amp;isbn=9781267072283&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"“Effective evangelism” in the city: Donald McGavran's missiology and urban contexts,"This dissertation examines the missiology of Donald A. McGavran as it applies in urban contexts. Chapter 1 introduces the research question by examining the current state of global urbanization and urban missions. Alongside the study of urban missions is an outline of the rise of Donald McGavran's church growth thought through the twentieth century, including the rise and decline of the Church Growth Movement's missiological emphasis. Chapter 2 includes a more in-depth biographical study of Donald Anderson McGavran and an outline of his church growth missiology. The biographical section surveys McGavran's missionary career and the development of church growth thought. The chapter concludes with an outline of key principles of church growth missiology. Chapter 3 presents an overview of McGavran's understanding of urban missions, including a survey of his writing and teaching directed specifically at urban missions. Because much of McGavran's influence on cities came through his students at the Institute of Church Growth and the School of World Mission at Fuller Theological Seminary, the chapter includes a brief outline of his students' work. The final three chapters go more deeply into three key elements of McGavran's urban missiology that have application to contemporary urban ministry. Chapter 4 addresses McGavran's contention that research is a key to church growth, with an emphasis on his advocacy of urban research. Chapter 5 explains McGavran's understanding of evangelism in urban contexts. Within this understanding, three important facets of evangelistic strategy are addressed: people movements, the Homogeneous Unit Principle, and church planting. Chapter 6 delves into McGavran's work related to ""holistic"" missions and his understanding of the relationship between social ministry and missions. McGavran's leadership in the conciliar/evangelical debates is addressed, as is his own work related to social justice issues. Chapter 7 answers the final research question, how might McGavran's teachings be applied in urban contexts today, if at all? The dissertation concludes with a summary and reinforcing insights from McGavran's teaching on urban missions.",914205159,,Dissertations & Theses," Walters, Jeffrey Kirk, Sr.WaltersKirkJeffreySr.Walters, Jeffrey Kirk, Sr.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2553590041 , 60972021 , 66569 , 9781267077615 , 3488002 , 3488002", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267077615, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/914205159?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0469 Theology"," 0320 Religious history , 0469 Theology"," 0320 Religious history , 0469 Theology",," 0320 Religious history , 0469 Theology"," Religious history , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Church growth , Evangelism , McGavran, Donald A. , Missions , Urban , Urban missions",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%9CEffective+evangelism%E2%80%9D+in+the+city%3A+Donald+McGavran%27s%0Amissiology+and+urban+contexts&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Walters%2C+Jeffrey+Kirk%2C+Sr.&amp;isbn=9781267077615&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Political legitimacy, citizens' mobilization, and leaders' survival","Leader survival has been addressed mainly by international relations students, while regime survival and government survival have been dealt with mainly by comparativists. Most studies that examine leaders' survival neglect how their constituents (both voters and nonvoters) view the leaders' competence, parties' representation and accountability of political systems, and how the electorates' behaviors, both conventional and unconventional, instigate political instability that may substantially increase the risk of deposition. I adopt a theoretical structure of the selectorate theory proposed by Bueno de Mesquita et al. (2003), but adapt it as well by focusing on the role of the masses. By using individual-level data sets such as the World Values Survey, Afro-Barometer, and Asian-Barometer (Chapter 3), and the Korea Social Science Data (Chapter 4), the effect of electoral politics on political trust and a leader's survival is examined; and the leaders' data of Archigos and other country-level data (Chapter 5) allow me to examine leaders' survival. Chapter 2 reviews literature about the potential causes of leaders' survival by focusing on elections, perceived legitimacy, and political movements. First, political legitimacy is viewed as both a consequence of voters' perception of the selectorate institutions and as a cause for leaders to secure the support of citizens. Finally, leaders' survival is understood in the context of mass political movement and voters' electoral behavior. Chapter 3 argues that the loyalty norm for each leader provides an institutional context for voters to perceive how legitimate their system is. For the mass public, a multilevel analysis shows that the institutional legacy of the loyalty norm matters for electoral winners and nonpartisans as much as the short-term loyalty norm for electoral losers. This is because the mass public's attitudes rely on their memory of how often leadership turnover has occurred in the polity while the leader's behavior is more based upon the short-term loyalty norm. In Chapter 4, South Korea's impeachment experience illustrates how electoral politics and partisan status affect the citizen's perception of a president's impeachment at the individual level. Admitting a limitation of the validity of variables measured at the aggregate level, especially for the loyalty norm measure, I take advantage of the unique experiment-like impeachment process in South Korea in 2004. South Korea's recent experience of the impeachment provides differing responses by partisans and non-partisans. Loyalty to the Uri Party and partisan status influence voters' impeachment support. As partisans are more likely to have any preferences for the issue of impeachment, they are labeled ranging from “loyal”, to “dissenting”, to “defecting”. In contrast to partisans' wide range of impeachment support, non-partisans' moderate level change of the impeachment support illustrates two types of non-partisans: sympathetic and ideological non-partisan. This means that ideology matters when a fledgling incumbent party tries to hold non-partisans' interests in the conservative party system. Chapter 5 supposes that stability in leader survival is the key interest to a leader herself although it may not provide an accountable leader. The hypothesis to test in this chapter is whether leader longevity is influenced by mass movement that is indicated as electoral behavior, or depends on a leader's strategy of survival determined by the loyalty norm institution. Based on a composite data set that provides information on electoral politics and the winning coalition institution, I employ three measures of electoral and social stability—the level of mass threats, electoral non-participation, and electoral competition—to test these hypotheses. The empirical findings indicate that electoral non-participation and mass threats are key determinants to the risk of leader deposition, while the leader herself has room to manipulate the risk by constraining the level of mass media.",914373126,,Dissertations & Theses," Jung, ChangkukJungChangkukJung, Changkuk",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2554546071 , 60448691 , 66569 , 9781267084958 , 3488485 , 3488485", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267084958, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/914373126?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science," Political science , Citizen participation , Leadership , International relations , Government , Political systems"," Social sciences , Electoral losers , Mass threat , Nonvoters , Political legitimacy , Political survival , Political trust , Public attitudes , Selectorate theory",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Political+legitimacy%2C+citizens%27+mobilization%2C+and+leaders%27+survival&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jung%2C+Changkuk&amp;isbn=9781267084958&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Talking Trash: Oral Histories of Food In/Security from the Margins of a Dumpster,"This dissertation explores oral histories with dumpster divers of varying food security levels. The project draws from 15 oral history interviews selected from an 18-interview collection conducted between Spring 2008 and Summer 2010. Interviewees self-identified as divers; varied in economic, gender, sexual, and ethnic identity; and ranged in age from 18-64 years. To supplement this modest number of interviews, I also conducted 52 surveys in Summer 2010. I interview divers as theorists in their own right, and engage the specific ways in which the divers identify and construct their food choice actions in terms of individual food security and broader ecological implications of trash both as a food source and as an international residue of production, trade, consumption, and waste policy. This research raises inquiries into the gender, racial, and class dynamics of food policy, informal food economies, common pool resource usage, and embodied histories of public health and sanitation. Topically, the chapters build from Chapter 1 : ""Dumpstering the American Way of Life""--a theoretical analysis of the space of the dumpster and its social and legally stigmatized margins framed within questions of ideal citizenship and consumption. Chapter 2 : ""Situating Food in the Dumpster"" explores the possibilities of (re)imagining the dumpster-as-food-source within contexts of food in/security. Chapter 3 : ""On Twinkies, Chickpeas, and the 'Real' Food Paradigm"" is an examination of the contemporary re-visitation and application of modernist food discourses as a means of constructing alternative food paradigms in the present. I trace a particularly gendered modernist history through to contemporary food movement literature constructing 'good' food and 'real' food including works by chef-activists and scholars such as Alice Waters, Michael Pollan, Carlo Petrini, Jamie Oliver, and Marion Nestle. Chapter 4 : ""Tackling Informality: The Dumpster as Public Health Threat"" engages turn-of-the-century food specific public health measures in relation to a 'politics of clean' as it applies to the dumpster and extends to mechanisms of State control over other exemplary informal street food economies. By overlapping the oral narratives with research about food and waste policies, practices, and literature, I build an overall hypothesis. I begin by arguing that the interviews show there are broad spectrums of divers and diving narratives.

Animating large-scale crowds has emerged in recent years as a challenging problem in film, game, virtual training, and education applications. Traditional crowd simulation approaches typically focus on navigational path-finding and local collision avoidance problems using steering rules and social forces, which are able to successfully synthesize the local movement trajectory of each crowd agent. However, relatively few existing efforts explore how to optimally control individual agents' detailed motions and global strategic formations throughout a crowd. Therefore, the main goal of this dissertation is to propose an agent-based framework for embedding realistic motion variations and group formation behaviors into crowd simulations. In the low-level simulations, the key idea of adding variation of agent motions is to dynamically control motion styles of agents through maximizing the style variety of local neighbors and universal style utilization while keeping the style consistency for each agent as natural as possible. Our scheme can serve as a complementary layer for most high-level crowd models to increase the realism of a simulated crowd. When we apply the animation control scheme above, the perception of motion transitions in a pedestrian crowd is affected by many collective features such as crowd density, appearance variations, motion variations, and sub-group interaction patterns. We conducted a series of psychophysical experiments to investigate how these crowd features can influence human perception on walking motion transitions in a crowd when inexpensive motion blending algorithms are used. In the high-level crowd behavior simulations, collective group formations are often manually specified via various hard constraints such as pre-defined key-frames of the exact agent distribution. Instead, the global configurations of different group formations in our framework are parameterized from arbitrary user sketches, which are interactively specified during the simulations. In other words, we propose an intuitive yet efficient approach to generate group formations by sketching formation boundaries. Our approach can automatically compute the desired positions for each agent in the target formation and generate the agent correspondences between key-frames.",916596704,,Dissertations & Theses," Gu, QinGuQinGu, Qin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2563677221 , 64186901 , 66569 , 9781267110299 , 3492380 , 3492380", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267110299, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/916596704?accountid=14496, 0984 Computer science, 0984 Computer science, 0984 Computer science,, 0984 Computer science, Computer science," Applied sciences , Animation , Crowd simulation , Graphics , Motion variations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Agent-based+approaches+for+stylizing+motion+variations+and+formations+in+crowd+simulation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gu%2C+Qin&amp;isbn=9781267110299&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Hezbollah model,"On September 6, 2006 a ceasefire was recognized by the United Nations ending a fierce battle between the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) and Hezbollah. For the first time, the Israelis met a force that stopped their advances and challenged conventional wisdom that the IDF was the region's superior military force. From inauspicious beginnings as a Shiite resistance group fighting for survival in the Lebanese Civil War, Hezbollah has evolved into a potent political and military force in the Middle East. Its ascension has been met with alarm in the West and their model has been studied closely by other organizations globally. This thesis explores Hezbollah's organizational model from its inception, following its evolution into a power broker in Middle East politics. Before being able to explore its organizational model, it is critical to understand its past. When observing its evolution, one must understand the Shiite tradition, and the profound effect that it had on the formation of Hezbollah's ideology. As one begins to understand its history, examining their organizational framework will begin to make sense. The second section examines how Hezbollah established and developed its robust social services infrastructure. In order to better serve their constituents and resist against their enemies, Hezbollah members recognized the significance in developing a system to take care of their own. This integrated social service apparatus filled a vacuum left by the Lebanese government and has earned them the trust and loyalty of their citizens. The third section examines how Hezbollah shapes its narrative in order to highlight its strengths and minimize its weaknesses on an international stage. Its television station, al-Manar, has afforded the group with a platform from which it can project an image that accentuates the members' good qualities while opposing any defects. In addition, the station provides them with a forum to address their constituents and encourage resistance against the Israelis and the West. The fourth section shows how Muqtada al-Sadr and his organization have loosely followed the Hezbollah model to make steady gains in Iraq. While there is not an exact correlation between the two movements, the similarities are striking; Muqtada al-Sadr has employed many Hezbollah tactics with great success. Finally, this thesis looks at how to deal with Hezbollah and organizations like it that have adopted their model. Anticipating how this model may adapt and develop over time will be essential in dealing with this issue. Whether or not Hezbollah will be an actor that America can deal with remains to be seen, but addressing the systemic issues that drive people toward Hezbollah will be critical in the future.",916911718,,Dissertations & Theses," Elder, Christopher L.ElderL.ChristopherElder, Christopher L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2565510161 , 56190551 , 66569 , 9781267077257 , 1503158 , 1503158", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267077257, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/916911718?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations, Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Hezbollah+model&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Elder%2C+Christopher+L.&amp;isbn=9781267077257&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Portable Borders/Mythical Sites: Performance Art and Politics on the US &lt;i&gt;Frontera&lt;/i&gt;, 1968–Present","Artists working on the U.S. side of the U.S.-Mexican border have, since the 1970s Chicano movement, actively explored this charged site in generating socially conscious art projects. This border art, formerly seen as ""marginal,"" is explored in this dissertation as central to an interrogation of site-specificity and globalization – particularly in the medium of performance art. Based on an analysis of artworks from four decades by artists such as David Avalos and the Border Art Workshop/Taller de Arte Fronterizo, Guillermo Gómez-Peña, Coco Fusco, Felipe Ehrenberg, and the collaborative team of Allora and Calzadilla, the dissertation claims that border artists both anticipated and responded to larger economic and social shifts, particularly the trade relations heralded by NAFTA in 1994. Site-specificity and performance became complex and sometimes contradictory tools that these artists used to make statements on the nature of economic and political relations between North and South, rich and poor, American and Mexican, citizen and immigrant. Art, rather than pure political action, is particularly equipped to encourage such exploration, as the indeterminacy of art (rather than the determinacy of political action) allows for the processes of social change. This line of inquiry can be extended to other border and transnational regions. Rethinking art and art history from its ""borders"" – literal and metaphorical – ultimately destabilizes traditional art historiographic narratives in a productive way.

I trace the development of the genre in China from its early history through the New Culture Movement, exploring the relationship between science fiction and other modes of writing that were promoted in the quest for national salvation. Sources include historical accounts of the introduction and institutionalization of science in China, pictorial representations of real and imagined scientific and technological innovations, writing on the role of science in the quest for national renewal and a number of novels and short stories. In Chapter 1, I draw on recent theoretical work that understands science fiction as a product of Orientalist discourse, demonstrating that the advent of mass production and mass consumption fostered a readership for science fiction while the fantasy of colonial spoils helped create its imaginary horizon. I also argue that the genre is best understood in the context of Tani Barlow's ""colonial modernity,"" approaching the changes of early 20 th century China in terms of the transnational traffic of ideas, cultural trends, and material culture spawned by European colonial expansion. I elucidate the relationship between local understandings of science and global exchanges, acknowledging the pervasive influence of colonialism upon these exchanges. In Chapters 2 and 3, I examine the complex web of associations that accompanied the introduction of new concepts and terminologies to late imperial China. I also examine the responses to science that the late Qing engendered through close readings of the popular science writings and illustrations pertaining to science and technology in the Dianshizhai Huabao pictorial. Through readings of writing on science and science fiction by seminal late Qing and Republican period intellectuals such as Lu Xun (1881–1936), Kang Youwei (1858–1927), and Liang Qichao (1873–1929), I demonstrate that the introduction of Western science to China was marked by deep anxiety about the relationship between science and empire, and the implications of social Darwinism. One of the greatest crises visible in the fiction and popular science writing of late Qing and early Republican intellectuals is the ambivalence related to the co-opting of genres complicit with imperialism in order to overthrow the fields of knowledge that they produce. In Chapter 4, I present a close reading of Wu Jianren's (1866–1910) New Story of the Stone (1905), arguing that the novel aggregates nearly all of the key metaphors of late Qing science fiction. Building upon this mode of reading, Chapter 5 examines a number of original works of late Qing science fiction, including Huangjiang Diaosou's (b.?) Tales of the Moon Colony (1902), Xu Nianci's (1874–1908) ""New Tales of Mr. Braggadocio"" (1904), Bihe Guanzhuren's (1871–1919) The New Era (1908), and others, arguing that Chinese authors were vexed by the difficulties of turning the rhetorical knives of colonial discourse against their colonial wielders. Chapter 6 follows my analysis of late Qing science fiction is followed by an examination of the changing role of SF through the May fourth period, reading Lao She's (1899–1966) City of Cats (1932), in light of the 1920s reassessment of Chinese tradition and Western science.",920012519,,Dissertations & Theses," Isaacson, Nathaniel KennethIsaacsonKennethNathanielIsaacson, Nathaniel Kenneth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2579401411 , 66061531 , 66569 , 9781267144126 , 3493491 , 3493491", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267144126, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/920012519?accountid=14496, 0305 Asian literature, 0305 Asian literature, 0305 Asian literature,, 0305 Asian literature, Asian literature," Language, literature and linguistics , China , Colonialism , Modernity , Science fiction",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Colonial+Modernities+and+Chinese+Science+Fiction&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Isaacson%2C+Nathaniel+Kenneth&amp;isbn=9781267144126&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Girls' education as a means or end of development? A case study of gender and education policy knowledge and action in The Gambia,"Girls' education has been promoted by the international development community for over two decades; however, it has proven harder to promote gender equality through education than it has been to promote gender parity in education. Of significance is the global circulation and coexistence of two competing rationales for the importance of girls' education: economic efficiency and social justice. The cost of ignoring how and why Southern governments and their development partners choose to promote girls' education is high: an over-emphasis on economic efficiency can mean that the root causes of gendered inequalities in society remain unchallenged, and more social justice-oriented reforms become marginalized. This thesis uses a critical feminist lens to qualitatively investigate the role and significance of human capital, human rights, and human capabilities policy models in the context of the production and enactment of gender equality in education policy knowledge in The Gambia, a small, aid-dependent Muslim nation in West Africa. The purpose of the study was to assess the scope education policies provide for positive change in the lives of Gambian women and girls. Towards illuminating relations of power in and the politics of gender equality in education policy processes, the study compares and contrasts written texts with the perspectives of state and non-state policy actors. The study is based on data drawn from interviews, participant observation, and documentary analysis. The findings suggest that different gender equality in education ideas and practices have been selectively mobilized and incorporated into education policy processes in The Gambia. At the level of policy talk, girls' education is framed as important for both national economic growth, and “women's empowerment”. However, the policy solutions designed and implemented, with the support of donors, have tended to work with rather than against the status quo. Power and politics was evident in divergent interpretations and struggles to fix the meaning of key concepts such as gender, gender equality, gender equity, and empowerment. Religious beliefs, anti-feminist politics, and the national feminist movement were identified as important forces shaping gender equality in education knowledge and action in the country.",920161849,,Dissertations & Theses," Manion, CarolineManionCarolineManion, Caroline",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2580315511 , 67164342 , 66569 , 9780494778753 , NR77875 , NR77875", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9780494778753, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/920161849?accountid=14496," 0458 Education Policy , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," 0458 Education Policy , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," 0458 Education Policy , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies",," 0458 Education Policy , 0639 Sub Saharan Africa Studies"," Education Policy , Sub Saharan Africa Studies , Girls , Case studies , Knowledge , Gambia"," Education , Social sciences , Development , Feminism , Gambia , Gender equality , Girls , Girls' education , Human capabilities , Policy borrowing , Policy transfer , Public policy , Social justice , Transformative education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Girls%27+education+as+a+means+or+end+of+development%3F+A+case+study+of+gender+and+education+policy+knowledge+and+action+in+The+Gambia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Manion%2C+Caroline&amp;isbn=9780494778753&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Persuasive citizens, unconvinced radicals: Comparing workers' politics in two towns in central India","In this dissertation, I do a comparative and historical ethnography of workers’ movements in two adjacent towns in central India. I invite attention to the shift in workers’ politics due to the retreat of the nationalist welfare state in the context of neo-liberal reforms. In the first town of Dalli-Rajhara, manually employed mine workers in state owned iron-ore mines persuaded the state employer to grant them labor rights. Their insurgent movement began in 1977, when the Indian state was aggressively pursuing economic nationalism. The workers could coerce the state to be accountable: All manual workers were eventually absorbed as regular mineworkers. In the second town of Bhilai, inspired by the first movement, casually employed workers in privately owned industries contended with their employers for labor rights. This movement began in 1990, which was the end of the era of economic nationalism and beginning of the neoliberal regime. The workers were losing to neoliberalizing state and capital, and their activism was fragmented. I argue that the basic shift due to neo-liberal reforms in India is not in the protective role of the state, but in citizen’s ability to hold the state accountable by challenging its legitimacy. This research is based on seventeen months of ethnographic and archival research in India conducted in 2003, 2004 and 2006. Most of the evidence is in the form of participant accounts of forty-five workers in the two movements. I also interviewed, and had numerous casual conversations with onlookers, regular workers, other union leaders, personnel managers, villagers, mine officials, contractors and many Delhi-based activists and academicians. I examined rare documents on contemporary Indian history from academic institutions, private collections, as well as state departments. My research intervenes in existing literature in two important ways. Much of the discussion on labor activism in the neoliberal period has focused on those working for capital centered in the United States. I show that neo-liberal capital is de-centered with receiving states as well as indigenous capital having very high stakes in the process. This complicates labor activism since labor and the new indigenous-global capital are still embedded in the old political culture of economic nationalism. In central India, this meant that workers were reluctant to let go of old protest tactics, while capitalists could mobilize public voice against the workers on the grounds of sabotaging national production. The focus of literature by Indian scholars in the neoliberal period has been on loss of employment of formal employees of the state. I draw attention to loss of work and resistance of informally employed rural migrants, the enormous mass of which are unlikely to be absorbed by the expanding sectors of the global economy. I suggest that given the fragmentation of conventional labor activism, this workforce could potentially mobilize as a huge social force demanding radical reforms.",921339106,,Dissertations & Theses," Nair, Manjusha SasidharanNairSasidharanManjushaNair, Manjusha Sasidharan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2585605831 , 67373332 , 66569 , 9781267172280 , 3494810 , 3494810", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267172280, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/921339106?accountid=14496," 0629 Labor relations , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0629 Labor relations , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0629 Labor relations , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0629 Labor relations , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Labor relations , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Globalization , India , Labor movements , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Persuasive+citizens%2C+unconvinced+radicals%3A+Comparing+workers%27+politics+in+two+towns+in+central+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nair%2C+Manjusha+Sasidharan&amp;isbn=9781267172280&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Ghost workers: Contemporary French documentary filmmaking in the global age,"In recent years, French documentary filmmakers have recorded the impact globalization has had on their society; the corpus presented here gives evidence of a shared effort to question the political and ideological affiliations of a practice largely committed to leftist ideals throughout most of the twentieth century. This dissertation examines the convergence of anti- or alterglobalization sentiments and the documentary turn to ethics in the last twenty years in an effort to reinvent social and political documentary filmmaking as an ethical praxis committed to the reconciliation of individual emancipation and collective responsibility. The demise of workers’ movements and trade unions in the last decades has led filmmakers to explore other modes of subversion of neo-liberal global capitalism, the principal target of contemporary social documentary. These filmmakers have striven to undermine the historical and philosophical legitimacy of the equation of “work” and waged employment. The unemployed, the gleaner, the consumer, and the farmer have been foregrounded as new models of subjective emancipation for the proponents of an altermondialisation . Filmmakers themselves have invested their own bodies in the denunciation of the global expansion of neo-liberalism. This study draws from Michel Foucault’s and Jean-Luc Nancy’s conceptions of ethics and subjectivity in order to account for Luc Moullet’s, Vincent Glenn’s, Agnès Varda’s, Raymond Depardon’s and Jonathan Nossiter’s “embodied knowledge” (as defined by Bill Nichols). First, the dissertation argues that globalization has encouraged filmmakers to expand the doctrinal politics of early militant cinemas into a broader ethical project which consists of probing into the philosophical, social and environmental foundations of a sustainable world democracy. Second, by defining its “politics of location”—another term used by Nichols—through historically polyvalent concepts, such as artisanal savoir-faire, terroir and work, this corpus reinvigorates long-standing national debates and casts new light on old cultural assumptions, especially France’s endless historical opposition between urban modernity and rural conservatism. Finally, contemporary filmmakers shift French cinema’s auteurist claims from elitist inclinations towards a post-national reflection on documentary practice’s unique ability to promote an ethical consciousness and engagement with the world at large.",921357871,,Dissertations & Theses," Evrard, AudreyEvrardAudreyEvrard, Audrey",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2585811341 , 65294301 , 66569 , 9781267155214 , 3496296 , 3496296", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267155214, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/921357871?accountid=14496, 0900 Film studies, 0900 Film studies, 0900 Film studies,, 0900 Film studies, Film studies," Communication and the arts , Depardon, Raymond , Documentary film , Ethics , France , Glenn, Vincent , Globalization , Labor , Moullet, Luc , Nossiter, Jonathan , Politics , Varda, Agnes",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ghost+workers%3A+Contemporary+French+documentary+filmmaking+in+the+global+age&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Evrard%2C+Audrey&amp;isbn=9781267155214&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The People's Republic of Letters: Towards a Media History of Twentieth-Century Socialist Internationalism,"The People's Republic of Letters sketches a media history of socialist internationalism. Such a history is bound to be partial because of the multiplicity of media—print, music, theater, film, and others—that sustained a worldwide socialist culture in the twentieth century. While devoting most of its attention to the engage novel, which occupied a central place in leftist cultural thought for much of that century, this dissertation also examines two other media forms that have superseded it as the main source of publics co-terminous with the worldwide left: singer-songwriter performance of the 1960s (or guitar poetry, as I shall call it) and political documentary film today. Not unlike the nineteenth-century novel and newspaper in Benedict Anderson's famous account, all three served as technologies of the imagined community of the international left. They not only helped sustain its unity and resolve its multiple contradictions but also gave it its distinctive affective horizons and cemented the historical bloc between the left's main constituents: the intellectuals and the working classes. These cultural forms fulfilled these functions in one of two ways: (1) by the act of circulating and providing common texts to leftists from different parts of the world or (2) by inscribing leftist communities into their narratives and imagining the solidarities that bound them. This dissertation applies both of these approaches to each of the media under consideration. The concept of a (counter-)public helps us mediate between the two. Taking as its starting point the literary interactions of interwar readers and writers living in state socialism with their leftist counterparts outside, Part I of this dissertation questions the framework of Soviet manipulation of foreign sympathizers, which has characterized much of the earlier scholarship on those interactions, and goes on to conceptualize them as constitutive of a proper international literary field, with agents, institutions, borders, and principles of operation. That field I shall call the People's Republic of Letters. The Old-Left novel, with its apostolic narratives of conversion, persecution, martyrdom, and community, provided its lifeblood. As the case of the mid-twentieth-century American proletarian novelist Howard Fast suggests, the Soviet state was both the condition of possibility for the People's Republic and the reason for its demise. In-between, it could never quite control the Republic. While Western leftist writers and readers like Fast were withdrawing from the People's Republic, it was attracting new ones from the emerging Third World. Part II of this dissertation reconstructs this attempt of a common Soviet-Afro-Asian literary front between the late 1950s and the late 1970s and examines the alignment of separate national struggles into a broader international project inscribed into many Third-World novels. As a whole, however, in the second half of the twentieth century, the novel was losing its capacity to construct political publics. Guitar poetry assumed that role with respect to the 1960s social movements in Eastern and Western Europe, North and South America. Part III of this dissertation is devoted to the spontaneous, non-hierarchical, and carnivalesque character of its homologous national publics, which, like the movements they expressed, rarely succeeded in linking up internationally. This dissertation will end with a reflection on the contemporary political documentary film as the main medium common to contemporary leftists worldwide.",921657882,,Dissertations & Theses," Djagalov, RossenDjagalovRossenDjagalov, Rossen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2587877231 , 63648451 , 66569 , 9781267166760 , 3496810 , 3496810", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267166760, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/921657882?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0413 Music , 0900 Film studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0413 Music , 0900 Film studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0413 Music , 0900 Film studies",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0413 Music , 0900 Film studies"," Comparative literature , Modern literature , Music , Film studies"," Communication and the arts , Language, literature and linguistics , Documentary film , Internationalism , Media , Populism , Public , Singer-songwriter , Socialism , World literature",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+People%27s+Republic+of+Letters%3A+Towards+a+Media+History+of+Twentieth-Century+Socialist+Internationalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Djagalov%2C+Rossen&amp;isbn=9781267166760&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Creating Spaces for Dialogue: Participatory Action Research in Free Humanities Programs in Canada,"Using a Participatory Action Research (PAR) methodology, directors of Free Humanities programs collaborated to research, act and reflect on the challenges and rewards of Clemente-inspired programs in Canada, which acknowledged a rupture from Earl Shorris’ Clemente Course in the Humanities but had yet to fully expound their similarities and differences. Identifying common critical issues they experience – from finding sustained funding to responding to academic and other pressing student needs, directors shared approximately one year of dialogue and reflections and presented collectively in a workshop panel at St. Thomas University’s International Liberal Arts Conference in Fredericton, New Brunswick, September 30 – October 2, 2010. While the programs acknowledge and to some degree lessen the economic and social barriers of their students, the programs themselves contend with many of these same barriers in the struggle to sustain free humanities courses. As the directors continue to collaborate, we identify the core ethical concerns from within. This is a community researching itself and participating in an educational social movement. Creating Spaces for Dialogue is a participatory action research study into how and why we do what we do. It is an opportunity for learning collaboratively, reflecting on the links between theory and practice, and then communicating what we learn about the pedagogical and philosophical underpinnings of the Canadian programs. As educators, the spirituality of our practice comes through not only in what we teach but the way that we teach; it enters into the ‘why’ and the ‘how’ in the process of what we do. As conscientious educators, we have to be aware of our praxis and reflect on how our practice informs theory and vice versa because what we believe about people is manifested in and through our relationships, our dialogue. Intuitively and analytically, each program has been developing its own approaches to engaging participants in dialogue. This dissertation focuses on analysing an intuitive ethic of care that directors of Canadian Free Humanities programs have been infusing into their work. Findings include ways that directors of these programs are well positioned to extend their collaborative research from discourse to social action.

It focuses on how members of five conservative Protestant groups—the fundamentalist movement, the Lutheran Church—Missouri Synod, the Southern Baptist Convention, the Assemblies of God, and the neo-evangelical movement—responded to sweeping changes in American family life and social thought during the middle decades of the twentieth century. Confronted with changes in women's roles, rising divorce rates, changing romantic and sexual expectations within marriage, social chaos in the form of crime and international threats, and secularization, they replied with a growing pool of advice books, periodical literature, sermons, and denominational and parachurch campaigns that aimed to define and revive Christian marriage and parenthood. Conservative Protestant writing about the family reveals that commentators sought to make the religious ideals of personal salvation and holiness cohere with middle-class American faith in progress and self-improvement. During the interwar years writers articulated a conservative religious version of the middle-class ideal of the family as an emotionally intimate and spiritually potent institution able to build the nation by forming the minds, characters, and bodies of individual citizens. Following World War II, they increasingly presented Christian belief and practice as a means of achieving a companionable marriage, sought to ensure harmonious and sexually warm relationships between couples, and instructed parents to balance the rigors of Christian training and discipline with an appreciation for the child's feelings and developmental needs. Greater acceptance of popular and counseling psychology encouraged conservative Protestants to embrace the expectation that personal and marital happiness could be obtained through self-understanding, self-improvement, and a salvific relationship with God. In the 1970s Dr. James Dobson and Tim and Beverley LaHaye, all leaders in the emerging New Christian Right, established themselves as psychologists, counselors, and teachers invested in improving family life. In these roles, they called upon conservative Protestants to defend their conception of the family and moral order, along with the cherished hopes they had attached to each.",926435900,,Dissertations & Theses," Gottwig, Danielle DuBoisGottwigDuBoisDanielleGottwig, Danielle DuBois",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2603143721 , 67444152 , 66569 , 9781267161178 , 3496532 , 3496532", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267161178, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/926435900?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," Religious history , American history , Womens studies , Conservatism , Protestantism , Families & family life"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Conservative Protestant , Evangelicalism , Marriage , New Christian Right , Psychology , Religious right",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Before+the+culture+wars%3A+Conservative+Protestants+and+the+family%2C+1920%E2%80%931980&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gottwig%2C+Danielle+DuBois&amp;isbn=9781267161178&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Effects of Market Approaches to Green Technologies for the Poor: The Case of Improved Cookstoves,"""Sustainable"" or ""green"" technologies for the global poor have been proposed as solutions to the difficult problem of how to improve the lives of the world's poorest without contributing to climate change or other environmental catastrophes. While such technologies were once the domain of non-profit and government funded initiatives, they are now increasingly developed and deployed through market mechanisms. Using improved biomass cookstoves as a representative technology, this dissertation seeks to assess the social and technological effects of this shift to market-based approaches for development and dissemination of sustainable technologies for the poor. Chapter 2 uses a Science and Technology Studies theoretical framework to follow the coproduction of the material form of improved biomass cookstoves and the cookstove movement from the 1960s to the present. The chapter shows that during the 1980s, particular conceptions and articulations of the problem that cookstoves were meant to solve led to a definition of technological ""improvement"" that included fuel efficiency, consistency of performance, and ability to scale quickly. This particular type of cookstove was much more compatible with mass-production than traditional artisanal production, creating social organizations that could mass-produce cookstoves, which then encouraged commercial approaches in order to recover costs. The move to a market-based approach was in part driven by and in part the cause of a particular kind of technology, demonstrating the mutual coproduction of the social and technological. Chapter 3 takes one market-based tool, intellectual property, and analyses the effect of deploying it in the realm of green technologies for the poor. Using the contrasting cases of UV Waterworks and the Berkeley-Darfur Stove the chapter identifies some of the salient social and technical characteristics that determine whether such effect is positive. The complex social arrangements involved in developing technologies for the poor mean that tools such as intellectual property can be useful but must be compatible with the organizations involved at the level at which the tool is targeted, each of which may have different orientations and incentives. The type of funding at each level, donor versus investor, appears to be a particularly important variable in predicting positive or negative outcomes. Chapter 4 examines one specific environmental policy market mechanism, the carbon market, and its role in stimulating technological change, invention, innovation, and dissemination (Schumpeter, 1942) in biomass cookstoves. It shows that carbon credits are thus far improving diffusion of current cookstoves but failing to stimulate innovation in cookstoves with stronger health and environmental impacts. Additionally, the chapter shows that the carbon market is influencing the selection of cookstoves for dissemination. The characteristics selected for are most compatible with centralized, mass production, which is likely to strengthen the shift towards these approaches.",928456920,,Dissertations & Theses," Booker, Kayje MerreaBookerMerreaKayjeBooker, Kayje Merrea",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2611325441 , 64451241 , 66569 , 9781267225825 , 3498771 , 3498771", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267225825, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/928456920?accountid=14496," 0474 Environmental management , 0640 Sustainability"," 0474 Environmental management , 0640 Sustainability"," 0474 Environmental management , 0640 Sustainability",," 0474 Environmental management , 0640 Sustainability"," Environmental management , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Biomass cookstoves , Carbon markets , Intellectual property , Technology innovations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Effects+of+Market+Approaches+to+Green+Technologies+for+the+Poor%3A+The+Case+of+Improved+Cookstoves&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Booker%2C+Kayje+Merrea&amp;isbn=9781267225825&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Cultivation, Capital, and Contamination: Urban Agriculture in Oakland, California","Urban agriculture has enjoyed renewed popularity across North America over the past few years due to a vibrant food justice movement challenging disparities in access to healthy food, as well as to municipal policy and planning efforts focusing on urban sustainability and public health. Using qualitative and quantitative methods, this dissertation links critical political economic analysis and practical, action-oriented research grounded in community engagement to uncover the historical and geographic conditions necessary for the rise of a vibrant urban agriculture movement in Oakland California. In addition to being critical and reflective, this dissertation is also prescriptive in its examination of urban agriculture's potential to scale up in way that contributes significantly to food justice and urban sustainability. These two tasks mark the division of the dissertation into two equal parts comprised of three chapters each. Broadly, Part 1 (Origins) examines the historical and contemporary conditions, both necessary and contingent, that have given rise to the current urban agriculture movement in Oakland. In Chapter 1 I use the theoretical framework of metabolic rift (which I disaggregate into three interrelated forms: ecological, social, and individual) to explore the multiple origins of urban agriculture as a global phenomenon and demonstrate how it arises in response to the upheavals and alienation inherent to a capitalist political economy. In Chapter 2, I argue that understanding urban agriculture in Oakland today requires examining the city's uneven development. Through a historical overview of Oakland's economic geography from the early 20 th century to the dawn of the Neoliberal era, I explain how the ""demarcated devaluation"" of industrial and commercial capital concentrated poverty in the city's flatlands and diminished food access for low-income people of color. In Chapter 3 I explain how the contemporary urban agriculture movement arose in response to this devaluation. Through a relational history linking seminal moments of flatlands activism (the Black Panther Party's Free Breakfast Program, the environmental justice movement, and a social justice-oriented urban greening movement) to the contemporary food justice movement, I reveal how a multi-racial, cross-class alliance was formed around urban agriculture which was able to contest the material implications of flatlands devaluation in new political arenas, marshalling financial support. These scalar politics have led to urban agriculture's increased institutionalization and ongoing policy efforts to scale it up. Part 2 (Obstacles and Opportunities) addresses the environmental and policy obstacles that must be addressed before such scaling up of urban agriculture can take place. Drawing on participatory methods, the three chapters in this part address specific technical questions defined in collaboration with community members. In Chapter 4 I present a GIS-based inventory of potential urban agriculture sites and calculate their potential contribution to vegetable consumption in Oakland. Overall, the inventory identified more than 800 acres of publicly owned land that could potentially be used for food production. Devoting 500 acres to urban agriculture could contribute 19 to 48% of current vegetable consumption in Oakland (or 6 to 15% of recommended consumption) depending on production methods. In Chapter 5 I evaluate the extent to which soil lead (Pb) contamination may be an obstacle to the expansion of urban agriculture in Oakland. I use a combination of GIS and spatial statistics to characterize the spatial distribution of Pb on vacant land at multiple scales across Oakland and to identify relationships between soil Pb levels and anthropogenic factors such as zoning, housing stock, roads, airport, and land use, as well as biophysical factors such as soil series, soil chemical characteristics, and vegetative cover. I also assess the extent to which total soil Pb is actually available for plant uptake. Using samples collected in the field and two greenhouse experiments, I evaluate two chemical extractants (DTPA and MgCl 2 ) in an effort to identify the best proxy for plant available Pb and to relate plant availability to a suite of soil chemical characteristics. While soil Pb levels were significantly higher in West Oakland and residential areas than other parts of the city, levels were generally lower than federal screening levels of 400 parts per million. Old housing stock (and lead paint) proved to be the primary anthropogenic factor affecting soil Pb levels, while soil phosphorus proved to be the most important chemical factor. In Chapter 6 I focus on the policy obstacles to the scaling up of urban agriculture through a case study on the efforts of the Oakland Food Policy Council (OFPC) to develop new zoning definitions and operating standards for urban agriculture. Ultimately, pressure on City Council members by the OFPC, as well as public pressure following two high profile events (the passage of an urban agriculture ordinance in San Francisco and the citation of a prominent urban farmer for zoning violations), were necessary to motivate planning officials to update urban agriculture zoning in Oakland. I conclude with the observation that while the technical obstacles to urban agriculture's expansion may easily be overcome, political obstacles remain. Furthermore, urban agriculture alone cannot feed a city such as Oakland or mitigate unequal access to healthy food, but rather must be part of a coordinated push for regional equity that addresses all aspects of the food system, from production to processing, distribution, and retailing.",929198964,,Dissertations & Theses," McClintock, Nathan CraneMcClintockCraneNathanMcClintock, Nathan Crane",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2614388401 , 68093662 , 66569 , 9781267228697 , 3499021 , 3499021", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267228697, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/929198964?accountid=14496," 0359 Food Science , 0470 Environmental Health , 0473 Agriculture , 0501 Economics , 0640 Sustainability"," 0359 Food Science , 0470 Environmental Health , 0473 Agriculture , 0501 Economics , 0640 Sustainability"," 0359 Food Science , 0470 Environmental Health , 0473 Agriculture , 0501 Economics , 0640 Sustainability",," 0359 Food Science , 0470 Environmental Health , 0473 Agriculture , 0501 Economics , 0640 Sustainability"," Food Science , Environmental Health , Agriculture , Economics , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Cultivation , Food justice , Lead , Soil contamination , Urban agriculture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultivation%2C+Capital%2C+and+Contamination%3A+Urban+Agriculture+in+Oakland%2C+California&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McClintock%2C+Nathan+Crane&amp;isbn=9781267228697&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Secondary stakeholders as agents of influence: Three essays on political risk, reputation, and multinational performance","Organizational researchers have recently taken an interest in the ways in which social movements, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and other secondary stakeholders attempt to influence corporate behavior. Scholars, however, have yet to carefully probe the link between secondary stakeholder legal action and target firm stock market performance. This is puzzling given the sharp rise in NGO-initiated civil lawsuits against corporations in recent years for alleged overseas human rights abuses and environmental misconduct. Furthermore, few studies have considered how such lawsuits impact a target firm’s intangible assets, namely its image and reputation. Structured in the form of three essays, this dissertation examined the antecedents and consequences of secondary stakeholder legal activism in both conceptual and empirical settings. Essay One argued that conventional approaches to understanding political risk fail to account for the reputational risks to multinational enterprises (MNEs) posed by transnational networks of human rights NGOs employing litigation-based strategies. It offered a new framework for understanding this emerging challenge to multinational corporate activity. Essay Two empirically tested the relationship between the filing of human rights-related civil lawsuits and corporate stock market performance using an event study methodology and regression analysis. The statistical analysis performed showed that target firms experience a significant decline in share price upon filing and that both industry and nature of the lawsuit are significantly and negatively related to shareholder wealth. Essay Three drew upon social movement and social identity theories to develop and test a set of hypotheses on how secondary stakeholder groups select their targets for human rights-related civil lawsuits. The results of a logistic regression model offered support for the proposition that MNE targets are chosen based on both interest and identity factors. The results of these essays suggest that legal action initiated by secondary stakeholder groups is a new and salient threat to multinational business and that firms doing business in countries with weak political institutions should factor this into corporate planning and take steps to mitigate their exposure to such risks.",952671767,,Dissertations & Theses," Wernick, David AdamWernickAdamDavidWernick, David Adam",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2620181721 , 64044161 , 66569 , 9781267243362 , 3502128 , 3502128", Dissertation/Thesis, 2011, 9781267243362, English, English,,2011,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2011,https://search.proquest.com/docview/952671767?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management," Management , Studies , Political risk , Multinational corporations"," Social sciences , Legal activism , Multinational enterprises , Nongovernmental organizations , Reputation , Risk , Secondary stakeholders",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Secondary+stakeholders+as+agents+of+influence%3A+Three+essays+on+political+risk%2C+reputation%2C+and+multinational+performance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2011-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wernick%2C+David+Adam&amp;isbn=9781267243362&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Marx and the Cross: The Liberal Protestants Perspectives on Communism and its Practice in China (1918–1937),"Marxism was first introduced into China in the late nineteenth century by Christian missionaries, but it did not become a popular trend of thought and a political ideology until after the October Revolution in Soviet Russia. In 1921, the Chinese Communist Party was born, and Communism as a social political movement picked up momentum. Its influence expanded rapidly among the Chinese intellectuals, students, workers and peasants under the watchful eye of the Nationalists (Guomindang), the ruling party. Even among the Chinese Christians, there were quite a few sympathizers and followers despite the obvious contradictions and differences between the Communist doctrine and the Christian faith. To most Protestants, Communism's anti-religious stance, its pronouncement of materialism and atheism, seemed to be just the opposite of Christianity. Yet, some Chinese Christians, the liberals in particular, believed there were rooms for cooperation and co-existence, in theory as well in practice. This dissertation examines and analyses this Christian-Communist encounter in the Republic of China during era of Guomindang domination. The first part of this dissertation begins with an examination of the intellectual and political background of modern China searching for a political ideology and a role in the international world caught between Capitalism and Communism. It then analyses the Chinese Christians' attitudes toward both the Nationalists and the Communists. Generally Chinese Christians' attitude was more favorable towards the Guomindang and indeed Christianity thrived during the ""golden decade"" of the Nanjing government. But eventually many became disillusioned and turned to the other side. This study provides ample discussions and explanations to this twist and turn in the Christian discourse. Furthermore, this dissertation also presents an in-depth analysis of the Protestant Christians' views on Chinese Communism. In several areas the Chinese Christians saw the Communists as ""competitors"" and not dreadful enemies: In social reforms and in labour movements, in rural reconstruction and in rallying the youths. Through constant dialogue and interaction, and the vigorous political persuasion of the Communists, many Christians were drawn toward the Communists in the end.

It narrates how students used the political and social conditions of their country, state-sponsored violence, as well as the turbulent ambiance in the universities as the justification for embracing the armed struggle. It argues that while historical narratives on urban guerrilla movements in Mexico and Latin America have largely focused on the armed struggle aspect of each movement and followed a generalized view that revolutionaries were adventurist, lacked a political consciousness, and were agents of an international conspiracy, this dissertation proposed a different approach. By looking at the context in which these students-turned-revolutionaries formed their armed struggle against the Mexican government, how they broaden their notion of class struggle to include students, and re-thought their positionality, makes Mexico a unique study to understanding militancy in the 1970s. This project argues that students urban guerrillas were convinced the armed struggle was the only available option left to change the government, but also stressed they were engaging in an intellectual war against the state in which they had to become the dominate voice in the universities, a space they considered produced adherents of the state, before a revolution could be carried out.",1009052800,,Dissertations & Theses," Calderon, Fernando HerreraCalderonHerreraFernandoCalderon, Fernando Herrera",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2642251111 , 68738242 , 66569 , 9781267266392 , 3503143 , 3503143", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267266392, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1009052800?accountid=14496, 0336 Latin American history, 0336 Latin American history, 0336 Latin American history,, 0336 Latin American history, Latin American history," Social sciences , Cold war , Dirty war , Mexico , Political violence , Student radicalism , Urban guerrillas",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contesting+the+State+from+the+Ivory+Tower%3A+Student+Power%2C+Dirty%0AWar+and+the+Urban+Guerrilla+Experience+in+Mexico%2C+1965%E2%80%931982&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Calderon%2C+Fernando+Herrera&amp;isbn=9781267266392&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Latina Psyche at the Crossroads of Two Cultures,"Latinos are the largest minority group in the United States today, with over 50 million people, of whom 45% are women, and growing four times faster than all other groups combined.

I explore how children's everyday lives are marked not only by the hardships typically associated with poverty, but also by their need to respond to the dominant notions of childhood, family roles, and urban order that make them into symbols of underdevelopment. In particular, I argue that transnational discourses about the perniciousness of child labor, articulated through development agencies, NGOs, the Peruvian state, the media, and everyday interpersonal exchanges, perpetuate an idea of childhood that not only fails to correspond to the realities of the children that I came to know, but that reinscribes a view of them and their families as impediments to progress and thus available for diverse forms of moral intervention. I ground my analysis in a notion that I call ""public childhoods."" This concept draws attention to the ways that subjectivities form through intersecting mechanisms of power, in this sense capturing nuances that common terms such as ""street children"" and ""child laborer"" gloss over. Children, I show, are a symbolic site for the articulation of the kinds of classed, raced and gendered differences that characterize Lima's contemporary urban imaginary. As they bear the embodied effects of such discourses, I argue, children who work the streets also participate—if in subtle ways—in these everyday ideological struggles into which they are drawn. My dissertation is based on twenty-two months of fieldwork in Peru, in addition to several one- and two-month periods of preliminary and follow-up research. As an ethnographer, my research consisted primarily of accompanying children as they went about their daily routines. Beyond ""hanging out"" in their workspaces, which included a busy traffic intersection in an upper-middle class district and public buses, I also spent a great deal of time with the children's families, typically in their homes in Lima's shantytowns and working-class neighborhoods. I also attended meetings and otherwise participated in institutional spaces such as NGOs, social movements, Congressional hearings, and advocacy groups. Finally, in order to gain a more long-term perspective on discussions and policies involving childhood, I conducted research in Lima's historical archives.",1012288990,,Dissertations & Theses," Campoamor, Leigh M.CampoamorM.LeighCampoamor, Leigh M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2657986181 , 67817702 , 66569 , 9781267290038 , 3505093 , 3505093", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267290038, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1012288990?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Children , Family , Labor , Peru , Public , Street labor , Urban",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Public+Childhoods%3A+Street+Labor%2C+Family%2C+and+the+Politics+of+Progress+in+Peru&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Campoamor%2C+Leigh+M.&amp;isbn=9781267290038&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""(Re)Positioning Lebanese Feminist Discourse A Rhetorical Study of “Al-Raida” (Pioneer) Journal, 1976–1985","This study is a feminist historiography of Al-Raida , a Lebanese feminist journal introduced in 1976 by the Institute for Women's Studies in the Arab World at the Lebanese American University. This study recovers foundations of modern Lebanese feminist discourses as they are articulated in the journal by employing Foucauldian CDA as a means to trace discourse strands, or conversations, which include Family Planning, development, politics and narratives of the Lebanese civil war. This study explores, by situating each discourse strand within dominant and local historical contexts, the shifting rhetorical function of the journal through various historical moments. Tracing the dominant discourse strands within the first decade of the journal, this study rhetorically analyzes the ways in which arguments are positioned, research studies are presented, and methodologies are employed to forge viable solutions to Middle Eastern women's issues. First, the study traces the conversation on Family Planning in Lebanon and its relevance to the economic and social situation during the late 70s. Second, the study presents the shift in the early 80s towards a discourse on development and explores how Al-Raida presents the issue of development, attempts to define it, and in doing so outlines some of the concerns at this time, including illiteracy, access to health care, access to paid employment, and women's access to developmental opportunities. Third, the study presents the discourse in the mid-80s on the civil war in Lebanon and highlights Al-Raida 's rhetorical function by documenting trauma and war narratives through personal interviews, testimonies, and ethnographies. The shift in the methodologies of the research articles published in the first decade, from quantitative studies towards qualitative studies, indicates the journal is rhetorically situated within both the dominant international discourse and within the local context, exhibiting an ability to respond to the nuances in the local Lebanese women's movement while simultaneously maintaining international visibility.",1013441482,,Dissertations & Theses," Khoury, NicoleKhouryNicoleKhoury, Nicole",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2660292851 , 68125422 , 66569 , 9781267296153 , 3505374 , 3505374", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267296153, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1013441482?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0681 Rhetoric , 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0681 Rhetoric , 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies"," 0453 Womens studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0681 Rhetoric , 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies",," 0453 Womens studies , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0681 Rhetoric , 0708 Mass communications , 0733 Gender studies"," Womens studies , Middle Eastern Studies , Rhetoric , Mass communications , Gender studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Al-Raida , Arab , Feminism , Gender , Journal , Lebanon , Middle East , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%28Re%29Positioning+Lebanese+Feminist+Discourse+A+Rhetorical+Study+of+%E2%80%9CAl-Raida%E2%80%9D+%28Pioneer%29+Journal%2C+1976%E2%80%931985&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Khoury%2C+Nicole&amp;isbn=9781267296153&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Politics of Employment Insecurity: Globalization, Deindustrialization and the Welfare State","At the heart of debates about the effects of globalization and the service economy on the welfare state is the notion of employment insecurity. It is considered a key causal mechanism through which cross-border movements of capital, goods and services (globalization) and employment shifts from manufacturing to services (deindustrialization) affect social policy. However, empirical research on such a causal linkage has been markedly lacking. In many cases, employment insecurity has been simply assumed to be the causal mechanism at work behind the observed relationship between economic globalization or deindustrialization and governments' commitment to social protection. This dissertation brings the hidden causal mechanism to the fore by using employment protection both as an explanatory and a dependent variable. Employment protection, which refers to regulatory frameworks that govern hiring and firing, has a direct bearing on workers' job security and can capture the politics of labor market risks. This dissertation consists of two projects. First, it examines how globalization and the service economy affect employment protection. Second, it analyzes how employment protection influences institutions of social protection. Focusing on the preferences and political strength of skilled workers, I argue that the effects of international trade and the service economy on employment protection depend on the relative scarcity of skilled labor and on the patterns of employment shifts between industries. I also contend that whether employment insecurity leads to expanded social protection depends on the social policy preference of skilled workers, which in turn, is shaped by the skill distribution in the economy and by pre-existing social protection institutions. This study finds that employment protection is both a political response to external and internal economic changes and a driving force for social policy change. Moreover, it highlights different causal processes for developed and developing economies. It offers statistical evidence based on two extensive cross-national time-series datasets of employment protection in the OECD and Latin America, and uses a case study of South Korea as qualitative evidence to elucidate the underlying dynamics of its quantitative findings.",1014168990,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Hyun KyoungKimKyoungHyunKim, Hyun Kyoung",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2664282851 , 67238732 , 66569 , 9781267316004 , 3506225 , 3506225", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267316004, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1014168990?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0629 Labor relations , 0630 Public policy"," 0615 Political science , 0629 Labor relations , 0630 Public policy"," 0615 Political science , 0629 Labor relations , 0630 Public policy",," 0615 Political science , 0629 Labor relations , 0630 Public policy"," Political science , Labor relations , Public policy"," Social sciences , Deindustrialization , Globalization , Korea , Labor market , Welfare state",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Politics+of+Employment+Insecurity%3A+Globalization%2C+Deindustrialization+and+the+Welfare+State&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Hyun+Kyoung&amp;isbn=9781267316004&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The missiology of the Emerging church in Portland, Oregon","The Emerging church in Portland, Oregon, a hub for the Emerging church, as representative of the larger Emerging church movement is missiologically concerned with reaching the emerging culture, devoting its efforts to articulating new models of ministry through refining the expression of Christian beliefs, morality, and methodology to fit the emerging culture with an adequately contextualized gospel. Etic and Emic literature encompasses the fields of Mission to the West, Missional Studies, Theology of Mission, Congregational Studies and Worldview. Methods of data collection through observation of three Portland emerging churches and interviews are delineated and interview protocol is given. Coding, categorization and analysis of data is explained and findings are reported in a qualitative narrative. An overview of the philosophical development, historical development and definitions of the various groups within the greater Emerging church movement give insight into the Portland Emerging churches. The streams of the Emerging church fit into two primary categories: Emerging Evangelicals and Emergents. A brief history and cultural overview of Portland give context for the Emerging church's presence and influence in the Pacific Northwest. Demographics and church histories, rejected and accepted church models give background to explain the studied churches' transitional and contextual missiology as well as their neglect of ethnic minorities and subcultures. Sunday services and ministry activities of three Portland Emerging churches, Alpha, Beta and Gamma express their ideology and cultural identification with the emerging culture and high relational permeability. The churches practice a four-fold missiology, which consists of Internal church relationships, External community relationships, External city relationships, and International Mission relationships. They are engaging the emerging culture through social action, activities, relational connections, and church planting, limiting their scope to a few specific projects and/or regions/areas locally and globally. Findings reveal a shift in worldview from Modern to Postmodern and a consistency with the missiology of the larger Emerging church movement in terms of attraction and contextualization, while missing the results of significant spiritual conversions due to a lack of effective missiology.",1015170318,,Dissertations & Theses," Steele, Terrance S.SteeleS.TerranceSteele, Terrance S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2666932631 , 69338142 , 66569 , 9781267317636 , 3506358 , 3506358", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267317636, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1015170318?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0604 Regional Studies"," 0318 Religion , 0604 Regional Studies"," 0318 Religion , 0604 Regional Studies",," 0318 Religion , 0604 Regional Studies"," Religion , Regional Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Emerging church , Missiology , Oregon , Portland",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+missiology+of+the+Emerging+church+in+Portland%2C+Oregon&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Steele%2C+Terrance+S.&amp;isbn=9781267317636&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Culture, Politics and Neoliberalism: New Subjectivities and Representation in Argentina and Central America, 1990s–2000s","This dissertation is an interdisciplinary and comparative project that lies at the intersection of political economy and cultural production. Specifically, it explores the relationship between film and literature, and the consolidation and later crisis of neoliberalism as the dominant socio-economic system in Argentina and four countries of Central America (El Salvador, Guatemala, Nicaragua and Costa Rica) during the 1990s and early 2000s. The dissertation argues that the turn to neoliberalism implies a concurrent change in cultural production characterized by a shift in subjectivity, representation, and the relationship between politics and aesthetics, resulting in a reformulation of the critical possibilities of cultural texts in a historical moment characterized by a crisis of leftist political projects. As commodities within the global market themselves, cultural texts are able to unveil the contradictions, inequalities and tensions within neoliberalism, resisting its dominant logic, but at the same time appropriating and reformulating it in a variety of ways. By neoliberalism the dissertation means three things. First, a philosophy and theory of political economy that proposes individual wellbeing and national progress to be best advanced by an institutional framework characterized by strong private property rights, free markets, and free trade. Second, a set of specific policies such as privatization and the elimination of tariffs on the movement of capital and goods implemented by national governments and international organizations with concrete material effects. Third, the specific form of the late capitalist system that seeks to establish itself as the dominant global economic logic, but also as the basis for social relations in general. The dissertation organizes its exploration of the relationship between neoliberalism and cultural production in Argentina and Central America through five specific “interventions”, each one exploring a distinct, but interrelated, theme. The first chapter, written under the theme of “Money”, focuses on Argentina, specifically on the repercussions of neoliberal policies tied to the 1991 Convertibility Law, which pegs the Argentine peso to the dollar and establishes a complete liberalization of financial transactions to and from the country. The chapter analyzes the novel Plata quemada (1997) by Ricardo Piglia and the film Nueve reinas (2000) by Fabián Bielinsky as veiled critiques of the neoliberal 1990s, revealing through a critical association with criminality, the instability and inequality of a system that hides behind financial discourse, the actual reality of macroeconomic thievery. The second chapter focuses on postwar Central American fiction through the theme of “Disenchantment.” It consists of a critical exploration of the short novel El asco (1997) by Honduran/Salvadoran writer Horacio Castellanos Moya and the novel Managua, Salsa City (2000) by Nicaraguan/Guatemalan writer Franz Galich. The chapter challenges the characterization of these novels as pessimistic and cynical, arguing that they are in fact re-imagining the relation between politics and aesthetics in a new socioeconomic context. The third chapter, written under the theme of “Time,” concentrates on two films of the so-called New Argentine Cinema: La mujer sin cabeza (2008) by Lucrecia Martel and Bolivia (2001) by Adrián Caetano. Although in distinct ways, the chapter argues that both films develop a sense of time in direct opposition to the “accelerated time” commonly associated with global capitalism, thus challenging the imaginary of Argentina as urban, cosmopolitan and European through a temporal affective experience tied to those who are not integrated into the space-time of the global market. The fourth chapter, written in relation to the theme of “Violence”, discusses the novel El material humano (2009) by Guatemalan writer Rodrigo Rey Rosa and the short story collection Mediodía de frontera (2002) by Salvadoran writer Claudia Hernández in the context of a sharp rise in violence experienced by both countries during recent years. The chapter argues that partly due to this violence, and to a loss of faith in the neoliberal project as a whole, both works challenge the allegory as the dominant form of literary representation, searching for new paradigms of literary depiction. The fifth and final chapter, written under the theme of “Affect”, explores two contemporary Central American films: Agua fría de mar (2010) by Costarican director Paz Fábrega and Gasolina (2008) by Guatemalan director Julio Hernández. The chapter argues that both films construct an ambiguous affective sensibility that captures the uncertainty of a historical moment characterized by crisis and change, in which the promises of social development and progress under a neoliberal agenda have been severely challenged, but in which there is still no foreseeable alternative, nor maybe even the belief in one.

In particular, I examine recent novels by Native and Asian American authors, including Louise Erdrich's Four Souls (2004), Linda Hogan's Solar Storms (1995), Ruth Ozeki's My Year of Meats (1998), and Karen Yamashita's Tropic of Orange (1997) to show how a formal and thematic focus on storytelling allows these writers to scrutinize the role narratives play in perpetuating environmental injustice and to construct counter-narratives which encourage political self-consciousness and change. To account for the novels' metafictive political force, this project identifies four different models of metafiction, including ""trickster"" (Erdrich), ""trauma"" (Hogan), ""documentary"" (Ozeki), and ""hypercontextual"" (Yamashita), and then reveals how these models are used to negotiate specific environmental justice issues such as the exploitation of natural resources and hydroelectric damming on Native lands, factory farming, and urban degradation. Revising postmodern approaches to metafiction, I claim that these contemporary texts draw on alternative and ethnic storytelling/activist traditions not only to highlight the ""constructedness"" of narratives, but also the material effects of those constructions for people and environments. In so doing, this project critiques the mainstream environmental movement's tendency to ignore race, gender, class, and non-wilderness environments. Although environmental justice scholarship is expanding definitions of the environment to include toxic/built spaces, my project argues for the need to focus on the literary and cultural narratives about these landscapes in addition to gathering social and scientific data. Ultimately, I claim that metafiction, and the humanities more broadly, are especially suited to addressing environmental injustice because understanding this phenomenon requires us to reflect on the relationship between ""how"" we tell stories and ""how"" we act in the world.",1018421388,,Dissertations & Theses," Harrison, Summer GioiaHarrisonGioiaSummerHarrison, Summer Gioia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2677686351 , 69465772 , 66569 , 9781267345653 , 3508759 , 3508759", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267345653, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018421388?accountid=14496," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies",," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0740 Native American studies"," Asian American Studies , American literature , Environmental Justice , Ethnic studies , Native American studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Asian American literature , Environment , Environmental justice , Erdrich, Louise , Ethnic , Hogan, Linda , Metafiction , Native American literature , Ozeki, Ruth , Yamashita, Karen",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Environmental+justice+metafiction%3A+Narrative+and+politics+in+contemporary+ethnic+women%27s+novels+by+Louise+Erdrich%2C+Linda+Hogan%2C+Ruth+Ozeki%2C+and+Karen+Yamashita&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Harrison%2C+Summer+Gioia&amp;isbn=9781267345653&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Sport in development: A focus on leadership and human rights,"In the early decades of the 21 st century sport advocates began using sport as a tool for development in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMIC). Despite sport-in-development's rapid growth, there is a vacancy of scholarly research; this study contributes academic research that can deepen the understanding of sport-in-development in the larger development field. The purpose of this study is to reflect on the recent movement of sport-in-development, through the lens of United Nations human rights and development policy. A hermeneutic study of seven United Nations (UN) human rights documents was conducted to answer the research question, to what extent do human rights, according to the United Nations policy, inspire, encourage and shape sport-in-development? Four important themes were found in answering this research question. 1. Every human being has inherent dignity; 2. There are fundamental human rights and freedoms afforded all peoples; 3. The UN's role of the promotion of ""social progress and better standards of life in larger freedom"" (CRC, 1989); and 4. The promotion, maintenance and growth of international peace. Findings of this study connect the themes found in the UN human rights documents and the goals of sport-in-development proponents; both UN human rights and sport-in-development are focused on human development and capacity building as the foundation of developing communities and countries. Building programs founded on these themes can build continued support for sport in the larger development landscape, and build much needed connections between development organizations.",1018458738,,Dissertations & Theses," Higgs, HelenHiggsHelenHiggs, Helen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2677894171 , 69582152 , 66569 , 9781267353962 , 3510689 , 3510689", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267353962, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1018458738?accountid=14496," 0430 Sports Management , 0575 Kinesiology , 0680 Health education , 0700 Social structure"," 0430 Sports Management , 0575 Kinesiology , 0680 Health education , 0700 Social structure"," 0430 Sports Management , 0575 Kinesiology , 0680 Health education , 0700 Social structure",," 0430 Sports Management , 0575 Kinesiology , 0680 Health education , 0700 Social structure"," Sports Management , Kinesiology , Health education , Social structure , Studies , Human rights , Sports , Personal development , Economic development"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Education , Capacity building , Human rights , Sport-in-development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sport+in+development%3A+A+focus+on+leadership+and+human+rights&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Higgs%2C+Helen&amp;isbn=9781267353962&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Solidarity at the Margins: Literature, Film, and Justice in Neoliberal Argentina, Brazil and Chile","This dissertation investigates literature and film of post-dictatorship Argentina, Brazil and Chile. Certain political continuities and the implementation of neoliberal economic policies by transitional regimes, as well as the discrediting of leftist projects with the fall of the Soviet Union, left the opposition to these policies with few political alternatives. Although the severity and posterior influence of each country's dictatorship differed, many novels and films of the 1980s and 1990s reconstruct space in such a way that social ""others"" experience restricted movement or limited possibilities to act. Writers represent spaces in which marginalized characters operate as a labyrinth, as places physically removed from mainstream society, as racially separate, or as seemingly inescapable. In addition to the role of national politics and economics, international intervention plays a large part in the creation of restricting marginalized spaces. I argue that even as these works represent constrictive marginalized spaces, they also construct possibilities for social justice through bonds of solidarity that certain socially marginalized characters form with one another. Solidarity takes the form of communication, building relationships, sharing resources and, in its most developed form in the novels and films, political mobilization. I show how solidarity between characters must be intentional, as well as between society's marginalized as opposed to solely collaboration with an intellectual vanguard, in order to have the possibility of successful enactment of social justice. Together, these works call for a raised awareness of political, social and economic oppression even as proponents of the neoliberal model hail the economy as the way to access social incorporation. In a time period when there appeared to be few alternatives, these works suggest that a more equal distribution of wealth, resources and political power is not only possible, but that the potential lies within marginalized sectors in solidarity with each other.",1019966362,,Dissertations & Theses," Daniels, Jennie IreneDanielsIreneJennieDaniels, Jennie Irene",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2684762561 , 69377742 , 66569 , 9781267361363 , 3509565 , 3509565", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267361363, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1019966362?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0900 Film studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0900 Film studies",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0900 Film studies"," Latin American literature , Film studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Communication and the arts , Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Marginalization , Neoliberalism , Post-dictatorship , Solidarity , Southern Cone",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Solidarity+at+the+Margins%3A+Literature%2C+Film%2C+and+Justice+in+Neoliberal+Argentina%2C+Brazil+and+Chile&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Daniels%2C+Jennie+Irene&amp;isbn=9781267361363&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Bellydance in America: Strategies for Seeking Personal Transformation,"In this thesis I argue that bellydance serves as a site for practitioners to transform their sense of self, transgress social boundaries, and build community, but that this transformative potential is compromised when the Orientalist assumptions that have historically been embedded in the practice are not recognized or challenged. I begin by highlighting particularly salient moments in Egyptian and American bellydance history from the mid-19 th century to the mid-20 th century, emphasizing the intercultural exchange and sociopolitical factors at play during the form's transnational development. I then examine the choreographic and rhetorical strategies American bellydancers since the 1960s have employed in their attempts to access the transformative and transgressive potential of the dance. I show that these strategies have given rise to new genres that either uphold or combat the tendency in bellydance performance to represent essentialized notions of gender and ethnicity, ultimately revealing the form as a heterogeneous complex of practices that grows more self-reflexive and critical throughout its various formations. Through choreographic analysis of foundational bellydance movement vocabulary and the organizational structures of Improvisational Tribal Style I explore how engaging with the physical practice of bellydance can allow people to expand their sense of self beyond societally-imposed boundaries and to form inter-subjective community. I conclude by raising concerns about issues of representation in American bellydance, questioning the discourse of authenticity, and offering some considerations for charting a course ahead.",1021725434,,Dissertations & Theses," Burnam, April RoseBurnamRoseAprilBurnam, April Rose",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2693777931 , 70008592 , 66569 , 9781267388384 , 1512027 , 1512027", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267388384, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1021725434?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance",," 0323 American studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," American studies , Cultural anthropology , Dance"," Communication and the arts , Social sciences , Autoethnography , Belly dance , Bellydance , Choreographic analysis , Egyptian dance , Postcolonial",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bellydance+in+America%3A+Strategies+for+Seeking+Personal+Transformation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burnam%2C+April+Rose&amp;isbn=9781267388384&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Imagining climate change: Towards understanding Chinese citizenship,"This dissertation theorizes how youth in China, a nation that is now the greatest emitter of greenhouse gases associated with climate change, make sense of climate change in their daily lives. Chapter one outlines the theories that this dissertation is in conversation with; theories of citizenship, identity, media and social movements. In chapter two I argue that it is important to recognize the existence of networks of domestic and international state and non-state environmental actors and offer a historical explanation for their emergence. Chapters three, four and five test the three hypotheses developed in chapter one that: a) Chinese youth learn about climate change; b) figure out one's responsibility for solving the problem; c) take action as they deem appropriate. Chapter three outlines how Chinese youth learn about climate change in multiple ways through mediated, social and physical experience. Chapter four looks at the question of responsibility, or sharing one's burden as a citizen. This chapter illustrates that Chinese youth are trying to figure out responsibility for climate change at a time when the Chinese state is increasingly relinquishing responsibility for social welfare. Chapter five uses a litmus test of actions, based on existing scholarly work and actions commonly promoted by environmental protection organizations, to reveal the degree to which Chinese youth take actions that might go towards mitigating climate change. This chapter also looks at why action is taken and demonstrates that Chinese youth take part in actions often without personally making any linkages between climate change and a sense of responsibility. This chapter demonstrates that it is important to better understand the relationship between climate change and realizing the modern life in China. The final chapter, the conclusion, suggests that by looking at the daily lives of Chinese youth that this dissertation not only contributes to work looking at questions of climate change but also efforts to understand contemporary life in China. The dissertation is based on a self-administered Chinese language survey, bi-lingual interviews, participate observations, and primary sources from the academic, government, NGO and private sectors.",1022333873,,Dissertations & Theses," Eberhardt, ChristopherEberhardtChristopherEberhardt, Christopher",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2697673791 , 67710992 , 66569 , 9781267387158 , 3511231 , 3511231", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267387158, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1022333873?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0626 Sociology"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0626 Sociology"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0626 Sociology",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0626 Sociology"," Asian Studies , Environmental philosophy , Sociology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , China , Chinese youth , Climate change , Networks , Public sphere , Responsibility",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Imagining+climate+change%3A+Towards+understanding+Chinese+citizenship&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Eberhardt%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=9781267387158&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Development of a Framework to Assess Sustainability of Building Projects,"The last three decades witnessed a global shift in focus towards sustainable development, primarily owing to the effects of human activities on planet earth. The resultant sustainability movement, which originated in the 1980's, has been acknowledged universally as the response to environmental, social and economic concerns facing most nations. Sustainable development, a concept which meets the needs of today without compromising the needs of future generations, is being made use of for almost all activities ranging from international mega ventures to individual projects. In this context, the building industry, which makes a significant impact on the social, environmental and economic well-being of the society, has a prime responsibility in meeting with sustainability requirements in all facets of the design, construction and operation of buildings. The concepts of green building, environmental impact assessments and the building environmental assessment methods are several means of addressing these issues, but are considered as inadequate to contend with the wider spectrum of sustainability. Currently efforts are being made by the building industry and the allied professions to adhere to sustainability norms by enhancing the current green building practices. The formulation of a measurement system to appraise the sustainability of a building project, as being attempted through this research, is one such effort at meeting with the global demand for sustainability. The inspiration for the research is created by the current sustainability efforts of the building industry, while the theoretical connotations of building design processes and existing building performance measurement systems are used as a springboard for the execution of this research. The feedback from professionals in building and allied industries makes a vital contribution in the formulation of the framework for the measurement system. While the proposed sustainability assessment framework is expected to be utilized as a tool to gauge the extent of sustainability of a building project, with time it could be further enhanced in order to keep abreast with demands of the industry. The research contributes towards formulating a best practices methodology for design of sustainable building projects, and the success of such an exercise is primarily attributed to the ability of the assessment system to serve as a guideline to deliver sustainable buildings. In order to address such concerns, the means of integrating the assessment method with a selected segment of the project delivery process is demonstrated, so that it can also serve as an application tool in the design of sustainable buildings. Accordingly, this research ventures into allied domains in the building industry, and it opens up several avenues for further research in future. The final outcome of the research is a framework for a sustainability assessment method that could be applied by owners and design teams seeking high quality, sustainable buildings as the final output of their endeavours.",1022503533,,Dissertations & Theses," Weerasinghe, Udawattage Gamini DharmagupthaWeerasingheGamini DharmagupthaUdawattageWeerasinghe, Udawattage Gamini Dharmaguptha",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2698612491 , 70124772 , 66569 , 9780494835517 , NR83551 , NR83551", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780494835517, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1022503533?accountid=14496," 0462 Architectural , 0543 Civil engineering , 0640 Sustainability"," 0462 Architectural , 0543 Civil engineering , 0640 Sustainability"," 0462 Architectural , 0543 Civil engineering , 0640 Sustainability",," 0462 Architectural , 0543 Civil engineering , 0640 Sustainability"," Architectural , Civil engineering , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Building projects , Sustainable development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Development+of+a+Framework+to+Assess+Sustainability+of+Building+Projects&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Weerasinghe%2C+Udawattage+Gamini+Dharmaguptha&amp;isbn=9780494835517&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Latino immigrants' responses to immigration policy and enforcement: Strengths and resources promoting empowerment and wellness in an urban setting,"This research employed ecological and participatory perspectives on mental health principles to examine the impact of increased Immigration and Customs Enforcement on the lived experiences of Latino immigrants in Chelsea, Massachusetts, the personal and community responses to increased enforcement, and the role of community-based resources in protecting personal and family wellness. Participants were fifteen adults who self-identified as Latino immigrants concerned about impacts of increased ICE enforcement, born in Central America, Colombia, and Puerto Rico. Although the two Puerto Rican participants are not immigrants by definition, both identified as immigrants and illustrate the impact of enforcement on a wider range of residents in mixed status families and communities. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis, complemented by participatory methods. Findings suggest that experiences associated with immigration status or identities intersected with multiple interconnected social dimensions such as gender, sexual orientation, race, age at immigration, documentation status, and socio-economic status. Ballou's (2002) feminist ecological model and Prilleltensky's (2008) psychopolitical model of wellness were employed to organize the themes in participant narratives as they described experienced barriers and reclaimed power at intersections of immigration concerns and other systemic contexts. Participants identified their journeys towards reclaiming power/agency in their lives as movement towards wellness, or towards realizing family goals. . Mental health needs, symptoms, or emotional expressions were understood in relationship to this construct of power—so that being able or unable exercise agency in their environments was critical in generating what are sometimes considered private or personal emotional/psychological states. The ecological contexts impacting individual experience were organized as: (1) Individual, (2) Family, (3) City of Chelsea, (4) United States/Federal Immigration Policy, and (5) Global/Country of Origin. Within each ecological level participants identified challenges/oppressive forces as well as strengths/resources. These findings suggest that immigrant mental health services need to consider contextual resources for empowerment in promoting personal, family and community wellness. Results will be shared with community partners to inform mental health and Social Service components of a community-based organization's responses to immigration enforcement , and their ongoing work promoting personal and community wellness.",1022644809,,Dissertations & Theses," Atallah-Gutierrez, CelesteAtallah-GutierrezCelesteAtallah-Gutierrez, Celeste",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2699499741 , 66884672 , 66569 , 9781267388278 , 3511264 , 3511264", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267388278, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1022644809?accountid=14496, 0622 Clinical psychology, 0622 Clinical psychology, 0622 Clinical psychology,, 0622 Clinical psychology, Clinical psychology," Psychology , Ecological framework , Immigration enforcement , Immigration policy , Latino immigrants , Participatory action research , Urban setting",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Latino+immigrants%27+responses+to+immigration+policy+and+enforcement%3A+Strengths+and+resources+promoting+empowerment+and+wellness+in+an+urban+setting&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Atallah-Gutierrez%2C+Celeste&amp;isbn=9781267388278&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Dangerous Acts: A Transnational Study of Gendered Passing and Performance,"""Dangerous Acts: A Transnational Study of Gendered Passing and Performance"" explores gender-related passing in three Latin American narratives: Flora Tristán's Pérégrinations d'une paria ; Manuel Puig's El beso de la mujer araña ; and Sergio Bizzio's ""Cinismo,"" along with Lucía Puenzo's film adaptation XXY . This dissertation stems from an interest in `passing' as expressed in 20 th century US narratives, particularly those dealing with racial passing. The scholarship of gender-related passing is not nearly as developed as that of racial passing; thus, my exploration looks to the theoretical hallmarks of scholarship relating to passing in US literature while acknowledging that racial theories cannot simply be transferred to issues of gender and sexuality. In my exploration, I have discovered four key areas where the traditional concept of ""passing"" fails for the types of performativity figures enact in these narratives. I have developed the term transmutativity to express the type of performativity, performance, and passing I see these subjects undertaking. Relying heavily on the theories of Werner Sollors, Judith Butler, Michel Foucault, Eve Sedgwick, and others, my concept of transmutativity is designed to more accurately express the `illusion of compliance' that is effected when disenfranchised subjects are able to create a certain space of safety and freedom by electing to performatively submit to normative expectations in other areas. As Tristán and Molina (of El beso de la mujer araña ) show us, the safe space created by transmutativity is one of enormous potential: for creativity, for physical, social, and class movement, and for subversion of power. These figures illustrate, in fictional and non-fictional narratives, that truth can be found in performance, that one can be imprisoned in free society, and that one can be free in a prison. By challenging our definitions of identity categories, including what being male and female actually is, transmutative subjects offer an avenue of enormous potential for social and individual progress that crosses boundaries of era, nation, and language.",1023132485,,Dissertations & Theses," Skwiot, Elizabeth RuthSkwiotRuthElizabethSkwiot, Elizabeth Ruth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2701971351 , 70206062 , 66569 , 9781267401021 , 3511874 , 3511874", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267401021, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1023132485?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Comparative literature , Latin American literature , Womens studies , Gender studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Gendered passing , Passing , Performativity , Racial passing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dangerous+Acts%3A+A+Transnational+Study+of+Gendered+Passing+and+Performance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Skwiot%2C+Elizabeth+Ruth&amp;isbn=9781267401021&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Seismic hazard assessment of northeastern India,"Natural hazards, particularly earthquakes usually occur without warning. Although the occurrence of earthquake is inevitable, the reduction of social and economic setback during earthquake can be achieved through a comprehensive assessment of seismic hazard and risk reduction. The present study region, Northeastern (NE) India, is known for its high level of seismicity and complex tectonic features. The seismic zonation map of India has demarcated the NE India as Zone V and Global Seismic Hazard Assessment has estimated high seismic risk in this region with peak ground acceleration of 0.35g–0.4g. This region has experienced 20 large earthquakes (M w &gt; 7.0) since 1897, including two great earthquakes of magnitude M w 8.1 in 1897 and M w 8.5 in 1950. Due to these earthquakes, NE region has experienced loss of life and property, severe building collapse and intense ground shaking. Moreover the rapid urbanization, increasing population density, the loss of human live and properties due to recent past devastating earthquakes, demand research studies on seismic hazard assessment and risk analysis. For the present study, a reliable, homogeneous and complete earthquake catalogue with a cutoff moment magnitude M w ≥3.0 for NE region is prepared covering the period from 1897 to 2009, which is the essential input parameter to estimate seismic hazard assessment. Pattern Informatics (PI) and Relative Intensity (RI) methods are applied for earthquake forecasting and seismic hazard assessment. Both the PI and RI methods are performed for a grid size of 0.2° × 0.2° with cutoff magnitude M w ≥ 3 during the time period from t 0 =1897 to t 3 =2009. The results obtained from the PI method are evaluated using relative operating characteristic (ROC) diagram. The hotspots or the possible site for future earthquakes include 39 boxes out of the 2750 boxes considered for NE region. Further, the NE region is divided in to three zones namely Zone 1: Arakan-Yoma Zone (AYZ), Zone 2: Himalayan Zone (HZ) and Zone 3: Shillong Plateau Zone (SPZ) based on seismicity and tectonics. Energy blocked in these regions is calculated to estimate the maximum magnitudes ( M max ). The M max obtained for source zones are 8.2 for AYZ, 8.6 for HZ, and 8.7 for SPZ. Two first order Markov models have been used in the above source zones in the temporal domain to compute the seismic hazard analysis. The result depicts that AYZ is the most prone to experiencing large earthquakes among all the three zones in the near future. In the present study, the relative movements in NE India is estimated from the Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) image and correlated with the continuous recorded Global Positioning System (GPS) data obtained from the NE GPS network. The InSAR is prepared to find out the relative movements of the particular region and quite well correlates with GPS findings. This InSAR result suggests continuous relative movements in NE region and hence accumulation strain which will be responsible for future earthquakes.

Through participant observation in the families' households and neighborhood, artifact collection, and individual and group interviews, I observe, document, and examine the everyday literacy practices of these three families in order to understand how these literacies are used to foster new understandings and social networks while maintaining transnational connections. The data analysis demonstrates that there are similarities and differences between the literacy practices and language choices of the sixteen individuals who participated and that there are significant differences across generations as well as across the three families. The findings shed light on the complicated relationship between migration and language learning, ideologies of language, literacy practices, and various modes of communication (face-to-face and digital). Building on a long tradition of ethnographic work that examines language learning and literacy in relation to educational access and opportunity, this research is relevant to educational researchers, policy makers, and teachers who are committed to rethinking what counts as literacy, for whom, in what contexts, and with what kinds of consequences. In a time of increased movement of people across borders, and increased use of information and communication technologies, this investigation has important implications for teacher preparation, theories of language learning and literacy development, and educational research.",1025739579,,Dissertations & Theses," Duran, Chatwara SuwannamaiDuranSuwannamaiChatwaraDuran, Chatwara Suwannamai",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2711835451 , 69229072 , 66569 , 9781267433299 , 3513251 , 3513251", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267433299, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1025739579?accountid=14496," 0282 Bilingual education , 0290 Linguistics , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0290 Linguistics , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0290 Linguistics , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0636 Sociolinguistics",," 0282 Bilingual education , 0290 Linguistics , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," Bilingual education , Linguistics , Individual & family studies , Sociolinguistics"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Education , Burma , Karenni , Literacy , Multilingualism , Refugees , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Study+of+Multilingual+Repertoires+and+Accumulated+Literacies%3A+Three+Karenni+Families+Living+in+Arizona&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Duran%2C+Chatwara+Suwannamai&amp;isbn=9781267433299&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Playing the nation in a colonial island: Sport, culture, and politics in Puerto Rico","This dissertation demonstrates the way in which sport was intrinsically involved in both colonial politics and the formation of a national identity in Puerto Rico between 1898 and 1966. The efforts to develop sport in its institutional organization, ideological constructs, and infrastructural capacities entailed at the same time a desire to raise the island's level of modernization and overcome centuries of colonial peripheral anonymity. By studying not only how sport became institutionalized on the island, but also how the Olympic movement developed, I provide a better understanding of how sport play a profound role in the political and cultural processes of identity imbued in U.S. colonialism, which I call Colonial Olympism. In this regard, Puerto Rico, as the only Latin American nation belonging to the U.S., constitutes a unique and problematic case, too often overlooked. The accounts presented in this dissertation show that the process of developing sport institutions and programs in Puerto Rico resulted in two distinctive and problematic consequences: first, the continuation of colonialism, and second, the consolidation of a colonial national identity. That is, I will prove that the process of the creation of institutions that organized, regulated, and developed athletic and recreational activities allowed for the perpetuation of a colonial relationship due to the effective social justice platform and pro-American populism of the Popular Democratic Party and its political offspring, the Commonwealth. Having international athletic representation as a Caribbean and Latin American nation and at the same time being U.S. citizens represented the best of both worlds, making the colonial problems of the territorial clauses of the Commonwealth of secondary importance, thus solidifying Colonial Olympism. While emphasis will be placed on institutions of sport, this should not be taken as a study devoid from attention to groups and individuals, both elite and non-elite, who were the protagonists of the development of these institutions. Therefore, at the center of this modernization of sport lies an intense negotiation between key individuals and groups, all claiming to help Puerto Rican society to progress. The focus of this study will mainly fall in the twentieth century. While games and sports have been present in Puerto Rico since the Spanish colonial period, it was with the U.S. invasion in 1898 that sport became popularly practiced and governmentally sponsored through the creation of a new public island-wide education system, the University of Puerto Rico (1903), and their athletic and physical education programs. By hosting in 1966 the Tenth Central American and Caribbean Games in San Juan, the first time hosting an international athletic event of this magnitude, Puerto Ricans had consolidated their sport culture in its relation to their political organization, modernization program, and development of a national identity. Hence a rough chronological period for this dissertation falls between 1898 and 1966. However, the road to the development of sport was not an easy one. Puerto Rican economy was never fully solvent and efforts of modernization always faced shortage of supplies and the realities of Caribbean underdevelopment. In this regard, developing athletics has been a constant political and economic challenge for all parties involved. Moreover, the particularities of Puerto Rico's relationship to the U.S. has been a source of conflict, resentment, and dissension not only locally, but also at the U.S., Latin American, and international levels. Furthermore, Puerto Rico's colonial relation to the U.S. has made the development of a national identity through sport somewhat ambivalent, though by the end of the 1960s it had produced a strong and stable source of nationalism, still alive and well in the present. Finally, drawing from a diverse array of secondary sources and the critical analysis of newspapers; personal and Olympic Games' memoirs and bulletins; governor and budget reports; official correspondence; government agency's advertisement publications and reports; third party studies; and interviews, this dissertation proves that the development of sport in Puerto Rico constituted a politico-cultural process with ramifications extended well beyond its shores. Puerto Rican sport, rather than encapsulated within the limits of the island, was paramount to the U.S.'s hegemonic project in the Caribbean, Latin America, and even on a global scale was involved in issues such as the Good Neighbor policy, the Cold War, and international decolonization movements. Puerto Rico's uniqueness as a Latin American nation belonging to the U.S., therefore, constitutes a premier case to observe the development of non-sovereign nationalism and Colonial Olympism. Lastly, this study constitutes a major contribution not only to the historiography of Puerto Rican and Latin American sports, politics, and identity, but is an indispensable work in the comprehension of the U.S.'s foreign policy and Empire building.",1026928382,,Dissertations & Theses," Sotomayor Carlo, AntonioSotomayor CarloAntonioSotomayor Carlo, Antonio",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715108041 , 70623372 , 66569 , 9781267439482 , 3513597 , 3513597", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267439482, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026928382?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0814 Recreation"," 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0814 Recreation"," 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0814 Recreation",," 0336 Latin American history , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science , 0814 Recreation"," Latin American history , Caribbean Studies , Latin American Studies , Political science , Recreation"," Social sciences , Colonialism , National identity , Olympic history , Puerto Rico , Spanish Caribbean , Sports , Sports history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Playing+the+nation+in+a+colonial+island%3A+Sport%2C+culture%2C+and+politics+in+Puerto+Rico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sotomayor+Carlo%2C+Antonio&amp;isbn=9781267439482&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Enduring Crisis, Ensuring Survival: Artistry, Economics, and the American Symphony Orchestra","Long considered one of the western world's cultural treasures, the symphony orchestra's artistic significance belies an institutional history replete with unsolved paradoxes. Since at least 1900, the classical performing arts have struggled to reconcile artistic creation with economic and cultural sustainability. This tension is rooted in a variety of management models that employ distinct ownership structures, revenue streams, and artistic ideologies. Along with various other factors, these models have played a decisive though often ignored role in determining artistic practices and audience reception, especially in America. My dissertation argues that the organizational structure employed by orchestras since the late-nineteenth century is fundamental to understanding the challenges they face today. Drawing from the domains of historical musicology and organizational theory, this project uses the analytic lens of structure—including governance arrangements, financial systems, social hierarchies, institutional logics, and artistic initiatives—to explain the orchestra's turbulent yet resilient history. Chapter 1 develops a framework to demonstrate how structure has influenced orchestral culture and performance practice. Several early operating models are introduced and compared to the corporate structure adopted by twentieth-century American orchestras. Chapter 2 explores the New York Philharmonic's evolution from a musician-owned-and-managed cooperative to a board-governed nonprofit, a transition shaped by the ideals—and wallets—of a new philanthropic elite. Chapter 3 scrutinizes the Louisville Orchestra New Music Project (1948-58), which supported over one hundred world premieres and inspired a shift in how orchestras foster the creation of contemporary music. Chapter 4 examines the development of a global youth orchestra movement, El Sistema, whose recent transplantation to the U.S. highlights a conflict between traditional definitions of artistic excellence, commercial viability, and social change. The dissertation concludes by synthesizing these strains of evidence and positing some solutions for the orchestra's contemporary challenges, connecting past and present to uncover new perspectives on high art music in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries.",1026970763,,Dissertations & Theses," Mauskapf, Michael G.MauskapfG.MichaelMauskapf, Michael G.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2715417671 , 70634112 , 66569 , 9781267468376 , 3519659 , 3519659", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267468376, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1026970763?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0413 Music , 0635 Organization Theory"," 0337 American history , 0413 Music , 0635 Organization Theory"," 0337 American history , 0413 Music , 0635 Organization Theory",," 0337 American history , 0413 Music , 0635 Organization Theory"," American history , Music , Organization Theory"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , American , El Sistema , Louisville Orchestra , Musicology , New York Philharmonic , Organizational structure , Symphony orchestra",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Enduring+Crisis%2C+Ensuring+Survival%3A++Artistry%2C+Economics%2C+and+the+American+Symphony+Orchestra&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mauskapf%2C+Michael+G.&amp;isbn=9781267468376&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"International volunteerism and the quest for world peace: A case study of the Quinta,"International volunteerism, by facilitating multinational work projects, seeks to achieve world peace through cultural interaction, education, and understanding.

In the present analysis, I focus on individuals' social identity and their positions as both volunteers and national representatives, claiming individuals struggled to internalize both of these role identities. In turn, I also scrutinized the volunteer project by examining its group dynamics, arguing they displayed a continuum between cooperation and conflict.

Taking into account that public policies have a differential impact on men and women, they become a key element in promoting equal opportunities and gender mainstreaming in public policies. A gender responsive budget (GRB) implies that both the goals and the budget allocation tries to meet those differing needs, generating greater transparency, accountability and a more efficient allocation of resources. However, there are yet many challenges faced when promoting them. Rosario is a city located in Santa Fe Province, Argentina and it is the third most populated city in the country. It is also the city with the longest uninterrupted succession of socialist governments in Latin-America. It has a long story on gender policies and now GRB is in its institutional agenda. There are different actors and processes that have influenced this phenomenon: the learning process generated by the Participative Budgeting program, the incidence of the women movement, the articulation with the global gender agenda, and the ideology of the governmental party. The primary research question of this thesis seeks to identify how those processes and actors influenced the incorporation of GRB in the institutional agenda of Rosario City, by describing and analyzing the initiatives already undertaken. The project is conducted as a case study and the research implicated a fieldwork based on interviews with different governmental agents and other citizens. The results obtained demonstrate that these four processes were certainly present in advancing the issue of GRB in Rosario. The analysis showed that domestic Participative Budgeting and the party ideology opened participation channels and sensitized the different actors becoming the gateway for the emergence of the issue. Meanwhile, women's movement and the gender global agenda (represented by international organizations) had a direct impact on this process, pushing the issue into the agenda. It can be said that all these processes were combined in a complex and contingent way resulting in the entrance of GRB in the Rosario Municipality agenda.",1030437990,,Dissertations & Theses," Acuna, Maria MagdalenaAcunaMagdalenaMariaAcuna, Maria Magdalena",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2725966571 , 68351012 , 66569 , 9781267465528 , 1514607 , 1514607", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267465528, Spanish, Spanish,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1030437990?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration"," 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration"," 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration",," 0615 Political science , 0617 Public administration"," Political science , Public administration"," Social sciences , Actores , Género , Presupuesto , Procesos , Rosario , Sensible",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Presupuesto+sensible+al+g%C3%A9nero+en+Rosario%3A+Una+mirada%0Aa+los+actores%2C+los+procesos+y+las+ideas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Acuna%2C+Maria+Magdalena&amp;isbn=9781267465528&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Más allá de los imaginarios neoliberales: Espacio urbano, escritura, y justicia social en Chile y Cuba, 1990–2008","This dissertation examines literary representations of the neoliberal transformations of urban space in Santiago, Chile and Havana, Cuba since the 1990s. It draws on the influential work of scholars who argue that throughout the later part of the twentieth century cities have acquired important significance as spaces that register the conflicts that emerge in national contexts and are perpetuated on a global scale by neoliberalism. This dissertation evaluates how the urban imaginaries of Santiago and Cuba have been reshaped since 1990 as a neoliberal reconfiguration of urban space has taken place in each city as a result of important transitions that occur after political and economic crises that have strongly impacted social justice debates. In the Chilean context, it focuses on how neoliberalism was institutionalized with the political transition from a dictatorship to a democracy. In the Cuban context, it focuses on how amidst the economic crisis of the special period, the State began to transition from a socialist planned economy to a mixed system that integrates partially neoliberal policies. This dissertation analyzes how the discourse of the neoliberal market imposes a neoliberal imaginary of Chile as a neoliberal paradise and Cuba as a revolution in ruins. Thus this dissertation examines how those imaginaries are dismantled in Cuban and Chilean literary production. Chapter one analyzes literary representations of the social production of the city in Nancy Alonso's Tirar la primera piedra (Cuba, 1997), Ramón Díaz Eterovic's La oscura memoria de las armas (Chile, 2008), Pedro Lemebel's De perlas y cicatrices: crónicas radiales (Chile, 1998), and Ena Lucía Portela's Cien botellas en una pared (Cuba, 2002). The chapter evaluates how the texts intervene in the social production of postdictatorship Santiago and special period Havana by establishing a relationship between memory, time, and space that opposes the dominant conceptions of these that are established through the neoliberal reconfiguration of urban space. It argues that the texts re-write the city to re-think the possibilities for social change by theorizing memory as a vehicle that constantly elucidates an oppositional re-mapping of the city. Chapter two analyzes literary representations of the act of writing the city in Roberto Bolaño's Estrella distante (Chile, 1996), Díaz Eterovic's La oscura memoria de las armas , Ena Lucía Portela's Cien botellas en una pared , and Anna Lidia Vega Serova's Noche de ronda (Cuba, 2001). The chapter revisits the foundational relationship between writing and power in Latin America to examine transformations in the texts' literary depictions of how intellectuals map out Santiago and Havana. It contends that by tracing the relationship between those transformations and the economic and political transformations that have taken place in Chile and Cuba since 1990, the texts situate themselves at the margins of the State and the market as a strategy toward social justice that proposes an alternate relationship to power and knowledge. Chapter three analyzes the literary construction of the act of walking in Alonso's Tirar la primera piedra , Lemebel's De perlas y cicatrices: crónicas radiales , Karla Suárez's Silencios (Cuba, 1997), and Diamela Eltit's Jamás el fuego nunca (Chile, 2007). The chapter reviews foundational theorizations of the construction of the urban walker to understand the ways in which the neoliberal reconfiguration of postdictatorship Santiago and special period Cuba determines the characters' movement through those cities. It argues that as the characters walk through Santiago and Havana documenting the changes—forms of justice and injustice—that have taken place since 1990, they not only identify different forms of marginality that have emerged both in public and private spaces but also represent how the reconstruction of urban space inevitably redefines their identities. This dissertation concludes with an analysis of how debates on justice became a central focus in Chile and Cuba since the mid-twentieth century. It explores the ways in which those debates were impacted in Chile by the military coup d'état that in 1973 established the dictatorship as the embodiment of injustice, and in Cuba as the success of the 1959 Cuban Revolution was seen as the triumph of justice. It explores how the works make significant interventions in current social justice debates in each country through their focus on the neoliberal reconfiguration of the city. The conclusion argues that the texts dismantle the neoliberal imaginaries of Chile and Cuba to open a space for new theorizations of social justice beyond the limits of the market and the State. It contends that in refuting the neoliberal reconfiguration of their cities the texts propose alternate relationships between time, space, and memory that represent a possibility to conceptualize social justice not as a closed project imposed from above but as a struggle from below that must constantly be redefined to address diverse injustices.

Since its emergence as a tool for development in the 1970 microlending has become a key tactic for many developing countries in their attempt to reduce poverty and improve the lives of the poor. With the arrival of the global recession, however, the weaknesses of this strategy were highlighted as growing numbers of individuals around the globe struggled to make payments on their microloans. Faced with shame, loss of land and property, or jail, debtors around the globe responded to their situations in very different ways. In Nicaragua they turned to protest. Based on fourteen months of fieldwork, but drawing on twelve years of experience in the community, this study examines the strategies used by households in a small farming community to make ends meet and deal with the high levels of risk inherent in a subsistence economy in the wake of the collapse of the microfinance industry in the country. Central to this is the recognition of the constantly shifting political and economic terrain of Nicaragua and its influence on the everyday lives of citizens. What emerged as a key component of the research was the role of the Citizens Power Council (CPC), the community level government, as a major force in the community. Through the examination of multiple processes of power and governmentality the CPC emerges as an important tool of the state able to influence political and economic decisions of community members. With the ethnographic exploration of two ongoing social movements the power held by the CPC is revealed in their attempt to manipulate civil society at the ground level. The ability of the state to influence social movements is examined and the potential ramifications are discussed. Situating this research within the realm of political economy, development, and the pink tide that is currently sweeping Latin America, this study emphasizes the importance of contextualization and highlights the central role of ethnography in understanding what is happening on the ground with development projects and programs.",1030968557,,Dissertations & Theses," Kurlanska, Courtney BrookeKurlanskaBrookeCourtneyKurlanska, Courtney Brooke",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2727893751 , 69691082 , 66569 , 9781267473066 , 3517205 , 3517205", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267473066, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1030968557?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics"," Cultural anthropology , Agricultural economics"," Social sciences , Development , Governmentality , Microfinance , Nicaragua , Political economy , Risk , Rural finance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Grains%2C+greenbacks+and+governance%3A++The+political+economy+of+rural+microfinance+in+Nicaragua&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kurlanska%2C+Courtney+Brooke&amp;isbn=9781267473066&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"From the Streets to the World: New Perspectives of Graffiti and Street Art,"This thesis will describe different aspects of graffiti and street art and the way they collide and/or converge with its commercialization.

I argue that elite tracksters, a marginalized subset among women and athletes alike, used existing social networks and movements to advocate both cultural acceptance and political advances for women. My research reveals that women athletes in a broad range of roles—as undergraduates at black southern colleges, members of urban ethnic and religious track teams, civil rights activists, and international representatives of Cold War democracy—emphasized their femininity and skill to counter Americans' belief that female competitors transgressed acceptable social mores. Olympic athletes positioned themselves as ""foxes, not oxes"" even as they prioritized sport, gradually expanding Americans' understanding of gender roles. As U.S. State Department goodwill ambassadors, they engaged in cultural diplomacy. After Title IX codified sex equality in education, athletes weathered a demographic realignment in women's track and allied with mainstream feminists to advocate women's professional sport. While neither U.S. historians nor gender specialists have fully addressed these alternative forms of activism, the close examination of women athletes' social and political advocacy reveals new insights into women's rights efforts outside mainstream feminist ""waves"" and the role of gender in segregated education, urban community networks, and Cold War cultural diplomacy. This project connects U.S. political history, gender studies, education, and international relations, illuminating new facets of each. Uncovering a diverse network of women athletes, Racing to Win reveals the benefit of tracing interracial, ethnic, and religious connections in women's political history in alternative cultural channels like sport. Black women have served as models of American femininity in very few contexts. My research reveals that as athletes, they set the standard for how women should present themselves as national representatives at home and abroad after 1928. This dissertation explores alliances and relationships historians have overlooked to show how women's sport, a subject seemingly peripheral to historical analysis of national political culture and society, illuminates new insights about these central forces.",1033072212,,Dissertations & Theses," Blaschke, Anne MarcelleBlaschkeMarcelleAnneBlaschke, Anne Marcelle",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2733907901 , 65447481 , 66569 , 9781267520708 , 3520300 , 3520300", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267520708, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1033072212?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies",," 0337 American history , 0453 Womens studies"," American history , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Cultural diplomacy , Gender , Political culture , Race , Sport , Track and field , Women athletes",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Racing+to+win%3A+Women+track+and+field+athletes+in+American+political+culture%2C+1928%E2%80%931978&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blaschke%2C+Anne+Marcelle&amp;isbn=9781267520708&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Fusing Identities and Mobilizing Resistance in Chiapas and Mexico, 1994–2009","This dissertation demonstrates that Zapatista political identity functioned as an alternative mobilizing resource for the Chiapas rebellion in Mexico in the 15 years between 1994 and 2009. I argue that the EZLN (Zapatista Army of National Liberation) generated core themes of socioeconomic rights and socio-political justice from left-aligned, progressive Catholic and indigenous narratives associated with the Zapatista's diverse political identity. By developing a broad-based discourse in their declarations, communiqués and stories which united local concerns in Chiapas with global issues of neoliberal hegemony and indigenous rights, the rebellion resonated with many different kinds of actors and was able to stimulate innovative support networks locally and globally. The movement also developed in new ways via the substance of and interactions of these core narratives. This dissertation examines the rebellion in the context of the constitutive components of the Zapatista's diverse political identity. By observing the dynamics of identity and discourse in the Chiapas rebellion, this research demonstrates the significance of identity in social movement formation and mobilization, and has implications for the study of collective action and political identity formation more generally.",1033342358,,Dissertations & Theses," Seward, Ruhiya Kristine KathrynSewardKristine KathrynRuhiyaSeward, Ruhiya Kristine Kathryn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2735766821 , 67710822 , 66569 , 9781267487674 , 3518018 , 3518018", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267487674, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1033342358?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," Latin American Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Chiapas , Mexico , Political identity , Social movements , Zapatista",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fusing+Identities+and+Mobilizing+Resistance+in+Chiapas+and%0AMexico%2C+1994%E2%80%932009&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Seward%2C+Ruhiya+Kristine+Kathryn&amp;isbn=9781267487674&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Re/Moving care: Making care accessible through the Ontario Direct Funding program,"Through exploring current conceptualizations of 'care' in the Ontario Direct Funding program, I enter into conversations among disability scholars and activists who reject care as oppressive, and feminist care researchers who highlight care as a gendered form of work and an alternative moral framework. 'Direct funding' refers to disabled people or representative organizations receiving public funds in order to hire individuals to assist with daily needs. Direct funding is advocated for by Independent Living movements for the associated flexibility and increased user-control. The Ontario example fits within a number of contextual trends while it is uniquely administered by the Centre for Independent Living in Toronto. Drawing on insights from feminist disability studies and the feminist political ethic of care, I propose the conceptual framework of accessible care founded on a critical engagement with 'accessibility' and understanding care as a tension among competing definitions, including care as a form of oppression. Accessible care bridges: experience and theory; feminist and disability literatures; divides within disability communities; and the local and transnational. I employed a self-reflexive, interdisciplinary methodology to conduct 54 qualitative interviews with self-managers, attendants, informal supports, and key informants as well as a discourse analysis of written material. My approach includes access to insider perspectives from personal involvement with disability organizations, pre-established relationships with some of the participants, and a relational stance on analysis. The material reveals a process whereby care is removed from Direct Funding, but it is not eliminated. Rather, it is moved and transformed into arenas where it is deemed ""authentic"" and appropriate. This process alters the theoretical debates between feminist and disability scholars, as it is no longer about independence versus interdependence. The re/moving care process also influences a variety of policy issues as it obscures program limitations and the availability of services, conveys a nuanced message that short circuits discussions about worker regulation and health/social distinctions, and diverges from developments around intellectual disability. The Direct Funding program, and the re/moving care process it represents, suggest that Independent Living organizations and movements may have difficulty incorporating emerging intersectional, cultural approaches to disability represented by youth leadership.",1034189812,,Dissertations & Theses," Kelly, ChristineKellyChristineKelly, Christine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2738945051 , 71240172 , 66569 , 9780494877418 , NR87741 , NR87741", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780494877418, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1034189812?accountid=14496," 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies"," 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies"," 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies",," 0630 Public policy , 0733 Gender studies"," Public policy , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Care accessibility , Direct Funding , Disability , Ontario",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Re%2FMoving+care%3A+Making+care+accessible+through+the%0AOntario+Direct+Funding+program&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kelly%2C+Christine&amp;isbn=9780494877418&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Symbol of Modernity: Ghana, African Americans, and the Eisenhower Administration","Throughout the 1950s African Americans believed the decolonizing nation of Ghana gave the world a potent symbol of black ability to wield power fairly, peacefully, and effectively in modern political, economic, and social systems. Black Americans therefore attempted to use Ghana as a symbol of black modernity in the civil rights movement to convince American whites they should abandon the racist assumption that racial and social chaos would erupt upon the granting of full black civil rights. Such transnational racial identifications with Ghana also led numerous African American intellectuals, journalists, leaders, and organizations to pressure, often successfully, the administration of President Dwight D. Eisenhower to accord more attention and importance to Ghana, and to its leader Kwame Nkrumah. Among other events in the U.S.-Ghanaian relationship during the 1950s, African Americans played a role in causing Nkrumah's 1951 and 1958 visits to the United States and Vice President Richard Nixon's trip to the March 1957 independence ceremonies in Accra. Over the course of the decade African Americans also played a role in shifting American foreign policy in Africa toward at least a balance between European desires and African aspirations. Eisenhower and his Secretary of State John Foster Dulles largely left policy development on Africa to assistant secretaries of state and desk officers until the very end of the decade. African American leaders were constantly in contact with these mid-level officials, who often took black American views into account when thinking about the American approach to Africa. Exploring both the specific symbol of black ability to embrace modernity that African Americans saw in Ghana and African American influence on American foreign policy toward Africa during the 1950s reveals one of the ways race produced positive outcomes in the globalizing Cold War.",1034564842,,Dissertations & Theses," Grimm, Kevin E.GrimmE.KevinGrimm, Kevin E.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2741672111 , 71294912 , 66569 , 9781267519108 , 3519216 , 3519216", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267519108, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1034564842?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0331 African history , 0337 American history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0331 African history , 0337 American history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0331 African history , 0337 American history",," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0331 African history , 0337 American history"," African American Studies , Black studies , African history , American history"," Social sciences , African-American , Civil rights , Eisenhower, Dwight D. , Ghana , Nkrumah, Kwame , U.S. foreign policy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Symbol+of+Modernity%3A+Ghana%2C+African+Americans%2C+and+the+Eisenhower+Administration&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grimm%2C+Kevin+E.&amp;isbn=9781267519108&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Reading race: Postcolonial nationalism in Korea,"This dissertation focuses on the significance of race to South Korean postcolonial nationalism. Despite critical scholarly attention paid to nationalist narratives in contemporary South Korea, the centrality of race remains peripheral. This poverty of investigation is paradoxical given the centrality of myths of racial origin, purity and uniqueness to nationalist historiography, political movements and discourses of the everyday. More intriguing still are the ways in which the modern myth of Korean racial homogeneity oppresses foreign 'others', particularly following the advent of Korea's state-sponsored globalization movement. This project addresses the near absence of critical work concerned with the development of modern racial consciousness in Korea. My dissertation investigates different sites of transnational and trans-cultural encounter between Koreans and non-Koreans that generate racial anxiety in the form of civil unrest, policy conundrums and new social phenomena. The emergence of multicultural politics to manage the political controversies concerning the presence of migrant workers and brides; the changing socio-legal status of biracial peoples; and the racial aesthetics of Korea's popular culture industry as embodied in the Hallyu (""Korea Wave"") phenomenon, feature as sites of examination. The case studies of this project operate upon the premise that how South Korea currently confronts the processes and demands of neoliberal globalization reflects a great deal about the centrality of race to post-colonial, national identity, as well as how it is currently under duress and transformation. This dissertation contributes to Korean studies scholarship on postcolonial race relations, which is relatively small and emergent.

Professional Networks, HIV/AIDS, and the Politics of Universal Health Care","The neoliberal logic that gained ascendancy in the 1980s emphasized privatization of government services, the weakening of social entitlements, and the liberalization of government regulation. The broadening of state obligations in a costly area like healthcare would therefore seem to run counter to this logic. And yet, contrary to the dominant neoliberal ideological climate, the late 1980s witnessed the beginning of a surprising shift towards more expansive state commitments to healthcare in the developing world. This dissertation explores the expansion of state commitments to healthcare in the developing world, grounded in in-depth case studies of three newly industrializing countries—Thailand, Brazil, and South Africa. Through the 1980s, low-cost programs aimed at health promotion and disease prevention dominated state efforts, revolving around what is often called ""primary healthcare."" But in the 1990s – coinciding with a formidable new public health threat in the form of the HIV/AIDS epidemic – a number of developing countries began to embrace approaches to healthcare provision that emphasized universal coverage with access to comprehensive care and advanced medical technology. This research explores the relationship between the state, political parties, the medical profession, illness-based social movements, and international actors in three major industrializing countries engaged in processes of democratic deepening. In the context of neoliberalism and a growing role for foreign philanthropy in efforts to address an emerging epidemic, this study gives particular attention to understanding what role the private sector and international actors have played in helping to shape these shifting norms. Through comparative historical analysis, this research seeks to understand variation in the social and political dynamics that prompted newly industrializing states to redefine their obligations to citizens' healthcare.",1038154207,,Dissertations & Theses," Harris, JosephHarrisJosephHarris, Joseph",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2753749021 , 70347472 , 66569 , 9781267562418 , 3523339 , 3523339", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267562418, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1038154207?accountid=14496," 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy",," 0573 Public health , 0617 Public administration , 0630 Public policy"," Public health , Public administration , Public policy"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Activist , Brazil , HIV/AIDS , Health care , Public health , South Africa , State , Thailand , Universal coverage",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Right+to+Health%3F+Professional+Networks%2C+HIV%2FAIDS%2C+and+the+Politics+of+Universal+Health+Care&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Harris%2C+Joseph&amp;isbn=9781267562418&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Passages to (Be) Longing: Contemporary Black Novels of Diaspora and Dislocation,"""Passages to (Be)Longing"" looks at contemporary novels of the anglophone African diaspora through the lens of movement, migration, and dislocation, with particular attention to how the selected authors depict black diasporic identity formation, and how they contribute to it through their writings. Thematically, this dissertation examines literary representations of the social, cultural, and psychological consequences that involuntary and voluntary migrations have had for black communities and individuals in North America, the Caribbean, and Britain. Methodologically, it operates at the interface of literary studies, black/Africana studies, diaspora studies, and Atlantic studies. It explores the juncture of history, memory, geography, and diasporic identity, as represented by eight contemporary novelists of African and African-Caribbean descent: Charles Johnson ( Middle Passage ), Lawrence Hill ( The Book of Negroes ), Toni Morrison ( Sula and Tar Baby ), George Lamming ( The Emigrants ), Caryl Phillips ( The Final Passage, A State of Independence, and Crossing the River ), Andrea Levy ( Small Island ), Cecil Foster ( Sleep on, Beloved ), and Edwidge Danticat ( Breath, Eyes, Memory ). Three interrelated arguments inform this study. First, I posit that my selected novelists actively contribute to the ongoing transnational formation of black diasporic identities. Second, I propose that much can be gained by applying a dually focused thematic approach that both examines these novelists' representations of ""diaspora"" and explores their depictions of the more loosely and temporarily understood experience of ""dislocation"" because, in these authors' treatment, the diasporic longing to belong manifests itself in stories of various types of black displacement. Third, the novels analyzed here reflect what I term, referencing W.E.B. Du Bois's intellectual and terminological legacy (and Paul Gilroy's and Samir Dayal's dialogues with it) a ""diasporic double consciousness."" That is, my selected novelists on the one hand portray the possibility of belonging as if it were, in itself, a fiction for their protagonists. On the other hand, they depict their geographically re-routed characters' desire to have a framework of identification transcending temporary, fleeting social roles as a fundamental human need that cannot be suppressed without incurring psychological damage. Any shared dynamics characterizing the diverse body of contemporary black anglophone diasporic literature coalesce around this duality. Chapter 1 discusses Johnson's fictional account of the Middle Passage, the foundational in-transit experience of black diasporic history; chapter 2, Hill's creation of a late-eighteenth-century diasporic individual who, during her long and adventurous life, inhabits various locations on the Atlantic rim; chapter 3, Morrison's and Phillips's linkages of war, citizenship, African American troops/veterans, and diaspora; chapter 4, Lamming's, Phillips's, and Levy's novels about black Caribbean immigrants' lives in Britain after World War II; and chapter 5, Phillips's, Foster's, and Danticat's depictions of contemporary black Caribbean encounters with the United States and Canada, with a particular emphasis on the complexities of ""return."" My discussion proceeds chronologically, in terms of the eras that the authors portray, and is also organized around national and continental categories relevant to Atlantic scholarship. At the same time, my study recognizes the limitations of such categories and points beyond them towards what Gilroy in Against Race terms ""planetary humanism"" a transnational approach that, within the Gilroyan paradigm, draws much of its interpretive potential from the concept of diaspora.",1038184332,,Dissertations & Theses," Valkeakari, Tuire MarittaValkeakariMarittaTuireValkeakari, Tuire Maritta",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2754079391 , 71535642 , 66569 , 9781267575098 , 3525219 , 3525219", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267575098, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1038184332?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0325 Black studies , 0352 Canadian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0325 Black studies , 0352 Canadian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," 0298 Modern literature , 0325 Black studies , 0352 Canadian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature",," 0298 Modern literature , 0325 Black studies , 0352 Canadian literature , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," Modern literature , Black studies , Canadian literature , Caribbean literature , American literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Africa , African diaspora , Black anglophone novel , Diaspora , Diasporic identity , Middle Passage , Migration , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Passages+to+%28Be%29+Longing%3A+Contemporary+Black+Novels+of+Diaspora+and+Dislocation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Valkeakari%2C+Tuire+Maritta&amp;isbn=9781267575098&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Political Economy of Migration in China,"Since opening up its economy to international trade and investment in the 1970s, China has undergone the largest transfer of rural populations to urban eras in modern history. In order to achieve these growth levels, massive migration was necessary in order to provide the armies of cheap labor that has been China's comparative economic advantage and the very core of its economic development strategy. This thesis examines the history of, and tensions within, China migration policy, and its implication for China's long-term position in the global economy. This thesis argues that China's migration policy is attempting to reconcile two conflicting goals of the ruling elite. On the one hand, migration flows are necessary to fulfill China's export-oriented industrial strategy, which requires vast amounts of cheap labor. On the other hand, the freedom of movement which migration requires poses a potential threat to social and political instability, especially if it sets the stage for independent civic mobilizations over the longer term. Maintaining the Hukou registration system as a form of residual control also encourages the existence of a large underclass of low wage workers who possess minimal rights in the areas to which they have migrated. The resulting income inequalities are themselves a source of social discontent that may well threaten the legitimacy of Communist governance.",1038375494,,Dissertations & Theses," Yang, YutongYangYutongYang, Yutong",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2754759871 , 69403612 , 66569 , 9781267562982 , 1516784 , 1516784", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267562982, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1038375494?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0615 Political science , 0700 Social structure"," Asian Studies , Political science , Social structure"," Social sciences , Hukou , Migration , Public policy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Political+Economy+of+Migration+in+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yang%2C+Yutong&amp;isbn=9781267562982&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""Invisible margin"": Marginalization and activism of Adivasi women in researches in Bangladesh","In the context of historical marginalization of indigenous people from diverse ethnic communities in Bangladesh, this study will investigate how mainstream researches and writings, in books, research reports, newspapers, and blogs on indigenous issues have ignored women's relegation by homogenizing women's distinctive problems with communities' marginalization.

In the existing body of research, immigrants are typically found to form HTAs to participate in transnational in order to wage the economic and political clout they garnered in the US within their communities of origin. In this dissertation, I focus on an under-studied organizational form: solidary immigrant HTAs. As leaders of a solidary organization, founders of the Club Atenas formed the association in order to fulfill the community's underlying social and affective desires. Since club members were neither economically nor politically motivated, the club is a unique case for understanding the role leaders play in the formation and disbandment of HTAs. Specifically, leaders were critically important for mobilizing and renewing community members' constantly diminishing motivation to participate in the emergent organization, a phenomenon which is typically not the case in HTAs discussed in existing research. The dissertation reports data collected from a case study conducted in the south suburbs of Chicago within the community of immigrants from Atenas, a middle-sized city in a central state in Mexico. Data include ethnographic observations conducted over five years of HTA meetings and events (of which two the club was in a state of abeyance) and 45 interviews with Atenenses involved in the club at various capacities (e.g., leaders and board members). Based on these data, I find that the solidary foundation of the HTA made its survival less vulnerable to changes in the political and economic environment, and more dependent on leader-follower dynamics. Specifically, the club's emergence is explained by organizational leaders' ability to overcome motivational entropy – the tendency for the motivation to participate in organizational activities to fall over time (Chapter 2). Additionally, members' enthusiasm for participating in the club weakened over time because leaders failed to respond to the diminishing emotional returns members reaped from engaging in club activities (Chapter 3) and as a result of leaders' inability to mitigate the pressure other immigrant and Mexican organizations exerted on the club's resources (Chapter 4); this diminishing motivation eventually led to the decline of the club. This dissertation improves our understanding of the factors that explain the emergence and survival of these important immigrant organizations by offering a set of social mechanisms that explain the emergence and disbandment of hometown associations, in particular, and of other community-based and voluntary organizations, in general. The mechanisms described throughout the dissertation offer plausible social processes that explain why solidary organizations and movements emerge and fail. Additionally, the dissertation identifies a unique immigrant organizational form vis-à-vis existing research: HTAs that are formed for neither political nor economic gain. As such, the organization's emergence and survival was not influenced by global political and economic forces, but rather by leaders' ability to negotiate the affective needs of club participants while carefully addressing the organizational challenges arising from supra-organizational factors.",1040726334,,Dissertations & Theses," Santana, RafaelSantanaRafaelSantana, Rafael",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2763063391 , 71892352 , 66569 , 9781267602268 , 3526353 , 3526353", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267602268, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1040726334?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Social structure , Organizational behavior , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Atenas , Case study , Chicago , Community leaders , Hometown associations , Illinois , Mexican immigrants , Mexico , Organizational life cycles , Social mechanisms",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+life+and+death+of+hometown+associations&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Santana%2C+Rafael&amp;isbn=9781267602268&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"European fascists and local activists: Romania's Legion of the Archangel Michael (1922–1938),"In interwar Europe, “fascism” referred to a diffuse collection of independent movements and regimes that used similar symbols, gestures, and activities to pioneer a distinctive style of politics. The Legion of the Archangel Michael, also known as the Iron Guard, was one of the largest fascist social movements in interwar Europe. This dissertation examines how rank and file Legionaries experienced and articulated their political affiliations as members of the Legion, and more broadly as part of a global fascist network. Official repression, fascist aesthetics, and the demands of Legionary activism meant that becoming a Legionary involved far more than giving intellectual assent to a clearly articulated set of ideas. It changed activists’ everyday activities and life trajectories in profound ways. From the late nineteenth century onwards, Romanian ultra-nationalists organized to eliminate Jews, Freemasons, Communists, and political corruption from their society. Anti-Semitic violence increased in the universities in 1922, and extremist students engaged in mob violence, vandalism, and assassination. Ultra-nationalist activists built connections with racists abroad, but they based their movement on ways of thinking about Jews and Romanians that derived from nineteenth century nationalism. In 1927 Corneliu Zelea Codreanu and a small group followers split with other ultra-nationalists to form the Legion of the Archangel Michael. Legionaries gradually took over the anti-Semitic student movement by using a combination of violence, terrorism, and pious rhetoric. Elections were usually violent affairs for Legionaries, who flouted the law but also ran work camps, restaurants, and businesses. Legionaries described the Legion as a school for creating “new men” who would bring about national rebirth. Creating “new men” meant belonging to a hierarchical organization that expected total obedience from its members. Legionaries committed time, money and energy to expanding their movement and risked imprisonment and even death in return. They spoke about continuing the national struggle of their ancestors, but used uniforms, gestures, and symbols that identified them as part of a Europe-wide fascist current.",1048228009,,Dissertations & Theses," Clark, RolandClarkRolandClark, Roland",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2767653401 , 72057632 , 66569 , 9781267660367 , 3529484 , 3529484", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267660367, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1048228009?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies , 0582 Modern history",," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies , 0582 Modern history"," European history , East European Studies , Modern history"," Social sciences , Activists , Alltagsgeschichte , Codreanu, Corneliu Zelea , Fascism , Iron Guard , Legion of the Archangel Michael , Romania",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=European+fascists+and+local+activists%3A+Romania%27s+Legion+of+the+Archangel+Michael+%281922%E2%80%931938%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clark%2C+Roland&amp;isbn=9781267660367&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Empowering Small Farmers in India through Organic Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation,"""Empowering Small Farmers in India through Organic Agriculture and Biodiversity Conservation"" investigates how, through conversion to organic agriculture, with its postulated socioeconomic, environmental and health benefits, and through biodiversity conservation, by, for example, creating community seed banks, local farming organizations enable and empower small farmers to become independent and self-sufficient. Local farming organizations are defined as movements to improve the economic, health, and social status of independent farmers in the face of global agribusiness through the adoption of sustainable agriculture. I explore the philosophy of these organizations; the agricultural and political ideas they transmit; the challenges they face in involving small farmers; and how farmers who become involved assess this experience. Fieldwork for this study was carried out during 2007 and 2008 in the Indian states of Punjab, Uttarakhand, Tamil Nadu, and West Bengal. Living in villages in these states—approximately three months per state—I completed 89 in-depth and 16 focus group interviews with female and male farmers, and with the farming organizations' staff, for a total of 250 participants. Interviews and field observations, primarily those carried out in Punjab and Uttarakhand, constitute the data for this dissertation. I found that farmers who get involved with these organizations do perceive that their food security is improved through conservation and the revival of traditional crops. Additionally their economic situation is strengthened with less expenditure on inputs such as seed, chemical pesticides, or mineral fertilizers. Finally, it is argued, training provided by these organizations prepares farmers, many of whom become more self-reliant and confident individuals, to stand up for their democratic rights in the midst of the formidable power of globalized corporate agriculture. This study contributes to a growing understanding among small farmers, researchers and international human rights and farming-focused organizations (e.g., the United Nations Human Rights Council and the Food and Agriculture Organization), of how reinvestment in sustainable agriculture is vital to the realization of the right to food, and to rural economic development, issues that were accentuated by the 2008 global food price crisis and current return to a pattern of rising food prices that are reaching 2008 levels.",1086330909,,Dissertations & Theses," Nicolaysen, Anna MarieNicolaysenMarieAnnaNicolaysen, Anna Marie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2779765881 , 71109212 , 66569 , 9781267659125 , 3529365 , 3529365", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267659125, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1086330909?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0438 Environmental economics , 0473 Agriculture , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0438 Environmental economics , 0473 Agriculture , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0438 Environmental economics , 0473 Agriculture , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0640 Sustainability",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0438 Environmental economics , 0473 Agriculture , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," Cultural anthropology , Environmental economics , Agriculture , Environmental Studies , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Biodiversity conservation , Climate change adaptation , India , Organic agriculture , Right to food , Seed sovereignty , Small farmers , Sustainable agriculture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Empowering+Small+Farmers+in+India+through+Organic+Agriculture+and+Biodiversity+Conservation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nicolaysen%2C+Anna+Marie&amp;isbn=9781267659125&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Eve Ensler's “The Vagina Monologues” as feminist activist ecology,"Eve Ensler's The Vagina Monologues presents a means integrating discussion of the vagina into public discourse for the purpose of ending violence against women.

While the play has engaged the activist spirit of women in more than 140 countries, I call for more discourse on the racial and national tensions in the text. By putting the more recent script of the production beneath intersectional feminist and pedagogical lenses, I assert the importance of dialogical listening across social and geopolitical boundaries. I also argue for equitable representation of women both as individuals and in relation to one another, their immediate context, and the global sphere. I offer feminist modes of rhetoric and ethics as a point of entry for unpacking the privilege underpinning V-Day discourse—specifically the play's representations of colonialism and white First World privilege. Overall, I argue that V-Day activists can, and should, question what it means to practice feminism within the context of globalization, by integrating attention to ""nation"" into existing feminist readings.",1095401901,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, Rebecca ChristineLeeChristineRebeccaLee, Rebecca Christine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2783579431 , 73004022 , 66569 , 9781267635785 , 1519180 , 1519180", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267635785, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1095401901?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0465 Theater"," 0298 Modern literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0465 Theater"," 0298 Modern literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0465 Theater",," 0298 Modern literature , 0453 Womens studies , 0465 Theater"," Modern literature , Womens studies , Theater"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Activism , Ecology , Eve Ensler , Feminism , Intersectionality , Transnationality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Eve+Ensler%27s+%E2%80%9CThe+Vagina+Monologues%E2%80%9D+as+feminist%0Aactivist+ecology&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Rebecca+Christine&amp;isbn=9781267635785&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A history of Black women faculty at Michigan State University, 1968 - 2009","This dissertation examines the careers of African American women faculty at Michigan State University from the 1960s through 2009.

Finally, I highlight the careers and intellectual women who broke through racial, sexual, and class barriers to become successful scholars in the academy. Black women faculty members worked towards equality of opportunity and social justice accomplishments of African Americans in and out of the classroom. They contributed to changing curriculum and created diverse approaches to learning about race, class, gender and the experiences of other ethnic groups. Outside of the walls of the ivory tower, a number of Black women professors participated in community building by working in social, civic and religious organizations. It is important to note that several scholars published books and essays that sought to assist the African American community on local, national and international levels. Some of the works include books on the African Diaspora by Ruth Simms Hamilton, African American Women's History by Darlene Clark Hine, African American Language by Geneva Smitherman, the Black Family by Harriette Pipes McAdoo, Children's Literacy by Patricia Edwards and Religion by Jualynne Dodson. The data used for this study include: essays of Black female faculty; Affirmative Action Records; Board of Trustees Minutes; examination of Almanacs of the Chronicle of Higher Education; Association of Academic University Professors (AAUP) documents and reports; examination of local and regional newspapers - Lansing State Journal, The State News, The Michigan Chronicle, and Detroit Free Press; unpublished writings, and other relevant historical materials relating to the MSU community during the 1960s to 2009. This dissertation illuminates some of the concerns, challenges as well as barriers broken down by MSU's Black women faculty. Implications for future research suggest that Michigan States' climate, race relations, and the institutionalized mentoring of junior scholars must improve in order to increase retention of Black women faculty. This historical study of the life stories and professional experiences of Black female faculty may inspire other scholars of marginalized groups, institution leaders, and students to take note and devise measures that will ensure their survival, retention, and success within the academy.",1115148919,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith, Marshanda Ann LatriceSmithAnn LatriceMarshandaSmith, Marshanda Ann Latrice",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2798419631 , 73343862 , 66569 , 9781267682277 , 3541685 , 3541685", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267682277, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1115148919?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0453 Womens studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0453 Womens studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0453 Womens studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0328 Black history , 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0453 Womens studies"," African American Studies , Black studies , Black history , Higher Education Administration , Womens studies"," Social sciences , Education , African-American , Black women's history , Michigan State University , Women faculty",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+history+of+Black+women+faculty+at+Michigan+State+University%2C+1968+-+2009&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+Marshanda+Ann+Latrice&amp;isbn=9781267682277&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Sustainable rural development through alternative economic networks: Redefining relations in the commodity chain for export vegetables in western Guatemala,"The current research considers the capacity of a local organic food system for producer and consumer empowerment and sustainable development outcomes in western Guatemala. Many have argued that the forging of local agricultural networks linking farmers, consumers, and supporting institutions is an effective tool for challenging the negative economic, environmental, and sociopolitical impacts associated with industrial models of global food production. But does this work in the context of agrarian development in the developing world? Despite the fact that there is extensive literature concerning local food system formation in the global north, there remains a paucity of research covering how the principles of local food systems are being integrated into agricultural development projects in developing countries. My work critically examines claims to agricultural sustainability and actor empowerment in a local organic food system built around non-traditional agricultural crops in western Guatemala. Employing a mixed methods research design involving twenty months of participant observation, in-depth interviewing, surveying, and a self-administered questionnaire, the project evaluates the sustainability of this NGO-led development initiative and local food movement along several dimensions. Focusing on the unique economic and social networks of actors and institutions at each stage of the commodity chain, this research shows how the growth of an alternative food system continues to be shaped by context specific processes, politics, and structures of conventional food systems. Further, it shows how the specifics of context also produce new relationships of cooperation and power in the development process. Results indicate that structures surrounding agrarian development in the Guatemalan context give rise to a hybrid form of development that at the same time contests and reinforces conventional models of food production and consumption. Therefore, participation entails a host of compromises and tradeoffs that result in mixed successes and setbacks, as actors attempt to refashion conventional commodity chains through local food system formation.",1115148930,,Dissertations & Theses," Klotz, Ryan J.KlotzJ.RyanKlotz, Ryan J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2798409071 , 73343542 , 66569 , 9781267685704 , 3541798 , 3541798", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267685704, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1115148930?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0503 Agricultural economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability , 0700 Social structure"," Cultural anthropology , Agricultural economics , Latin American Studies , Public policy , Sustainability , Social structure"," Social sciences , Agroecology , Alternative food network , Alternative networks , Guatemala , Organic agriculture , Rural development , Sustainability",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sustainable+rural+development+through+alternative+economic+networks%3A+Redefining+relations+in+the+commodity+chain+for+export+vegetables+in+western+Guatemala&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Klotz%2C+Ryan+J.&amp;isbn=9781267685704&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Capacity Building for Citizenship Education: Global Hegemony and the New ""Ethics of Civilization""","The concept of capacity building has seen a swell of support in recent years. Many, varying from community-based practitioners to multinational institutions, have leveraged the concept in their work. By investigating the ethics (the normative positions), the explanations (the explanatory positions), and what evidence people use to measure capacity (the empirical positions), this research uses a Critical Discourse Analysis to investigate the relationships that are formed by employing capacity building for citizenship education. After investigating multinational policy documents and interviewing participants in Jamaica and Canada, I argue that capacity building for citizenship education has vastly disparate and contrasting manifestations. While Capacity Building is widely understood as an effort to emphasize local agency, it becomes quickly evident that the nature of that agency is often circumscribed by dominant institutions of the global market economy. Take, for example, the World Bank, which propagates crippling structural adjustment policies in Jamaica, but at the same time is also one of the most active policy makers in the field of capacity building. There are, however, many voices that appear through the interviews that are critical of this process. These voices question the ability, and appropriateness, of capacity building when used by many policy makers, and the resulting intervention into people’s lives. This disparate condition of capacity building has been brought about by the articulation of three conjoined processes: The first—my critique of the explanatory position—is that the emphasis on the capacity for action unrealistically privileges agency at the expense of our understanding of social structures; the second—my empirical argument of the nature of capacity building—is that the movement has become intertwined with global political economic discourses thereby providing the “spirit” of global capital; the third—my critique of the normative position—is that capacity building has attempted to provide an ethical project which stresses incorporation, as opposed to exclusion, as a form of hegemony. When these three positions are read together, I argue that capacity building has provided a complex policy matrix in forming the hegemonic relationship of global capital; what is referred to here as the new ethics of civilization.",1151830251,,Dissertations & Theses," McGray, Robert G.McGrayG.RobertMcGray, Robert G.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2815330271 , 73695892 , 66569 , 9780494893753 , NR89375 , NR89375", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780494893753, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1151830251?accountid=14496, 0534 Social studies education, 0534 Social studies education, 0534 Social studies education,, 0534 Social studies education, Social studies education," Education , Citizenship education , Ethics of Civilization , Global hegemony",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Capacity+Building+for+Citizenship+Education%3A+Global+Hegemony+and+the+New+%22Ethics+of+Civilization%22&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McGray%2C+Robert+G.&amp;isbn=9780494893753&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""‘Beauty on Bond Street’: Gender, enterprise, and the establishment of an English beauty industry, 1850–1910","In the mid-nineteenth century, London's beauty industry consisted of modest small-scale firms clustered in discrete metropolitan spaces under constant threat of social censure. By 1910, many of these same firms had expanded into multinational, capital-intensive corporations serving a mass market of global consumers. ""'Beauty on Bond Street': gender, enterprise, and the establishment of an English beauty industry, 1850-1910"" charts this transformation, revealing how material developments converged with cultural discourses to reshape Victorian beauty culture, from one that demanded the concealment of artificial bodily manipulation into one that tolerated and sanctioned women's overt beauty consumption. It does so by tracking the role of male and female tradesmen, including hairdressers and barbers, wigmakers, manufacturing perfumers, and complexion specialists, who developed a vibrant commercial industry for male and female customers and became implicated in a surprising set of conflicts and alliances. ""Beauty on Bond Street"" anchors the history of the beauty industry in specific urban spaces, presenting a spatial story about Victorian London and the dynamic relationship between commercial ventures and the urban spaces in which they were located. As a social history, it tracks the demographic profile of discrete London spaces and the material practices and social networks of its local merchants. It juxtaposes elite Mayfair retailers against less affluent proprietors in the neighboring ""backmews"" of St. James's and Soho. Moving eastward from the ""court"" end of town, it explores the East End's penny barbershops that were hubs of foreign and working-class sociability. It tracks the movements of one émigré perfumer, Eugène Rimmel, whose relocation from Soho's Francophone networks to the Strand marked his establishment of ""cosmopolitan"" authority. Moving beyond the boundaries of the nation, it reveals how London-based merchants participated in the cultural politics of empire through the transmission of an English beauty aesthetic that was natural, unblemished, and white. ""Beauty on Bond Street"" exploits a wide range of sources, from trade directories and records of individual firms, to print media debates over cosmetic adornment, to census data on neighborhood demographics. It cuts across conventional subdivisions in history to explore the urban commercial environment, business history, household production, state and moral regulation, and the imperial metropolitan implications of Britain's beauty culture.",1152159432,,Dissertations & Theses," Clark, Jessica P.ClarkP.JessicaClark, Jessica P.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2817078371 , 73732632 , 66569 , 9781267752178 , 3532382 , 3532382", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267752178, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1152159432?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history,, 0335 European history, European history," Social sciences , Beauty industry , Consumption , England , Female enterprise , Gender , Labor and service , London - 19th century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%E2%80%98Beauty+on+Bond+Street%E2%80%99%3A+Gender%2C+enterprise%2C+and+the+establishment+of+an+English+beauty+industry%2C+1850%E2%80%931910&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clark%2C+Jessica+P.&amp;isbn=9781267752178&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"White diamond: Elizabeth Taylor's adventures in American empire and the ecstasy of postcolonial whiteness,"This dissertation examines the iconicity of movie star Elizabeth Taylor and theorizes that the amalgam of her onscreen and off-screen images forms a textual body that serves as a metaphor for American Empire at the apex of its power and allows Taylor to become an exemplar of postcolonial whiteness, a social and political formation which she reveals is reified through the performance of a global citizenship that is characterized by encumbered transnational mobility and noblesse oblige. This work closely investigates Taylor's various iterations during her seventy years of unprecedented fame: her turn as the plantation mistress in a cycle of films in the 1950s who helps recuperate the colonial past as the U.S. emerges as the world's greatest military power, her transformation as the ecstatic globetrotting oriental in whiteface whom Taylor constructs in part through her evasions of blackness in the 1960 and 1970s, and finally onto her work as the stalwart AIDS activist during the sexually repressive and politically conservative Reagan 1980s. In these various guises the star shows an anxious and captivated audience fearing the loss of white power after the official death of empire and the rise of black liberation movements that postcoloniality actually promises whites a carte blanche to experience a modernity based on an imperative of personal liberation, pleasure, and political agency without the burdens of race. Interpreting archival materials pertaining to Taylor in the Margaret Herrick Library and the Warner Bros. Archives and using work from critical race theory, postcolonial theory, gender studies, film theory and political theory including the notion of the possessive individual for whom American citizenship was invented to protect the white subject's rights to freedom and accumulation, this work maps how Elizabeth Taylor is the singular figure who best simultaneously glamorizes capitalism and romanticizes imperialism. Through her performance of exceptional whiteness in the numerous media including Hollywood films and countless photographs which frame her image as both excessively glamorous and strangely beautiful, Taylor's signification as an unapologetic imperial figure is used to argue that whites are indeed deserving of the exclusive privileges guaranteed by racialized juridical citizenship.",1152180737,,Dissertations & Theses," Shin, GloriaShinGloriaShin, Gloria",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2817156931 , 70547562 , 66569 , 9781267701855 , 3542476 , 3542476", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267701855, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1152180737?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0323 American studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0304 Biographies , 0323 American studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0304 Biographies , 0323 American studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0304 Biographies , 0323 American studies , 0900 Film studies"," Biographies , American studies , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , American Empire , Hollywood cinema , Postcolonialism , Race , Stardom , Taylor, Elizabeth",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=White+diamond%3A+Elizabeth+Taylor%27s+adventures+in+American+empire+and+the+ecstasy+of+postcolonial+whiteness&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shin%2C+Gloria&amp;isbn=9781267701855&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Superarchitecture: Experimental Architectural Practices in Italy 1963–1973,"This dissertation considers 'Superarchitecture,' a term that has variously been used by scholars to refer to a wide range of architectural experimentation that took place across Italy between 1963 and 1973. The ""Superarchitettura"" exhibitions, staged in Pistoia and Modena between 1966 and 1967, opened a progression of seismic shifts in Italian architecture. In them, Archizoom and Superstudio showcased new prototypes for furniture and consumer products. This dissertation examines the transformation of these early products into a spectrum of design tactics, designed objects, and critical languages. The geographical locations that produced these experiments—Florence and Turin— provide the framework for this study. Section 1 examines the chief collectives that developed a Florentine milieu active through the early seventies. Umberto Eco framed their work in Appunti per una semiologia delle comunicazioni visive , a pamphlet that accompanied the course that he taught at the Faculty of Architecture at the University of Florence. While others, such as Ettore Sottsass and Alessandro Mendini developed much of the design, production, and marketing strategies that came to characterize Superarchitecture, it was Eco who joined architecture to a structuralist position derived from Roland Barthes, to first expand Modernist understanding of function and fuel Florentine antidesign agitators. Archizoom provides a particularly productive site for exploring the development of Superarchitecture's political culture. Section 2 narrates Archizoom's dynamic ideology by examining Claudio Greppi's political linkages and input to the group, as well as the movement's ideological expressions in specialized architectural periodicals such as Casabella , Design Quarterly , and In . Simultaneously, Giorgio Ceretti, Pietro Derossi, Riccardo Rosso, and others examined similar issues in Turin. Critical of their particular social and political environments, the Turinese architects radicalized their disciplinary milieus and broadened the movement's initial scope by borrowing in equal parts from Olivetti's latest advances in automated fabrication, an international cast of visiting experimentalists that included Archigram, and the tumultuous Turin of 1969.",1163815007,,Dissertations & Theses," Wolf, AmitWolfAmitWolf, Amit",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2818092701 , 68351072 , 66569 , 9781267753472 , 3532446 , 3532446", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267753472, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1163815007?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0389 Design , 0729 Architecture"," 0377 Art history , 0389 Design , 0729 Architecture"," 0377 Art history , 0389 Design , 0729 Architecture",," 0377 Art history , 0389 Design , 0729 Architecture"," Art history , Design , Architecture"," Communication and the arts , Architecture , Architettura Radicale , Archizoom , Branzi, Andrea , Derossi, Pietro , Eco, Umberto , Italy , Semiology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Superarchitecture%3A+Experimental+Architectural+Practices+in+Italy+1963%E2%80%931973&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wolf%2C+Amit&amp;isbn=9781267753472&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Persecution and Permanence: Re-Negotiating Brazil's Identity, Religious Intolerance, and Consuming Candomblé","Over the last 10 years, religiously fueled conflicts have been on overdrive. The new wave of Pentecostalism in Bahia, Brazil is gaining strength. The Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus stands as a religious behemoth in the city center of Salvador. It is a golden palace displaying its clear economic might, political power and influence over public morale, surrounded by the mushrooming impoverished hillsides of the disempowered masses. In its effort to distinguish cosmologies in a world of religious syncretism and Catholic hegemony, the Evangelical Church depends on demonizing Candomblé, an African-Diasporic religion. Candomblé has had a long history of oppression and discrimination in Brazil and early scholarship surrounding Candomblé has always linked it to represent a traditional Afro-Brazilian identity. However, Candomblé no longer represents nostalgia to the colonial past but rather an alternative modernity. This paper explores the effects of demonization of Candomblé in Salvador, Bahia Brazil by analyzing the current interactions between state/govt. agencies, the Evangelical movement, and the Candomblé community as they penetrate public morale, the booming tourist industry, and ultimately negotiate Brazil's new identity. Furthermore, as a result of this conflict, rising new alliances show that Candomblé is not a fragile religion in danger of extinction but has instead entered the playing field of global religions fighting for legitimacy, popularity and acceptance. Lastly, this research suggests that sustaining religiously fueled conflicts amongst the Afro-Brazilian community is ultimately a political tool that destabilizes progress towards a unified movement against similar structural social problems.",1237220470,,Dissertations & Theses," Stansky, VictoriaStanskyVictoriaStansky, Victoria",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2839293311 , 69226292 , 66569 , 9781267768551 , 1530110 , 1530110", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267768551, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1237220470?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0344 Social research , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0344 Social research , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0344 Social research , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Social research , Latin American Studies , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Candomble , Cultural cooptation , Neo-Pentecostalism , Racialized inequalities , Religious intolerance",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Persecution+and+Permanence%3A+Re-Negotiating+Brazil%27s+Identity%2C%0AReligious+Intolerance%2C+and+Consuming+Candombl%C3%A9&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stansky%2C+Victoria&amp;isbn=9781267768551&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Visions of a Peaceful World: Locating Peace in Early Nineteenth-Century New England, 1805–1850","Early nineteenth-century America witnessed a crusade to end all war and establish a peaceful culture. The energy behind the movement came from New England, not from mid-Atlantic Quakers. Made up of military veterans, liberal and conservative Christians, entrepreneurs and merchants, mothers and moralists, these reformers argued that all war, even the American Revolution, was contrary to Gospel ethics. I examine the lives and writings of four prominent peace advocates: Congregational minister Noah Worcester; Yankee entrepreneur and Presbyterian David Low Dodge; merchant, gentleman farmer, and orthodox Congregationalist convert William Ladd; and popular author and Episcopalian Lydia Huntley Sigourney. Drawing on their experiences with personal and local conflicts, they developed alternative pathways to peace, thereby emphasizing a variety of methods and outcomes. Dodge shunned government and renounced all forms of violence (even in self-defense). Worcester and Ladd placed their hope in government—local, state, national, and international. Sigourney argued that peace depended on the education of women who would teach young men how to live in harmony. Despite their differences, all four argued that wars and violence were not natural but personal and collective choices. Peace was not merely the absence of violence or war. It was the creation and maintenance of social hierarchies and cultural systems at the local level—in families, churches, towns, and reform organizations—that promoted nonviolent conflict resolution. Previous studies of peace activism often present early reformers as participants in an unbroken chain of ""pacifists."" While it may be tempting to emphasize parallels between future pacifists and early peace advocates, we can comprehend activists' motivations and appreciate their diverse visions only by understanding their social and political milieus. Using a biographical lens, I analyze the interplay between personal experiences and ideological formation, explore the array of strategies offered by the leading peace advocates, and identify new contexts in which to understand peace advocacy, reform, and abolition. Conflicts and developments in early nineteenth-century New England—such as the Unitarian controversy, the decline of the Federalist Party, the remaking of gender norms, and the growth of benevolent institutions—are key to understanding the leading reformers' inspirations and ideology.",1237999040,,Dissertations & Theses," Blythe, Patrick G.BlytheG.PatrickBlythe, Patrick G.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2840561601 , 71227352 , 66569 , 9781267795526 , 3533972 , 3533972", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267795526, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1237999040?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0563 Peace Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0563 Peace Studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0563 Peace Studies"," Religious history , American history , Peace Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , American Peace Society , Antebellum , Early Republic , New England , Peace movements , Social reform",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Visions+of+a+Peaceful+World%3A+Locating+Peace+in+Early+Nineteenth-Century+New+England%2C+1805%E2%80%931850&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blythe%2C+Patrick+G.&amp;isbn=9781267795526&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Anglo-Catholic revival's contribution to the resurgence of the Venetian enamel mosaic industry,"The art of mosaic decoration has existed for millennia. The earliest examples are floors made of pebbles from the eighth century BC that were found in Asia Minor. The Greeks were the first to produce enamel mosaic two thousand years ago, and the process travelled around the Mediterranean before eventually spreading to the adjacent continents. Byzantine craftsmen created an innovative style with their extensive use of rich metallic colors, and they had a great influence on the emergence of Venice in the thirteenth century as a leading, global force in enamel mosaic manufacture for hundreds of years. The deregulation of the industry and the lack of skilled masters contributed to the drastic decline of Venetian enamel mosaic workshops by the early 1800s; however, within a century, the industry was booming again, with new architectural mosaics being installed all over Europe and North America. By examining the religious, social, and cultural environment in Great Britain during the late nineteenth century, as well as by conducting a case study of Salviati enamel mosaics, this thesis will postulate that the Anglo-Catholic revival had a direct effect on the renewed popularity of Venetian mosaic architectural decoration. It will conclude that the increased interest in Catholic ritualism that was fueled by the Oxford Movement and advocated by ecclesiologists led to the revival of the Gothic style of architecture, which in turn helped boost a demand for traditional church decoration.",1238244126,,Dissertations & Theses," Kovach, Rita S.KovachS.RitaKovach, Rita S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2841511091 , 69168442 , 66569 , 9781267774767 , 1530139 , 1530139", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267774767, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1238244126?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0377 Art history"," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0377 Art history"," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0377 Art history",," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0377 Art history"," Religious history , European history , Art history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Anglo-Catholic , Gothic , Mosaic , Revival , Salviati , Tractarianism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Anglo-Catholic+revival%27s+contribution+to+the+resurgence+of+the+Venetian+enamel+mosaic+industry&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kovach%2C+Rita+S.&amp;isbn=9781267774767&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Global Geekdom: The Rise of Anime and Otaku in the Information Age,"This dissertation investigates the emergence and development of global anime (Japanese animation) and its fandom— otaku culture—in the context of the changing technological, social, and economic conditions of the current information age. By examining the global organization and activities of the network-based otaku subculture, as well as the narrative motifs and visual aesthetics of anime products, the dissertation decodes the trans-national, cross-media phenomenon of anime and otaku as a manifestation of a distinctive mode of techno-culture—so-called geek culture. The thesis argues that the visual/narrative forms of anime provoke unique consumer experience of cybernetic pleasure and techno-intimacy that are especially appealing to the cyber generation, and the worldwide organization and communication of otaku communities, which are characterized by massive user participation through vast computer networks, put forward a new mode of global cultural flow that I would call a distributive globalization. Both the textual qualities of anime and the fandom practices of otaku exemplify a large-scale global geekdom movement, which reflects a new cultural logic under the current socio-economic changes marked by the rising cultural capital of an emerging cosmopolitan knowledge class in a new global economy dominated by information capitalism.",1266251992,,Dissertations & Theses," Li, JinyingLiJinyingLi, Jinying",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2856344701 , 68460282 , 66569 , 9781267800404 , 3546450 , 3546450", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267800404, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1266251992?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," Asian Studies , Mass communications , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Animation , Anime , Geek , Globalization , Information society , Otaku",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Global+Geekdom%3A+The+Rise+of+Anime+and+Otaku+in+the+Information+Age&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Li%2C+Jinying&amp;isbn=9781267800404&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"When fear is substituted for reason: European and Western government policies regarding national security 1789–1919,"Although the twentieth century is perceived as the era of international wars and revolutions, the basis of these proceedings are actually rooted in the events of the nineteenth century. When anything that challenged the authority of the state—concepts based on enlightenment, immigration, or socialism—were deemed to be a threat to the status quo and immediately eliminated by way of legal restrictions. Once the façade of the Old World was completely severed following the Great War, nations in Europe and throughout the West started to revive various nineteenth century laws in an attempt to suppress the outbreak of radicalism that preceded the 1919 revolutions. What this dissertation offers is an extended understanding of how nineteenth century government policies toward radicalism fostered an environment of increased national security during Germany’s 1919 Spartacist Uprising and the 1919/1920 Palmer Raids in the United States. Using the French Revolution as a starting point, this study allows the reader the opportunity to put events like the 1848 revolutions, the rise of the First and Second Internationals, political fallouts, nineteenth century imperialism, nativism, Social Darwinism, and movements for self-government into a broader historical context. This background also underscores the problems between Austria-Hungary and the Ottoman Empire that resulted in the two Balkan Wars and the eventual Great War. By this point in time, 1914-1918, the structure of the Old World was shattered beyond repair and the social problems of the pre-war period were erupting throughout the west as ancient regimes collapsed, borders were redrawn, and new republics emerged. For nations like Germany, a Bolshevik revolution was thought probable since the state had been weakened during the war years. While Germany actually came closer to succumbing to the ideals of bolshevism, both the Weimar Republic and the United States government used this time as a means of further restricting civil liberties in an effort to rid the nation of radicalism and preserve the authority of the national executive. Therefore, instead of peace after the Great War, surveillance states soon emerged as nations rushed to eradicate all forms of foreignism from the national environment.",1272367502,,Dissertations & Theses," Flores, Norma LisaFloresLisaNormaFlores, Norma Lisa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2873873361 , 74946992 , 66569 , 9781267778383 , 3533544 , 3533544", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267778383, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1272367502?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history",," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," European history , American history , Modern history"," Social sciences , 1919 Revolutions , Balkan Wars , Germany , Palmer Raids , Socialism , Spartacist Uprising , Weimar Republic , World War I",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=When+fear+is+substituted+for+reason%3A+European+and+Western+government+policies+regarding+national+security+1789%E2%80%931919&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Flores%2C+Norma+Lisa&amp;isbn=9781267778383&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Pentecostalization: The changing face of Baptists in West Africa,"Over the past century, Pentecostalism has risen from obscurity to ascendancy in global Christianity. This ascendancy appears prominently in West Africa where Neo-Pentecostalism has transformed the religious landscape. Very few studies have examined the effects of the movement in the Francophone countries of Côte d'Ivoire, Burkina Faso, Benin, and Togo. Over the past two decades, Baptists in these countries have undergone a transformation. This transformation differs fundamentally from the charismatization of other mainline churches. Many denominations created space within the churches for Neo-Pentecostalism while maintaining their historical mission and foundations. In contrast, Baptists did not create space for Neo-Pentecostalism, but embraced and adopted the Neo-Pentecostal ethos; Baptists pentecostalized. This qualitative study examines this pentecostalization phenomenon among Baptists with particular attention on Togo. Most of the interviews were conducted in 2011. In addition, I draw on twenty-five years of experience with a Baptist missions agency in Francophone West Africa. Following an explanation of the research methodology and the historical context, I survey Pentecostal identity in Africa and identify five distinctive emphases of West African Pentecostalism—ethos, doctrine, worship, charismatic manifestations, and organization. The first core section treats the nature of pentecostalization. I identify five typical responses by churches; the characteristic practices of pentecostalized Baptists; three privileged traits—experience, charismatic manifestations, and warfare prayer; the influences on pentecostalization; and five effects of pentecostalization in terms of emphases, message, identity, polity, and church planting model. The second core section treats the contextual factors during three eras. In the first era, Baptists were exposed to Neo-Pentecostalism because of social and religious changes. In the second era, Neo-Pentecostalism gained a foothold because Baptists were ill-prepared for the movement. In the third era, Baptists pentecostalized because of shifting priorities during a critical transition. The third core section treats the appeal of Neo-Pentecostalism for Baptists. Neo-Pentecostalism secured deep roots among Baptists because it engages the African worldview, contemporizes well-being, reframes problem-solving, and promotes religious fervency. The final section of the dissertation summarizes the findings, suggests six implications of the analysis, proposes a response to the phenomenon, and offers avenues for future research.",1282124647,,Dissertations & Theses," Arnett, Randy RayArnettRayRandyArnett, Randy Ray",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2876398211 , 69273332 , 66569 , 9781267830821 , 3547950 , 3547950", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267830821, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1282124647?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology",," 0318 Religion , 0326 Cultural anthropology"," Religion , Cultural anthropology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Baptist , Neo-Pentecostalism , Pentecostalism , Pentecostalization , Southern Baptist missions , West Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pentecostalization%3A+The+changing+face+of+Baptists+in+West+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Arnett%2C+Randy+Ray&amp;isbn=9781267830821&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The cholera networks: Constructing imperial knowledge in the British Empire, 1817–1917","The cholera epidemics of the nineteenth century offer significant insight into the construction of imperial networks of knowledge in the British Empire. Cholera was a disease of mobility, made possible by the growth of social, political, and economic connections enabled by technology that, in a sense, made the world flat. People experienced cholera whether they traveled or not. It was a disease that came to them via letters, newspapers, pamphlets, medical journals, gossip, laws, and sometimes contaminated water. A person's knowledge of cholera could be an embodied experience, but also a psychological and intellectual one, in the sense that one could speak of knowing cholera without ever actually feeling its unpleasant effects. The construction of knowledge about cholera was an imperial knowledge project enabled by transnational cooperation and transmission, transnational in the sense that ideas about the disease were shared by letters and publications across Europe, the United States, and elsewhere, but developed as a result of information (both raw data and sometimes publication) provided by and produced by colonized peoples. The result was a web of knowledge that connected various people located throughout the British Empire. They shared information about the disease's symptoms and social effects, the conditions that might possibly contribute to its virulence, how to stop it, how to treat it, and who it was killing. The British Empire is an interesting canvas on which the cholera phenomenon can be understood, not just because it offers considerable documentation of the disease, but also because of its size and diversity. This dissertation examines the circulation of cholera discourse in the context of empire. It argues that over the course of the nineteenth century, cholera both destabilized British imperial power and secured it through its literal and discursive movement through the tenuous threads that made up the British Empire. British colonizers attempted to understand cholera and its epidemiological patterns through the accumulation of facts, many of which were obtained through relationships of power between colonizer and colonized. The interpretation of these facts in tracts and treatises, in letters and government reports, and the subsequent movement of the texts and their authors through the empire, constructed a fluid, expanding knowledge base of the disease that itself changed over time. This knowledge enabled the British to encode difference and create categories and strategies of rule that ultimately enabled a more secure projection of British imperial power. To better understand the development and circulation of cholera knowledge through imperial networks, this project examines a set of interrelated sites within three geographic areas controlled by the British: coastal South Asia, the Western Indian Ocean, and the Caribbean. It investigates specific localities that were either part of the British Empire as a formal colony, or within the realm of informal empire, that were also sites in some way affected by the cholera outbreaks. This dissertation concentrates mainly, though not exclusively, on connections between white, male Britons engaged in various aspects of the imperial project. However, it recognizes the significant contributions of non-white British subjects to the development of cholera knowledge throughout the nineteenth century. It examines in particular British civil servants, medical practitioners, missionaries, travelers, and military men who were either themselves located within the British Empire, or whom established connections via British imperial networks. All of these groups served the empire in different capacities, and were responsible for scripting both the empire and the colonized in orientalist ways. These people were engaged in various imperial projects that often conflicted, and consequently relationships between these groups were often tense. Cholera could intersect with and disrupt many of their goals, resulting either in temporary alliances or furthering the tension between them. The history of cholera in the British Empire is thus also, at least to some extent, a history of the collision of ecology and geopolitics. Cholera reveals the highly contested nature of knowledge production in the nineteenth century British Empire, particularly medical knowledge. The efforts of the British to understand the causes of cholera, or its effective treatments, were framed in terms of defending the West from foreign contamination. The multi-dimensional nature of imperial networks was laid bare by the movement of cholera microbes throughout the globe. This multi-dimensionality threatened the very purpose of British imperialism—the extension of British power of securing of global free trade. The cholera knowledge project, manifested as the accumulation, interpretation, and circulation of facts and texts, was thus essentially a mechanism of control, one of the ways in which the British could secure their power abroad. The interpretation of cholera facts changed over the course of the nineteenth century, and ultimately resulted in a gendering and racializing of the disease and its victims as it became increasingly associated with ""otherness”",1282399736,,Dissertations & Theses," Constance, Rachel LaineConstanceLaineRachelConstance, Rachel Laine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2877479871 , 69788792 , 66569 , 9781267840011 , 3548512 , 3548512", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267840011, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1282399736?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0564 Medicine"," 0335 European history , 0564 Medicine"," 0335 European history , 0564 Medicine",," 0335 European history , 0564 Medicine"," European history , Medicine"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , British Empire , Cholera , Disease , Imperial networks , Knowledge construction , Medicine",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+cholera+networks%3A+Constructing+imperial+knowledge+in+the+British+Empire%2C+1817%E2%80%931917&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Constance%2C+Rachel+Laine&amp;isbn=9781267840011&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Kin Aesthetics: Boxing and the Public Arenas of Modernism,"In July of 1892, the city of New Orleans legalized a form of prizefighting using gloves, known commonly as boxing. The act would begin the movement of the sport's epicenter from England to America, and set into motion the commercialization which aided boxing's dramatic rise in popularity and social acceptance in America and abroad. In turn, I argue, boxing would inform the aesthetics of modernist writers in Europe searching for ways to mediate violence. Grounded in the shared spaces, cultures, and practices of literary modernism and boxing, Kin Aesthetics pivots recent investigations into modernism and mass culture toward questions of social crisis, and argues for a new, ultimately globalized, understanding of modernism's adversarial culture. Literary modernism's relationship to commercialized cultures such as boxing has long been understood as its most intimate and fraught reckoning with the status of art in modernity. Challenging a longstanding perception of modernism's formal difficulty as hostile toward commercialized culture, ""Kin Aesthetics"" argues that modernist writers aestheticized boxing's violence and conflict in order to respond to the often brutal exigencies of their shared modernity: the ravages of the First World War and empire, as well as gender and racial inequities. Across four chapters covering authors such as George Bernard Shaw, Ernest Hemingway, Djuna Barnes, Ezra Pound, Mina Loy, James Joyce, and others, I aim to show how modernism's trials in pugilistic writing were less the collapse of a high/low divide or cultural transgression and more a set of novel claims about the ways that modernist writing could signify in the public sphere. The impact of American boxing culture on Eurocentric modernism not only challenges still-prevalent assumptions about modernism's elitism, but raises important questions about how we conventionally talk about American culture's global reach in the twentieth century. The modernism of Joyce, Pound, Loy, and others, represents a moment when embracing resistance, not resisting its embrace, was at the core of American mass culture as a global phenomenon.",1283093693,,Dissertations & Theses," Rhodes, Evan WrightRhodesWrightEvanRhodes, Evan Wright",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2879592481 , 70302432 , 66569 , 9781267864475 , 3535495 , 3535495", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267864475, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1283093693?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," American literature , British and Irish literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Boxing , Literary modernism , Sports violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Kin+Aesthetics%3A+Boxing+and+the+Public+Arenas+of+Modernism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rhodes%2C+Evan+Wright&amp;isbn=9781267864475&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Double Returns: Marking Loss, Memory, and Absence in the Korean Adoptee Diaspora","This dissertation explores the notion of ""double returns"" within the transnational movement of Korean adoptees returning to and from Korea.

Movie makers and television producers have become our most powerful, though perhaps not our most careful, historians. It seems fair to say that more people are getting their history, or what they think is history, from the movies these days than from the standard history books."" The film industry is influential. Moviegoers are influenced by what they see at the movie theater. But at the same time, films are produced to respond to cultural sensibilities and social mores. The films I have included successfully present a region uniquely characterized in the general public by its cinematic portrayal. This ""silver-screen Southwest,"" when viewed in relation to twentieth century social and political history, becomes a cultural landscape on which American moviegoers could project their hopes and fears for the future. As such, it becomes a vital tool in understanding the way Americans viewed this complicated border region and the people who call it home. This thesis begins with a brief introduction, setting the scene for the post-World War II film ""Golden Era"" where my narrative begins. In the early twentieth century, film was a new art form, and quickly grew in popularity. Through ""greaser films,"" social problem films, and the frequent depiction of Mexico and Mexicans, historians can easily see how what was happening in America was reflected on American screens. The Mexican Revolution, Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy, even the Great Depression heavily influenced these early films. In the mid-1940s and 50s, shifting international concerns fundamentally changed the way the United States viewed the U.S.-Mexico border. As hope for a Pan-American alliance transformed into fears of communist incursions, the relationship between the United States and Latin America began to change. As these conflicting doctrines clashed in Congress, an equally important struggle permeated Hollywood and the American psyche, and border films reflected this clashing ideology. Red River, Giant, Lonely are the Brave, all depicted the border, and the relationship between the United States and Mexico, in ways that echoed the growing social conflict brewing along the U.S.-Mexico border. United States involvement in Vietnam forced many Americans to see themselves as aliens in other lands. Given this seemingly new perspective, filmmakers began to use the Mexican north as a fictional front of the war, portraying Anlgo ""heroes"" as invading forces entering a sovereign nation. As the civil rights movements expanded, Chicanas/os argued for the native status of ethnic Mexicans in the Southwest. Thus, the film-based landscape of the Southwest changed, leading audiences to fear that Americans were invading aliens in both Vietnam and the borderlands. However, as the war came to an end, social attitudes returned to the perspectives of the 1950s despite Hollywood's continued favorable treatment of Mexican characters. 1970s border policy was defined by inaction and ineptitude, leading to growing rates of illegal immigration and public fears about America's unprotected ""back door."". Policies like the 1987 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) sought to address these growing border issues in a human manner. At the same time, a growing number of Mexican filmmakers attempted to combat the ""alien"" label Anglo America had placed upon Mexicans in the Southwest by creating a uniquely Chicano native or Mexicans in the Southwest. Filmmakers in the 1980s created films that focused on the human story of the border, giving a face to a people often lumped together as ""immigrants"" or ""foreigners,"" a people who had been scapegoats for U.S. border problems for decades. Films like The Border, Blade Runner, Born in East L.A., Lone Star, and Traffic questioned the status quo along the border through sentimental, human stories of border life. Beginning with the greaser films of the 1910s, border films embraced American exceptionalism and alien threats. The cowboy was the hero, the foreigner was the threat. America won the Southwest, Mexico lost it. However, as the Cold War came to an end, filmmakers embraced the human element of the border. Through these cinematic depictions, a fictional, film-based landscape was developed that reflected the hopes and fears of the American people.",1284848668,,Dissertations & Theses," Stonecipher, DustinStonecipherDustinStonecipher, Dustin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2885884831 , 75246442 , 66569 , 9781267868138 , 1532143 , 1532143", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267868138, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1284848668?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies"," American studies , American history , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Borderlands , Film , History , Mexico , Southwest , Westerns",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+silver-screen+Southwest+cinematic+images+of+Mexico%2C+Mexicans%2C+and+borderlands+history&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stonecipher%2C+Dustin&amp;isbn=9781267868138&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Voice and participation &amp;amp; technology in India: Communication for development in the mobile era,"This study is about communication power in the context of international development. Despite increased attention to participatory approaches in the international development field, the communities that are most affected by development programs still have little influence over development policy or programming. This dissertation is fundamentally a study about people's right to 'voice' in development processes, and the importance of voice in creating opportunities for actors at the community level to influence development agendas from the bottom-up. New networked technologies such as mobile phones and social media are creating seemingly unprecedented opportunities for bottom-up content generation and the expression of voice and participation in development processes, especially in India, the site of this research. The author draws on interviews with experts in communication technology and development program designers to investigate the uses of these communication technologies in India. In addition, as part of this research, the author partnered with the NGO Breakthrough to design and pilot Chatpati Chat, a mobile phone-based social media platform to promote the expression of voice through audio content production among women's rights youth advocates in Northern India. The findings from participant observation conducted during the Chatpati Chat project are used to explore what it means to promote 'voice' and participation in a mobile, social media age. This project is theoretically grounded in the notion of development as a discourse. It argues that development is a concept that is continuously socially constructed through discursive action. The field is also marked by certain 'dependency relationships' that reify hierarchies and grant certain actors greater influence and communication power than others. The author examines communication technologies as sites of contest over who has this communication power and who has authority to speak about development. Specifically, the study highlights case studies and examples from India that demonstrate three technological applications—community radio and the community media movement; social media initiatives for civic engagement; and the use of mobile phones to bring bottom-up content production to poor and marginalized users (including the Chatpati Chat project). In so doing, the author explores these projects' relationship to voice, and the effects of development discourse on both the projects' deployment and their participatory outcomes. The findings suggest that while new technologies often seem to destabilize existing power hierarchies--thus offering possibilities for greater amplification of previously marginalized voices—existing structures of communication power and the dependency relationships that constitute the development field often limit the ability to actualize these potentials.",1288834947,,Dissertations & Theses," Lapsansky, CharlotteLapsanskyCharlotteLapsansky, Charlotte",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2895301261 , 70537382 , 66569 , 9781267893437 , 3551505 , 3551505", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267893437, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1288834947?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Communication , Multimedia Communications , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Community participation , Development agendas , India , Information and communication technology , Mobile phones , Social media",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Voice+and+participation+%26amp%3B+technology+in+India%3A+Communication+for+development+in+the+mobile+era&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lapsansky%2C+Charlotte&amp;isbn=9781267893437&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"'Managing' Poverty: Care and Control in Peruvian Street Children's Everyday Lives,"This dissertation examines the contradictory and complementary ways in which both neoliberal development and children's rights legislation shape national development and child poverty in Lima and Cusco, Perú. It uses childhood as a lens through which to more critically analyze struggle over meanings of development, poverty and appropriate uses of public space, looking at the ways in which children's rights and neoliberalism shape the regulation of poor children through a number of spaces, including social services, urban space, and street children's everyday lives. The project is based on 14 months of in-depth ethnographic research, participant observation and interviews with street children, as well as conversations with policy makers, educators, government officials and social workers. My research design was specifically concerned with both recognizing children as active producers of knowledge and with connecting their everyday experiences with broader systemic changes and processes of development and governance. Rather than focusing on either a macro -scale or a more localized analysis, it links the subjectivity of the poor both with political-economic shifts and discourses and with identity projects. By focusing on street children's everyday lives, this dissertation combines work on the governance of poverty, most of which has remained focused on the global north, with insights from critical development scholars regarding a need for a historical and sociopolitical account of poverty to actively politicize the ways in which Peruvian street children negotiate control, care and survival. Despite beliefs that children are outside of politics, childhoods play important roles in shaping national development and reproducing particular value systems. This dissertation considers how linking dominant development ideologies with the language of children's rights serves to mitigate critiques that development negatively affects the poor, reinforcing dominant development ideologies by allowing them to be packaged in a more socially acceptable way. It analyzes in what ways children's rights discourse provides moral justification for international intervention and the increased regulation of childhood based on Western models. In doing so, it contributes to critical poverty and development studies by linking narratives of development, childhood and rights with the maintenance of poverty. However, rights themselves are subject to competing interpretations and have also provided an important organizing tool for local social movements, such as Peru's child workers' movement. Additionally, children themselves are not simply passive in the face of increased state intervention. They `manage' their poverty in varied and often creative ways, engaging in spatial strategies to evade police and social workers' efforts to regulate their behavior, creating work opportunities for themselves in the street, and in some cases, even playing up their own poverty and vulnerability in order to more successfully street vend. There is a danger, however, in celebrating all acts of survival as resistance. Instead, many forms of children's agency represent contradictory resistance; while in some ways they create more opportunities for themselves or avoid increased state regulation their actions often lead to further marginalization or work to exclude them in other ways. This necessitates both a more nuanced analysis of resistance as well as a need to more closely examine the indicators being used to measure international development and urban `revitalization'. My project concludes with an in-depth discussion of how feminist care ethics can inform more inclusive rights-based approaches to development.",1312764079,,Dissertations & Theses," Aufseeser, DenaAufseeserDenaAufseeser, Dena",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2902882701 , 69042052 , 66569 , 9781267914552 , 3552733 , 3552733", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267914552, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1312764079?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0630 Public policy"," 0366 Geography , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0630 Public policy"," 0366 Geography , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0630 Public policy",," 0366 Geography , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0630 Public policy"," Geography , Individual & family studies , Public policy"," Social sciences , Children's rights , Development , Peru , Poverty , Street children , Urban space",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27Managing%27+Poverty%3A+Care+and+Control+in+Peruvian+Street+Children%27s+Everyday+Lives&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Aufseeser%2C+Dena&amp;isbn=9781267914552&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Authentic Assertions, Commercial Concessions: Race, Nation, and Popular Culture in Cuban New York City and Miami, 1940-1960","Authentic Assertions, Commercial Concessions examines the relationship between popular black and white Cuban entertainers and the Cuban communities and broader Latino/a publics of New York City and Miami in the 1940s and 1950s. It uses the stories told by some of the key Cuban participants in the Latin music scene of this period as well as the public discourse produced in the Spanish-language newspapers in both cities as a window into a broader experience of Cuban ethnic identity. In New York City, Cuban migrants and musicians settled nearby and among much larger Puerto Rican and African-American communities. It was within these contexts that black and white musicians engaged with ideas about their music, race, and national identity. In Miami, Cuban migrants and musicians lived and worked in the context of a tourism industry and political climate that facilitated a massive back-and-forth movement between the United States and Cuba. Here, Cuban communities and Cuban ethnic identity developed in relation to the racial and political demands of Jim Crow and Panamericanism. In both cities and, indeed, in the broader realm of popular culture, black and white Cuban musicians—from Mario Bauzá and Machito to Xavier Cugat and Desi Arnaz—played key roles in shaping Cuban ethnic identity for others. Through their participation in music festivals, nightclubs, social clubs, and television and film productions and with the Spanish-language press acting as an important intermediary, Cuban performers also played a central role in constructing Hispano and Latino/a identity and culture. With Cuban music and musicians at the center, a relationship developed between national origin communities, nationalist cultural representations, and an emerging public defined by shared language, hemispheric solidarity, and transnational culture. Among the 90,000 Cubans settled in New York and Florida before the Cuban Revolution of 1959 were numerous musicians, who at times shifted seamlessly between critical and oppositional stories of race to discourses of musical nationalism and racial harmony. This dissertation examines what it meant to be Cuban, Afro-Cuban, Hispanic, and Latin on the stages, dance floors, television screens, and crowded streets of New York City and Miami in the 1940 and 1950s.",1316620221,,Dissertations & Theses," Abreu, Christina D.AbreuD.ChristinaAbreu, Christina D.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2914190781 , 76214492 , 66569 , 9781267940056 , 3554092 , 3554092", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267940056, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1316620221?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Latin American history , American history , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Cuba , Ethnicity , Miami , New York City , Popular music , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Authentic+Assertions%2C+Commercial+Concessions%3A+Race%2C+Nation%2C+and+Popular+Culture+in+Cuban+New+York+City+and+Miami%2C+1940-1960&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Abreu%2C+Christina+D.&amp;isbn=9781267940056&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Gruppe SPUR and Gruppe GEFLECHT: Art and dissent in West Germany, 1957 – 1968","This dissertation investigates the diverse interventionist art practices of Gruppe SPUR and Gruppe GEFLECHT. The artists pushed the boundaries of freedom of expression and explored the role of critical and oppositional art during changes in West German culture, politics and society from the ""economic miracle"" years through the protest movements of 1968. I demonstrate that Gruppe SPUR was the first collaborative utopian artist group in Cold War West Germany to create a new expanded notion of art to engage diverse audiences, redefine traditional conceptions of art and politics, transform social values, and challenge the authoritarian tendencies within the German state, church and society. Gruppe SPUR's unique aesthetic practices enlisted an interplay among multiple mediums such as painting, sculpture, drawing, etching, lithography, collage, site-specific work, and films; the self-production of magazines, manifestos and flyers; and the performance of actions in everyday life. In response to the emergence of pop art and the rapid transformation of European art markets and the West German independent gallery systems, the artists of SPUR and WIR changed their artistic strategies and formed Gruppe GEFLECHT in 1966. The GEFLECHT artists' adopted collective production and developed a singular group style in the form of their new aesthetic category, called the ""anti-object,"" which was an attempt to actualize their utopian aspirations to bridge the boundaries between art and life. This dissertation argues that the anti-object's formal language of interconnecting channeled networks embodied the principles of openness, experimentation, freedom, and anti-hierarchical relations, which were the same values that the GEFLECHT artists advocated for as participants in student protests at the Akademie der Bildenden Künste and the wider anti-authoritarian extra-parliamentary opposition in Munich from 1967–1970. Through a detailed historical and visual analysis of these two case studies, several broader issues central to artistic production during the 1950s and 1960s are explored: abstraction and figuration; individual, collaborative and collective artistic production; international avant-garde networks; and the role of art and artists in political, cultural and social transformation.",1316620366,,Dissertations & Theses," Graber, Lauren A.GraberA.LaurenGraber, Lauren A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2914199471 , 70638742 , 66569 , 9781267940254 , 3554111 , 3554111", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267940254, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1316620366?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Art and politics , Avant-garde , Cold War , Collaborative art , Germany , Situationist international",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gruppe+SPUR+and+Gruppe+GEFLECHT%3A+Art+and+dissent+in+West+Germany%2C%0A1957+%E2%80%93+1968&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Graber%2C+Lauren+A.&amp;isbn=9781267940254&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Battling the status quo: The discourse of the British Union of Fascists, 1932–1940","Scope and Method of Study: This study is an analysis of the language used in the British Union of Fascists Press's publication during Britain's inter-war period.

The propaganda printed through the British Union of Fascist Press was only partial cause for the movement's failure. The articles published by the British Union of Fascists Press correlated an imagined international conspiracy of the politically powerful, the press, the capitalists, and Jews with the victimization of the British people. Furthermore, the British Union of Fascists perceived the values of inter-war British industry society as decadent and materialist. The British Union of Fascists sought to regenerate society by renewing traditional social values, such as duty, honor, and sacrifice. The propaganda, published through their press, portrayed efforts to achieve this goal as an apocalyptic fight to save Britain's soul.

A Political Ecological Analysis of Organic Agriculture in the ""Model for Development""","In 2010, the South Indian state of Kerala's Communist-led coalition government, the Left Democratic Front (LDF), unveiled a policy to convert the entirety of the state to organic farming within ten years; some estimates claim that approximately 9,000 farmers were already participating in certified organic agriculture for export at the time of the announcement. Kerala is oftentimes hailed as a ""model for development"" by development practitioners and environmentalists because of such progressive environmental politics (e.g., McKibben 1998). Recent scholarship from Political Ecology, however, has christened organic farming as a neoliberal project, and much like globalized, conventional agriculture (e.g., Guthman 2007 and Raynolds 2004). Drawing from fourteen months of fieldwork in Kerala between 2009-2011, I explore this tension between Kerala as a progressive, political ""model,"" and globalized, corporatized organic agriculture. I utilize Kerala's experiences with organic farming to present another story about North-South relations in globalized organic farming. In contrast to recent Political Ecological work surrounding alternative food systems, I contend that organic agriculture can actually offer meaningful possibilities for transforming the global agricultural system in local places. Using Polanyian (1944) and Gramscian (1971) understandings of civil society and social change, I argue that Kerala's agrarian crisis of the 1990s, stemming from the commodification of Kerala's agrarian environment and the intensification of chemical-based, cash crop agriculture, stimulated an ecological countermovement in the late twentieth century. This crisis included several farmer suicides and pesticide-poisoning from Endosulfan. Kerala's civil society and political institutions actively developed this countermovement by relying on an existing institutional structure that supports redistributive reforms, and a history of political organizing by Kerala's Left. This ecological countermovement is now comprised of organic farming institutions (e.g., vanguard certification-centered bodies such as the Indian Organic Farmers Producer Company Limited (IOFPCL)) and policies (e.g., Kerala's 2010 Organic Farming Policy), that are re-embedding market-driven agriculture ecologically and socially. To augment my Polanyian analysis, I also utilize analytics from Global Commodity Chain and Global Value Chain scholarship, and rely on Cultural Political literature and the work of several Kerala scholars (e.g., Heller 1999 and Herring 1983), to argue that Kerala's organic farming movement is promoting the civic engagement of organic farmers in agricultural governance. Kerala's Organic Farming Policy, for example, represents an alternative form of state-led development that prioritizes local-level decision making. Finally, I explore the bifurcation of Kerala organic farming countermovement between proponents of Kerala's Organic Farming Policy and certified organic farming for export; each defines organic farming differently. I contend that this divide is not ""natural,"" but the result of a conjuncture of agrarian cultural politics, an ""imaginary"" of Kerala as a biodiverse ""hotspot,"" existing political priorities, and political economic and geographic changes in places like Wayanad District. This evidence illustrates that countermovements occur on and are shaped by terrains with history, and are far from monolithic. These findings also trouble the idealization of Kerala as a ""model,"" and demonstrate that organic farming politics can take on different forms throughout the world, contingent on local and global factors and dynamics. I conclude, however, that Kerala's organic movement does not have a predetermined future: it is neither destined to be a ""model"" nor homogenized and conventionalized by the forces of globalization. Evidence from Kerala instead elucidates that organic agriculture can offer a valid critique of chemical-dependent capitalist agriculture, but not necessarily in the way that current Political Ecological thought would prescribe.",1322967610,,Dissertations & Theses," Elizabeth Thottathil, SapnaElizabeth ThottathilSapnaElizabeth Thottathil, Sapna",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2933577331 , 72426952 , 66569 , 9781267976765 , 3556052 , 3556052", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267976765, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1322967610?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0438 Environmental economics , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0366 Geography , 0438 Environmental economics , 0503 Agricultural economics"," 0366 Geography , 0438 Environmental economics , 0503 Agricultural economics",," 0366 Geography , 0438 Environmental economics , 0503 Agricultural economics"," Geography , Environmental economics , Agricultural economics"," Social sciences , Globalization , India , Kerala , Model for development , North-South relations , Organic agriculture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%21ncredible+Kerala%3F+A+Political+Ecological+Analysis+of+Organic+Agriculture+in+the+%22Model+for+Development%22&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Elizabeth+Thottathil%2C+Sapna&amp;isbn=9781267976765&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"'Are We Now Equal?' Recent Experiences and Perceptions of South American Migrants in Argentina under MERCOSUR,"Broadly speaking, my thesis examines the workings of grounded social, economic and political processes that have contributed, often in a conflicting manner, to the (re)definition of membership criteria in both the nation and the state. It does so in dialogue with two broad, interrelated bodies of literature, those on citizenship and transnationalism, which have examined issues of belonging, exclusion, mobility and access to rights among transnational migrants, while highlighting the renewed capacity of the state to regulate both people's movements and migrants' actual access to public entitlements. My dissertation challenges three sets of claims shaping research and policy agendas on migrant transnationalism and citizenship, and questions the hegemonic analytical and methodological approaches underlying them. My research has been carried out at two distinctive analytical and empirical levels. On the one hand, I examine the “technologies of citizenship” (Ong 2003, Fujiwara 2008) deployed by the government to transform Argentina into a diverse, inclusive and Latin American nation over the past decade, paying particular attention to Kirchnerismo's creation of a “new legality” for the Paraguayans, Bolivians and Peruvians in the country. On the other hand, I analyze the “horizontal dimensions of citizenship processes” (Neveu 2005, Pickus and Skerry 2007, Gagné and Neveu 2009) among these migrants in urban, peripheral and rural areas of the partido of La Plata. Namely, I study the extent to which migrants' socio-economic circumstances have changed in tandem with their new legal status (as nationals of the MERCOSUR in Argentina with rights equal to those of its citizens) and the “inclusive citizenship” policies deployed by the government. My dissertation pays particular attention to the grounding and embodiment of rights by examining how migrants' new legal status translates into everyday life depending on a) where they live and work, and b) their perceived social status by other migrants and non-migrants. On the one hand, I look at urban, peripheral and rural areas of La Plata as zones of graduated sovereignty (Ong 1999) where particular governmentality regimes have emerged in tandem with the settlement of often ethnically marked groupings, whose entitlements and obligations differ from those in other zones. On the other hand, I examine how social status is produced through everyday social interaction by transposing socially constructed distinctions, such as race, class, gender and national origin, into formal systems of exclusion (Gregory 2007). My ethnographic analysis of what I shall call limítrofes' experiences of legality demonstrates that their formal equality vis-à-vis Argentinians, far from being merely given as a new legal status evenly guaranteed to all, is both unequally experienced by diverse migrants and differently enforced in geographic areas governed by distinctive governmentality regimes (Foucault 1978).",1353197784,,Dissertations & Theses," Recalde, AranzazuRecaldeAranzazuRecalde, Aranzazu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2974841661 , 74234872 , 66569 , 9780494976364 , NR97636 , NR97636", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780494976364, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1353197784?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Anthropologie , Anthropologie socio-culturelle , Argentina , Argentine , Citizenship , Citoyennete , Etat , Ethnographie , Integration regionale , MERCOSUR , Migration , Regional integration , Sociocultural anthropology , Transnationalite , Transnationality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27Are+We+Now+Equal%3F%27+Recent+Experiences+and+Perceptions+of+South+American+Migrants+in+Argentina+under+MERCOSUR&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Recalde%2C+Aranzazu&amp;isbn=9780494976364&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Medical doctors' views on complementary and alternative medicine: Moving toward integrative and equitable healthcare in Arkansas,"This inquiry asks medical doctors in the state of Arkansas about their views on complementary and alternative medicine (CAM). Specifically, this study asks doctors to consider the professional and social implications of discussing alternative medicine and integrative healthcare with medical colleagues and patients, and it assesses their personal experience with and professional evaluation of the following CAM modalities: deep breathing (e.g., meditation), gentle movement (e.g., tai chi, yoga), group prayer for health reasons, and herbal supplements. Qualitative research methods are used to conduct a basic, interpretive inquiry situated in a critical, eco-feminist paradigm. In-depth, exploratory interviews of a diverse group of 15 doctors yield rich descriptions of their perspectives and impressions. Research participants are medical doctors trained in Internal Medicine, General Practice, or Family Practice, who work in central Arkansas as physicians, researchers, professors, and health policy advocates and administrators. The goal of this inquiry is to seek a preliminary understanding of what context and research is needed to move toward integrative and equitable healthcare in Arkansas. Anticipated direct benefits include raised awareness among medical doctors of the value of CAM, increased discussion of CAM with medical colleagues and patients, and increased professional utilization of CAM in practice and research. Broader implications of this research relate to patient health, public safety, and social justice. Finally, this study is significant because it advances the holistic paradigms and global consciousness that undergird natural, alternative medicine.",1353712049,,Dissertations & Theses," Joy, Sister A.JoyA.SisterJoy, Sister A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2976967631 , 78906252 , 66569 , 9781267955067 , 3554860 , 3554860", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267955067, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1353712049?accountid=14496," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0640 Sustainability"," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0640 Sustainability"," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0640 Sustainability",," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0496 Alternative Medicine , 0640 Sustainability"," Multicultural Education , Alternative Medicine , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Education , Arkansas , Complementary alternative medicine (cam) , Health equality , Integrative healthcare , Physician perspectives , Transformative learning",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Medical+doctors%27+views+on+complementary+and+alternative+medicine%3A+Moving+toward+integrative+and+equitable+healthcare+in+Arkansas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Joy%2C+Sister+A.&amp;isbn=9781267955067&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Émergence, «fragmégration», et perpétuation des rébellions au Congo-RDC (1990–2010): Une politologie des groupes armés","This thesis aims to understand and analyze the logic of emergence, the dynamics of ""fragmegration"" and the mechanisms that contribute to the perpetuation of armed groups in Congo-DRC. From the outset we have highlighted three trends that monopolize the debate on the rebellions in the DRC. These three trends that were basically amplifiers or accelerating elements have been wrongly identified as key triggers. In order to remove any confusion between these two principles, we suggested three other ways that can better explain the phenomena of emergence, fragmegration and perpetuation of armed groups in DRC. These lines of thought are the major triggers around which we have structured and articulated our hypothesis. In this thesis, we support the argument that the phenomena of emergence and perpetuation of fragmegration are a result of the militarization of Congolese social forces, the inability of the regional movement initiated by the Rwandan-Ugandan tandem to win a Clausewitz war and the institutionalization of a complex power-sharing by the international community. This thesis is a call to overcoming decompartmentalization of school of thought and provides a multiplicity of points of entry to the study of armed groups. Hence the use of an approach (combinatorial) interdisciplinary, involving both critical currents in international relations (critical constructivism, geopolitics) while combining the sociology of international relations in particular the achievements of the political sociology of social movements. Our interdisciplinary approach that is central to this thesis can also be very useful in strengthening the polemological approach that is useful to understand the governance by the political-military groups.

From the 1970s to the 1990s representations of African women were based on women’s economic potential. The mainstreaming of gender in the 1990s resulted in women being represented as agents of change. This approach gave women an opportunity to play roles in decision-making but led to policies that failed to challenge the established institutions. The emphasis on women as agents of change opened doors to some African women but with implications for the women’s movement. Only some middle-class women appear to benefit but their gains have been marginal in comparison to the gender inequalities that persist.

Mobile devices accompany users to places where not even the closest of family and friends are allowed (e.g. office, meetings, conferences among other places). The access to these movement and network access logs from mobile devices can shed light on human behavior, which in turn can be used to solve several research challenges. In this work, we present our measurements, analysis and designs obtained by utilizing network traces collected at both personal and group level. We have used network traces from several thousands of devices to understand, identify and extract social markers or characteristics. The social markers we have studied include social grouping based on gender, proximity-based trust and the difficulty of anonymizing traces because of mobility. In the first part, we discuss how social-grouping information can be extract from anonymized network traces. Using a gender-based case study, we demonstrate our approach, along with different methods to validate the results. In the second part, we study the fundamental trade off between the utility of WLAN traces and privacy of the users. We show how privacy of users in anonymized traces can be compromised. In the third and the final part, we implement, and evaluate an effective framework to establish trust in mobile networks through a protocol that we call iTrust.

In so doing, it shows that women poets were concerned with precisely that problem: of poetry's political function. The work of individual poets and the acts of collective cultural production explored in this thesis articulate a radical, politically transformative poetics at a time when the continued existence of poetry was perceived to be under threat from scientific advance and wider cultural changes. Juxtaposing analysis of Left modernist poets with poets of the labour movement, the chapters focus on three individual poets including Muriel Rukeyser (1913-1980), Genevieve Taggard (1894-1948) and Miriam Tane (1916-2007). To provide an understanding of the role of poetry within a specific political movement and to establish the context in which Tane's poetry was produced, two chapters are included which analyse the educational culture and the collective cultural production of the International Ladies' Garment Workers' Union. One chapter focuses on the history of the ILGWU's educational and cultural activities and the other analyses collections of poetry which the union produced. This thesis challenges the existing paradigm in which the study of American radical Left and labour poetry has been isolated from any broader enquiry about its relationship to class, American political history and also to literary modernism. This thesis advances two main arguments: that the poets considered in this thesis conceived of poetry as a politically transformative force; that these politically transformative understandings of poetry were rooted in in an engagement with the ideological and material contexts of the social movements to which these writers belonged. Furthermore, this thesis considers poetry in terms of the material context of its publication, and the political uses to which it was put.",1415018973,,Dissertations & Theses," Veitch, Karen ElizabethVeitchElizabethKarenVeitch, Karen Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031654691 , 71870212 , 101309 , U589038 , U589038 , http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/43051/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1415018973?accountid=14496, 0582 Modern history, 0582 Modern history, 0582 Modern history, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0582 Modern history, Modern history," http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/43051/ , (UMI)AAIU589038 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+poetry+of+female+radicalism+in+depression-era+america&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Veitch%2C+Karen+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Brethren in the faeroes: an evangelical movement, its remarkable growth and lasting impact in a remote island community","The thesis comprises results of broad research into the Brethren Movement in the Faeroes from 1865 to 2010, emphasising the disciplines Church History, Economic, Social and Cultural History, Cultural Studies and Missiology. The role of Brethren in the Nation Building Process is analysed as well as their pioneering work in the language struggle. Drawing on recent theories the Faeroese Brethren Movement is set in national and international perspective. Interviwes with many Brethren confirm the validity of the theories and give insight into (1) the developments until the 1960s, and (2) the period after. New aspects are brought to light, analysed and seen as part of the general development in the islands, and how Brethren have influenced the national, economic and cultural progresses. Nowhere has the Brethren Movement had such support as in the Faeroes where around 15 per cent of the polulation are members; elsewhere it is between a half and one per cent at most. Reasons for this are analysed as are Brethren theology and practices, attitudes and activism which have influences the broader community. The conclusion points out that the Faeroese Brethren movement has had much greater impact on the progress and developments that so far acknowledged. Self-government, self-financing and self-propagation of each assembly have influenced attitudes outside the movement, and Brethren attitudes, pioneering spirit and new ways of thinking have inspired others. The Brethren Movement was the first to break away from colonial power (the Danish State Church) and establish a Faeroese church.

There are nine refugee camps along the Thai-Burma border.  Camp populations are subjected to extensive restrictions imposed by the Royal Thai Government, and the denial of freedom of movement and income generation has left refugees dependent on humanitarian assistance agencies for food and other basic resources.  However, day to day camp management is largely handled by a refugee-led camp administration which, among other functions, has responsibility for justice delivery. The impressive level of internal autonomy within the Thai-Burma border camps has attracted international recognition but no comprehensive analysis.  This thesis details the work of the camp governance system, its historical origins and its relationship with other normative orders.  Key themes are the camp as community; the production of order beyond the state, and justice as a contested site.  A struggle for normative control is identified between the three primary sets of actors engaged in camp governance – the Thai authorities, international humanitarian organisations and the refugee leadership.  The struggle to define justice is particularly pronounced between international agencies and the camp leadership and has had real practical impact in transforming social norms within the Karen refugee community.

This silence over the issue in this country can be attributed to the lack of awareness about its prevalence in our own back yard and the measures available against it. This silence is further compounded by economic, social, cultural and psychological factors.

In examining the nature of the impact with particular reference to Africa, this Thesis challenges the conventional scholarship which has so far concentrated on the impact of globalization on human rights, ignoring the possible impact of human rights on processes of globalization, and argues that in order to obtain a holistic view of the relationship between globalization and human rights, sufficient attention must equally be given to the corresponding impact of human rights norms on processes of globalization. In support of this formulation, three levels of analysis are adopted in the Thesis, namely; international, regional and national systems. It is argued that at the international level, the impact of human rights norms on processes of globalization is evidenced by the fact that international economic institutions such as International Monetary Fund (IMF), World Bank and World Trade Organization (WTO), which initially ignored human rights norms in their policies, programmes and operations, have now embraced such norms. At the regional level, the African Charter on Human and Peoples’ Rights, embodying human rights norms attentive to the African condition, has been used to constrain processes of globalization. Finally, using three African countries, namely, South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya as case studies, it is demonstrated that at the national levels, human rights norms are also impacting on processes of globalization, as the activities of transnational corporations, and those of governments based on the dictates of economic globalization, are being challenged by human rights NGOs and other social movements. It is on this score that the ‘Mutual Impact thesis’ is formulated, the contention being that for a proper understanding of whether the impact of globalization on human rights is positive or negative, a debate that has engaged the attention of some writers, the preliminary issue of the corresponding impact of human rights on globalization must also be taken into account.",1442495969,,Dissertations & Theses," Okogbule, Nlerum SundayOkogbuleSundayNlerumOkogbule, Nlerum Sunday",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101218391 , 80730242 , 101309 , U598813 , U598813 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3309/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442495969?accountid=14496, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, 0398 Law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0398 Law, Law," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3309/ , (UMI)AAIU598813 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+appraisal+of+the+mutual+impact+between+globalization+and+human+rights+in+africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Okogbule%2C+Nlerum+Sunday&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Automation, cybernation and the art of new tendencies (1961-1973)","My research investigates exhibitions as sites of research and appraises the possibilities and contradictions of a progressive and socially engaged media art practice. The international art movement New Tendencies (NT) (1961-1973) provides the material evidence through its exhibitions, symposia, artworks, catalogues, newsletters and artist's statements. The basic methodological assumption behind my research is that new insights are gained by questioning the various interdependencies between NT and historical change.  NT was searching for a synthesis between socialist emancipation and artistic modernism by proposing to replace the notion of art with visual research. The project emerged in Zagreb, capital of Croatia which was then part of Yugoslavia, a Socialist nation which did not belong to the Eastern bloc and experimented with market Socialism combined with social self-management and self-government. Yugoslavia's unique role between the hegemonic power blocs made it possible that an international, humanistic, and progressive art movement could emerge from its territory.  With every exhibition and conference NT articulated its artistic position and set itself into relation with the respective techno-economic paradigm. NT began during the height of Fordism, continued during Fordism's moment of crisis in 1968, and ended when a new paradigm – informational capitalism – started to develop from within the old one. In this historical context, my hypothesis is that NT's exploration of participatory art stands in direct relation to the rise of automation and cybernation in society. A further layer of inquiry is the historically changing relationship between manual and intellectual labour and how art addresses it.  By contextualising NT my research contributes a new dimension to the history of media art. Through the chosen methodology, a new understanding is gained not only of this important art movement but of the general dynamics of media art in the second half of the 20th century.",1442503996,,Dissertations & Theses," Medosch, ArminMedoschArminMedosch, Armin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3101291651 , 82356442 , 101309 , U598840 , U598840 , http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/6924/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1442503996?accountid=14496, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies, 0730 Museum studies,, 0730 Museum studies, Museum studies," http://eprints.gold.ac.uk/6924/ , (UMI)AAIU598840 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Automation%2C+cybernation+and+the+art+of+new+tendencies+%281961-1973%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Medosch%2C+Armin&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""Estamos en todas partes"": Male homosexuality, nation, and modernity in twentieth century Mexico","In broad strokes my research investigates the intersections between the nation, citizenship, masculinity, and culture as engaged through the lenses of gender, sexuality, and transnational flows of ideas and people. My project is a genealogy of what Mexican citizenship has and has not included as told through discourses on homosexuality and the experiences of homosexuals, a group that for the majority of the 20 th century were largely excluded from full citizenship. This did not mean homosexuals were unimportant; on the contrary, they were the foils against which the ideal Mexican could be defined and participants in both democracy and citizenship through their negation. The experiences and challenges faced by homosexuals illuminate the great, if gradual shift, from exclusive definitions of citizenship towards more universal forms of citizenship, however flawed, found in Mexico's current multiculturalism. In fact, homosexuals' trajectory from a maligned anti-Mexican group to representatives of pluralist democracy by the late 1970s sheds important light on how Mexico shifted from oligarchy through paternalist state-interventionism towards more participatory politics and towards an understanding of citizenship that incorporated pride parades as Mexican and homosexuals as worthy of state-sanctioned marriage by 2009, even as the structural causes of homophobia remained. Moreover, the convergences between local realities, national aspirations, and transnational flows of culture and ideas—all of which were fundamental in post-revolutionary Mexican nation-building—are best understood in relation to homosexuality. This work has two interrelated objectives: first to reconstruct queer Mexican men's lived experiences and second, to interrogate how effeminate homosexuals became not only popular cultural foils, but also crucial ""others"" against which Mexican national identity—as exemplified by the masculine patriarch—was defined. I thus examine Mexican queer sexuality in two registers: as a social historical formation of queer male identities and communities, and as a cultural historical articulation of Mexican national identity. I argue that the very category of ""queer Mexican (man),"" created as a pathology by social reformers, medical experts, and jurists, was foundational to the longue durée of political debates on citizenship and civil rights. Homosexuality was a key concern both in the formation of national identity, cultural icons, and ideologies that had far-reaching consequences, as well as for cultural, political, and medical-juridical authorities seeking to fashion Mexican modernity. As Mexican democracy was shaped through revolution, war, socio-cultural engineering, politics, and social movements, the line between those included and excluded from participation in that democracy remained unstable. This meant that what constituted a good citizen also shifted over time. Even so, at its core the dominant publicized ideal of the ideal Mexican citizen remained male, hetereosexual, hard-working in industry or agriculture, and a family provider. Between 1920 and 1960, the Mexican government embarked on an effort to solidify the nation through the propagation of this ideal citizen through propaganda, public art, education, cinema, and even Mexican-style wrestling. At the same time, numerous Mexicans resisted these definitions. For their part, homosexuals, rather than being obscured in the proverbial closet, challenged their exclusion and asserted that they were in fact model, law-abiding citizens, not anti-social delinquents, sinners, or criminals. In this way, their efforts foreshadowed the democratic opening that would accelerate in the late 1960s and beyond, as well as the eventual granting of more rights—including marriage—to LGBT individuals in the capital by 2009.",1447010451,,Dissertations & Theses," Jones, Ryan MichaelJonesMichaelRyanJones, Ryan Michael",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3112813471 , 82642152 , 66569 , 9781303509025 , 3600689 , 3600689", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781303509025, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1447010451?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Latin American history , GLBT Studies , Latin American Studies , Hispanic American studies"," Social sciences , Citizenship , Homosexuality , Masculinity , Mexico City, Mexico , Modernity , Nationhood , Political culture , Sexuality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Estamos+en+todas+partes%22%3A+Male+homosexuality%2C+nation%2C+and+modernity+in+twentieth+century+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jones%2C+Ryan+Michael&amp;isbn=9781303509025&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Cosmopolitan &lt;i&gt;comuneros:&lt;/i&gt; Celebrating indigeneity through the appropriation of urbanity in the Quito Basin,"My dissertation examines urban indigenous identity in the Quito Basin in contrast to essentialized representations of indigenousness that emanate from emerging multicultural state policy and prominent indigenous movements in Ecuador. Based on ethnographic research I conducted between 2003-2011, I focus on the indigenous identity celebrated in Lumbisí, an urban indigenous community that borders Quito. Dominant national stereotypes of indigeneity position Lumbiseños as culturally and ethnically assimilated members of Ecuadorian society (mestizos) or as unrecognized citizens of the Cumbayá Valley community. By contrast, Lumbiseños reject claims of assimilation and assert an indigenous identity rooted in their communal land rights, ancestry, traditions, and social networks. While Lumbiseños adhere to their own conventional markers of indigeneity, they also depend on urban earned salaries and related social capital to reinvest in their community. I argue that the local indigeneity recognized and practiced within Lumbisí represents a distinct urban indigeneity that selectively draws on urban capital, education, and interactions with non-indigenous others to reinvest in their community and bolster their indigenous identity outside the processes of acculturation, hybridity, and mestizaje. This dissertation contributes to long-standing discussions in the social sciences regarding the apparent tensions between indigeneity and urban modernity with relation to race, class, and emerging concepts of plurinational citizenship in Ecuador. I engage the influential ideologies of the folk-urban continuum (Redfield 1941) and blanqueamiento or the process of cultural and ethnic whitening through assimilation from various academic perspectives (Hurtado 2007, Quijia et al 2006, Stutzman 1981, Whitten 1981, Whitten 2003), which correlate increased indigenous contact with urban spaces with the loss of indigenous culture in favor of modernity and an idealized mestizo citizenship. In the case of Lumbisí, I argue that the more contact indigenous people experience within the city, the stronger and more empowered their indigenous identity becomes. I demonstrate that urban indigenous peoples choose to reinvest in their home community and identity by appropriating urban capital and prestige goods as an integral part of their indigeneity without implications of assimilation. I also provide insight to local symbolic, ideological, and performative interpretations of urban and global experiences in Lumbisí through the ritual analysis of large-scale, local festival production. Building upon recent Ecuadorianist research that underscores festivals as sites for the negotiation of new forms of rural indigeneity (e.g. Corr 2004, 2010, Wogan 2003, Wibbelsman 2005, 2008, and Fine-Dare 2006), my dissertation examines comparable processes in an overlooked urban case.",1447014326,,Dissertations & Theses," Williams, Julie LynnWilliamsLynnJulieWilliams, Julie Lynn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3112852901 , 80780452 , 66569 , 9781303509674 , 3600746 , 3600746", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781303509674, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1447014326?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Ethnicity , Identity , Latin America , Performance , Plurinationalism , Urban indigeneity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cosmopolitan+comuneros%3A+Celebrating+indigeneity%0Athrough+the+appropriation+of+urbanity+in+the+Quito+Basin&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Williams%2C+Julie+Lynn&amp;isbn=9781303509674&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A study of the reform process to provide an inclusive model of service delivery within a Manitoba middle years school,"Several current social agendas in the province of Manitoba are impacting the demographics in our classrooms. Recent changes to the Public Schools Act, the Educational Administration Act, an aggressive immigration initiative and a trend for movement from rural to urban settings have contributed to classrooms where the learning and behaving needs of students are diverse, their motivations to learn are different and they have varied areas of strength and weakness. In order to meet these new challenges and to provide educational programming that reflects the needs of our global society, schools need to change the way they are delivering service to students in schools. This study used qualitative research methods to examine the conditions that facilitate building an inclusive middle school in Manitoba. Data from both focus group interviews and a document study yielded multiple themes under the headings of actions, culture and strategies. A historical scan of the school’s reform process highlighting the changes in beliefs, leadership, structures and processes over time resulted from the data analysis. Collectively, the findings identify the specific steps the school took to move to inclusion. The information contained in this study will provide a path to help educators move to creating inclusive school environments where all students feel a sense of belonging and fulfillment from their educational experiences.",1490996557,,Dissertations & Theses," Mitchell, TammyMitchellTammyMitchell, Tammy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3187910071 , 79944712 , 66569 , 9780494957264 , MR95726 , MR95726", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780494957264, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1490996557?accountid=14496," 0450 Middle School education , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0450 Middle School education , 0727 Curriculum development"," 0450 Middle School education , 0727 Curriculum development",," 0450 Middle School education , 0727 Curriculum development"," Middle School education , Curriculum development"," Education , Inclusion , Manitoba , Service delivery",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+study+of+the+reform+process+to+provide+an+inclusive+model+of+service+delivery+within+a+Manitoba+middle+years+school&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mitchell%2C+Tammy&amp;isbn=9780494957264&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The mobilities of first generation pakistani migrants in newcastle-upon-tyne,"Modern life is constantly being affected by increasing forms of mobility. These mobilities allow for people to carry out activities that form and maintain relationships and networks on a social and obligatory basis. Complex mobility systems have enabled greater movement for many at local, national and international levels. Migration theories have been influenced by the mobilities paradigm and have led to the creation of new terminology such as ‘transnational migrants’. Both the needs of post-Second World War labour shortages and the political and economic climate of Pakistan (after partition in 1947) led to significant post-colonial Pakistani migration. This directed attention to life in the UK and resulted in and created new mobility dynamics. In terms of the research on which this thesis is based, face to face interviews took place, with a total of twenty eight interviewees that were carried out in two parts with the Pakistani diaspora living in the city of Newcastle upon Tyne who migrated up until the 1970’s. Evidence from the interviews supports the notion of the Pakistani diaspora holding on to its values and solidarity. Nevertheless a fluidity of identities has become the norm for this diasporic group and the concept of transnational citizenship has become a reality. Examples of social integration and identity formation are documented as are the political and health issues of main concern. Finally, the leisure and tourism activities have been analysed. A theme that is central to the group was health and as the natural ageing process sets in there are motility issues that affect their lifestyle significantly and health care needs.

Positioned within the social constructivist and critical research paradigms, the methodology involves a Foucauldian-inspired discourse analysis in which discourse is defined as a historically-situated, materially-embodied, and power-imbued set of statements and rules that comprise a unique and coherent representation of the world. A review of the climate change-related literature reveals four primary discourses on the phenomenon of rising greenhouse gas emissions: early scientific, climate modernization, climate change denial, and climate justice. The statements and rules of these four discourses, as well as the theoretical trends and sociopolitical, economic, and ecological factors affecting their historical development are described. A deeper analysis using 26 primary documents representing every major climate justice organization reveals that rather than a single coherent discourse, the climate justice movement encompasses four individual sub-discourses: global, peasant-oriented, Indigenous, and civil rights. Focussed on climate-related inequities in developing countries of the Southern Hemisphere, the global discourse constructs climate change as a problem of the structures and logic of the globalized capitalist economy. The peasant-oriented discourse emphasizes inequities to peasant farmers, and represents climate change as largely the result of industrialized agriculture and food systems. With specific concern for the wellbeing of Indigenous communities, the Indigenous discourse locates the cause of climate change in the “violation of the sacred” and the loss of harmony with Mother Earth. The United States-based civil rights discourse primarily emphasizes the rights and interests of African American communities and constructs climate change as a problem of externalized ecological costs and failure to incent a “green” economy. The relations of power between the four climate justice sub-discourses and the prevailing climate modernization discourse are tentatively explored on the basis of three indicators of strength (internal coherence, material foundations, and adaptive capacity), on which basis several questions related to discursive resistance are proposed as possible avenues of future research.",1511677600,,Dissertations & Theses," Keller, Emily MargaretKellerMargaretEmilyKeller, Emily Margaret",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3262276641 , 86510632 , 66569 , 9780499255273 , MS25527 , MS25527", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9780499255273, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1511677600?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Climate equity , Climate justice , Discourse , Environmental change , Environmental justice , Global south , Indigenous , Peasant farmers , Social justice , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Re-constructing+climate+change%3A+Discourses+of+the+emerging+movement+for+climate+justice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Keller%2C+Emily+Margaret&amp;isbn=9780499255273&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"On the margins of the states: contesting gypsyness and belonging in the slovak-ukrainian-hungarian borderlands and in selected migration contexts,"This thesis investigates the transnational migration of Slovakian Roma from the eastern borderlands of the European Union to Great Britain. Based on more than two years of ethnographic fieldwork in the village of Tarkovce and in several British cities, this study examines concrete pathways through which Roma come to migrate and experience their movement. For Tarkovce Roma, the most recent migration opportunity offers a potential means to carve out a sense of a viable life and of autonomy amidst the oppressive circumstances and asymmetrical relations they experience with non-Roma dominant groups and non-related Roma. I focus on Tarkovce Roma strivings for existential mobility, which condition their physical movement to the place of destination, and on their hopes for upward socio-economic mobility. I argue that migration enables Roma to contest and re-negotiate the hegemonic racial and social categories which historically place them at the bottom of social hierarchies. The thesis explores the unevenly distributed possibilities and complex inequalities that Tarkovce Roma encounter on their journeys towards realising their hopes in migration. I situate these differences within the daily sociability of Tarkovce Roma, intense webs of kinship and friendship ties, and key concepts of ‘soft hearts' and ‘heaviness.' I describe how Roma migrants come to occupy one of the most vulnerable positions in the British labour market and how they simultaneously, and constantly, search for other ways of making ‘big money.' Finally, I address questions of categorisations, in particular the internal differentiations between Roma, as well as the transformation that many Roma migrants encounter in British cities, from initial ‘invisibility' to ‘visibility'. By focusing on one particular neighbourhood in Glasgow, I analyse the shifting forms of ethno-cultural categorisations that mark Roma/Gypsy difference.",1512387348,,Dissertations & Theses," Grill, JanGrillJanGrill, Jan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264589871 , 86585392 , 101309 , U605793 , U605793 , http://hdl.handle.net/10023/3094", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512387348?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," http://hdl.handle.net/10023/3094 , (UMI)AAIU605793 , Social sciences , Hungary , Slovakia , Ukraine",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=On+the+margins+of+the+states%3A+contesting+gypsyness+and+belonging+in+the+slovak-ukrainian-hungarian+borderlands+and+in+selected+migration+contexts&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grill%2C+Jan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Re-presenting geopolitics: ethnography, social movement activism, and nonviolent geographies","This thesis starts from the premise that Geopolitics is performative, an iterative discourse “of visualising global space…reproduced in the governing principles of geographic thought and through the practices of statecraft” (Agnew 1998:11). During the last decade, two dominant discourses have shaped the contemporary geopolitical imagination – the ‘war on terror’ and ‘climate change’. These have steered conceptualisations of security and insecurity - performative iterations of who, where, and what poses a threat. The resulting geopolitical picture of the world has enabled the legitimisation of human and geographical domination – an acceptance of geographical norms that enable the continuation of uneven geographies. The research is concerned with the performative spaces of alternative geopolitics; spaces that emerge where nonviolent social movement activism and geopolitics intersect and the sites through which these are practiced and mediated. The motivations are twofold. The first is a desire to intervene in a critical geopolitical discourse that remains biased toward engagement with violent geographies. The second is to take seriously ‘geopolitics from below’, alternative geographical imaginations. I address the first of these through research that is concerned primarily with the spacing of nonviolence – the performed and performative spaces of nonviolent geographies shaped through a politics of the act. The second is approached through substantial empirical engagement with social movement activists and sites of contention and creation in opposition to dominant environmental geopolitics. ‘Militant’ ethnographic research took place over six months in 2009. It traced the journeys of two groups as they organised for, and took part in, large counter-summit mobilisations. The first was a UK based social movement, the Camp for Climate Action (UK). The second was an intercontinental caravan, the Trade to Climate Caravan. Both groups shared a common aim – to converge on the 16th of December in a mass demonstration of nonviolent confrontation; the ‘People’s Assembly’, to contest dominant discourses being performed inside the intergovernmental United Nations Conference of the Parties 15. Social movement groups from around the world would present alternative narratives of insecurity and offer ‘alternative solutions’ garnered through non-hierarchical forms of decision-making. The research followed the route each group took to the People’s Assembly and the articulations (narrative and practices) of nonviolent action.",1512397138,,Dissertations & Theses," Burton, KerryBurtonKerryBurton, Kerry",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264695641 , 86268022 , 101309 , U603443 , U603443 , http://hdl.handle.net/10036/3607", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512397138?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," http://hdl.handle.net/10036/3607 , (UMI)AAIU603443 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Re-presenting+geopolitics%3A+ethnography%2C+social+movement+activism%2C+and+nonviolent+geographies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burton%2C+Kerry&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""American literature and global time, 1812-59","American Literature and Global Time, 1812-59 explores the effects of the early stages of globalization on time consciousness in antebellum American literature and non-fiction. It argues that oceanic trade, extracontinental imperialism, immigration, and Pacific exploration all affected how antebellum Americans configured their national pasts, presents, and futures. The ensuing pluralisation of time that followed disallowed cogent conceptions of national identity. It analyses transnational geographies to examine how they transmit heterogeneous times. The project’s interest is in U.S. national sites that counterintuitively acted as fulcrums for the importations of foreign times and non-U.S. sites that interacted with and modified the homogenous progressive time of nationalism. As such, my project seeks to combine the transnational and temporal turns. It argues that the ethnic, racial, and geographic contestation emphasized by transnational critics found parallels in how antebellum Americans conceived of time. Conversely, it suggests that there were profound links between globalization and the sorts of instabilities in time identified by the critics of the temporal turn. Over its course my project identifies a series of “global times” that came into being in the years between the War of 1812 and the discovery of petroleum in 1859. These fall under three broad headings. First, what I term, entangled times that came about as a result of the movement of ships across borders and different social contexts; secondly, foreign local times that re-set the clock of imperialism and national progress; and, thirdly, a huge mass of reconfigurations in the origins and futures of the still-young United States.",1512399126,,Dissertations & Theses," Sugden, EdwardSugdenEdwardSugden, Edward",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264696461 , 86593342 , 101309 , U606127 , U606127 , http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:0c1a68fe-2e17-48bd-851b-00133ca256f0", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512399126?accountid=14496, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, 0591 American literature, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0591 American literature, American literature," http://ora.ox.ac.uk/objects/uuid:0c1a68fe-2e17-48bd-851b-00133ca256f0 , (UMI)AAIU606127 , Language, literature and linguistics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=American+literature+and+global+time%2C+1812-59&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sugden%2C+Edward&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Mobilisation and insurgent citizenship of the anti-privatisation forum, south africa: an ethnographic study","This thesis examines the mobilisation practices of one of the largest social movement organisations to have emerged in post-apartheid South Africa, the Anti-Privatisation Forum (APF). Making a contribution to the growing field of scholarship on the global justice movement, this thesis presents an analysis of the micro-levels of mobilisation in order to provide a deeper understanding of the everyday forms of resistance articulated and enacted by the APF and its affiliated community-based organisations. Locating itself within the political process paradigm as developed by Doug McAdam (1982, 1996), Sidney Tarrow (1988, 1994, 1998) and Charles Tilly (1978, 2008), the study of micro-processes of mobilisation is advanced through an analysis of the interaction between mobilising structures, political opportunities and framing, in order to tease out the internal political, strategic and organisational differences within the APF. I propose that the APF and its affiliates should be conceptualised as a ‘social movement community’, arguing that such a conceptualisation places a critical focus on the significance of political scale, the importance of space and place as well as a consideration of the political, social and cultural aspects of collective action. By combining perspectives from social movement theory with a Gramscian perspective on resistance and counter-hegemony, this thesis presents an empirically and theoretically grounded analysis of the conditions which both facilitate and constrain the emergence and practice of transformative collective action. With a close focus upon the internal practices of mobilisation, the analysis presented contributes to a flourishing field of scholarship which analyses social movements as alternative public spaces in which individuals contest dominant practices of citizenship and democracy and forge potentially counter-hegemonic relations. Utilising James Holston’s (1998, 2008, 2009) concept of ‘insurgent citizenship’ this thesis examines the paradoxes of the post-apartheid democratic settlement, where the constitutional rights which have been extended to all sections of the polity have been undermined by neoliberal policies which have resulted in the privatisation of basic services and reshaped relations between the citizen and the state. Furthermore, as I will demonstrate, the quality and experience of democracy post-apartheid has also been undermined by increasing violence and inefficiencies within the justice system. This thesis argues that social movements provide important spaces for the alternative practice of citizenship and democracy in which socio-economically marginalised groups seek not only to be accommodated within the polity but also challenge the economic, political and social foundations upon which the polity is built. However, while social movements may offer progressive challenges to hegemonic relations through the course of collective action it is also possible that some forms of inequalities will become further entrenched. Thus, the analysis which follows offers a critical account of the insurgent citizenship practices of the APF which considers how some forms of inequalities, particularly in relation to gender, may become entrenched through the processes of mobilisation.",1512399926,,Dissertations & Theses," Runciman, Carin FerrisRuncimanFerrisCarinRunciman, Carin Ferris",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264711641 , 80753382 , 101309 , U605467 , U605467 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3706/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512399926?accountid=14496, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, 0700 Social structure, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0700 Social structure, Social structure," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/3706/ , (UMI)AAIU605467 , Social sciences , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mobilisation+and+insurgent+citizenship+of+the+anti-privatisation+forum%2C+south+africa%3A+an+ethnographic+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Runciman%2C+Carin+Ferris&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Beyond Truth: Materialist Approaches to Reconciliation Theories and Politics in Canada,"In the last decade, reconciliation, apology, and forgiveness have become omnipresent forces in the international political sphere. Since the Nuremberg trials, strict retribution is no longer the responsible method for dealing with atrocity. Reconciliation offers conflict resolution that redresses historical injustice by appealing to reparative models of justice aimed at healing the rifts between victims and perpetrators. In 2006, Canada became the latest country to adopt a state-sponsored process of reconciliation. The Canadian Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) was established to “contribute to truth, healing and reconciliation” (“Schedule ‘N’”, 1) between Native and non-Native groups in Canada. This dissertation maps out the history of reconciliation as it is connected to Canada and identifies the ways in which the TRC facilitates and confounds conflict resolution in a colonial state. By critically analysing contemporary literature, film, politics and social movements, my dissertation develops a materialist approach to reconciliation via the ideas of “the call,” apology, reparation and forgiveness, applying these ideas to the lived experience (emotional, political, financial) that individuals and communities have to contend with in the reconciliatory process. In this dissertation I argue against those who suggest that the emergence of reconciliation in the modern era indicates that the international community is “returning to harmony” (Wagamese 134). As opposed to defining it as an indicator of burgeoning ethical politics, I suggest that “reconciliation,” particularly in how it is being articulated in settler states, is being deployed as a means to close off difference and contradiction and facilitate self-interest. As such, reconciliation must be approached as an ideological instrument rather than as “a potentially new international morality” (Barkan ix).

It is now at the epicenter of world turbulence and turmoil. It has been the source of political terrorism and extremism, gender discrimination, attitudes of religious and cultural supremacy, as well as movements for social justice and personal spiritual transformation. It has served as a model for an ideal society and state based on Prophet Muhammad's governance of the nascent Muslim community. Today, as a worldview or weltanschauung, Islam inspires profound levels of devotion and mysticism, as well as Islamophobia, sectarian strife, and religious bigotry. Islam is clearly a faith in crisis. This hermeneutic study explores the shadow of Islam's trajectory from its conception to the Arab Spring, within the context of its complex history and cultural diversity. It critically examines the opening chapter of the Qur'an, considered by Muslims to be a direct revelation of the Divine Will. Comprised of seven verses known as al-Fatiha, The Opening, it is thought to contain the quintessence of the entire Qur'an. Muslims recite al-Fatiha multiple times in daily canonical prayers, which guide and inspire the souls and psyche of 1.65 billion adherents of Islam. Using the eco-archetypal image of the Gardens of Paradise, the soul's ultimate destination, the hermeneutic methodology engages alchemical, imaginal, and ecological dialogues to approach the sacred text from various perspectives of the depth and transpersonal psychological tradition. It explores the psychological contents of al-Fatiha in order to formulate an Integral Psychology of Islam, inspired by Ken Wilber's four quadrant model of psychology. The Qur'anic Gardens of Paradise, al-Janna, are fed by the four rivers of water, milk, honey, and wine. At its center is a fountain named Salsabil. This study uncovers the psychological implications of al-Fatiha within the context of the four rivers of self psychology, social and political psychology, cultural psychology, transpersonal psychology, and the fountain of feminine psychology, in pursuit of a future of peace and equilibrium through an enlightened Islam.",1518912047,,Dissertations & Theses," Ebrahim, JalaledinEbrahimJalaledinEbrahim, Jalaledin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3284975891 , 87108262 , 66569 , 9781303734076 , 3612152 , 3612152", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781303734076, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1518912047?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0451 Social psychology , 0603 Counseling Psychology"," 0318 Religion , 0451 Social psychology , 0603 Counseling Psychology"," 0318 Religion , 0451 Social psychology , 0603 Counseling Psychology",," 0318 Religion , 0451 Social psychology , 0603 Counseling Psychology"," Religion , Social psychology , Counseling Psychology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Psychology , Depth psychology , Depth psychotherapy , Integral psychology , Islam , Islamic psychology , Transpersonal psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Towards+an+integral+psychology+of+Islam%3A+From+%22al-Fatiha%22%2C+the+opening%2C+to+the+Gardens+of+Paradise&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ebrahim%2C+Jalaledin&amp;isbn=9781303734076&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Resistance, rootedness and mining protest in phulbari","This thesis is concerned with the dynamics and social morphology of resistance to mining in Bangladesh. Using the case of on-going resistance to a government supported open-pit coal mine project proposed by Asia Energy Corporations in Phulbari, Northwest Bangladesh, it considers the resistance within a particular context while investigating how the ideas held by various groups intersect and conflict in developing networks of resistance. Through ethnographic engagement in a particular ‘community', as well as with the activism at the national level, the research attempts to explore how and to what extent the connection and disjuncture of observations and experiences of particular groups shape the resistance movement. The aims of this thesis are two fold. Firstly it expands on anthropological accounts of social movements' rootedness in patterns of daily life. As such I examine how local resistance to mining initiatives emerges in specific contexts and around such located concerns that often remain unexpressed in the public discourse of protests. I show how resistance builds around anxieties of losing ‘home' and accompanying rights and claims. Secondly, this research contributes to the anthropological analysis of ‘connection' and ‘network' in this ‘global' era. Through an ethnographic study of the resistance movement against mining I show how the movement's network is not a smooth integration of groups and actors; tension and ambiguity is central to it. I look at the ways in which friction of disparate ideas attached to different level of analysis, i.e. ‘local', ‘national' and ‘universal', pave way for the formation of tentative alliances as the differential observations come to fit into the common discourses of protest.",1534975027,,Dissertations & Theses," Nuremowla, Sadid AhmedNuremowlaAhmedSadidNuremowla, Sadid Ahmed",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3331691071 , 80734132 , 101309 , U609120 , U609120 , http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/41425/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1534975027?accountid=14496, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, 0629 Labor relations, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0629 Labor relations, Labor relations," http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/41425/ , (UMI)AAIU609120 , Social sciences , Bangladesh",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Resistance%2C+rootedness+and+mining+protest+in+phulbari&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nuremowla%2C+Sadid+Ahmed&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Interrogating the post-political: the case of radical climate and climate justice movements,"Between mid-2006 and late-2010 the UK experienced a parabola of spectacular protests relating to climate change, ranging from the occupation of airport taxiways through to the blockade of coal power stations. Mobilizing thousands of people, this ‘radical climate movement’ was distinguished from a popular concern with climate change by its general commitment to direct action, widely-held anti-capitalist and anti-authoritarian beliefs, and a stated focus of tackling the ‘root causes’ of climate change. Written from within this ‘radical climate movement’, this thesis is an investigation into the praxis of the movement, exploring the extent to which participants contributed to the emergence of a ‘radical’ knowledge of climate change, and thus assessing the appropriateness (and effectiveness) of the movement’s methodologies. Driven by an internal debate regarding the movement’s tendency to depart from its radical political roots, the theoretical core of this thesis draws upon the concept of the ‘post-political condition’, a condition of the liberal consciousness that forecloses the very possibility of a political praxis on the climate. It is contended that a specific post-political discourse of ‘dangerous climate change’ emerged in the late-1980s which, defined by an apocalyptic discourse that placed a ‘carbon fetishism’ at the core of its rationale, evacuated the space for political discourse in favour of a general humanitarian effort to forestall “the greatest danger we’ve ever faced”. It is suggested that despite the efforts of many to confront the problem, the UK’s ‘radical climate movement’ broadly failed to escape this liberal discourse. The research thus turns to the international mobilizations around the COP15 in 2009, concluding that the emergence of a discourse of ‘climate justice’ was a partial attempt to overcome this post-political discourse. From the World People’s Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth (CMPCC) in Bolivia, to the continued organization of the Climate Justice Action (CJA) network, it is suggested that ‘climate justice’ diverged according to two separate discourses - one around ‘climate debt’ and another around anti-capitalist critique. It is finally concluded that a true politicization necessitates celebrating the death of the environmental movement, instead placing our social reproduction at the core of any claim to an ecological politics.",1535004576,,Dissertations & Theses," Russell, Bertie ThomasRussellThomasBertieRussell, Bertie Thomas",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3331753451 , 82333832 , 101309 , U609587 , U609587 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/3348/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1535004576?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/3348/ , (UMI)AAIU609587 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Interrogating+the+post-political%3A+the+case+of+radical+climate+and+climate+justice+movements&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Russell%2C+Bertie+Thomas&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Explaining violence against civilians in ethno-nationalist conflicts: the cases of Northern Ireland and Israel/Palestine.,"The PhD thesis seeks to explain why violence is used against civilians by militant groups in ethno-nationalist conflicts at certain points during the conflict. The theoretical framework developed for the research is based on social movement theory, with a focus on political opportunity structures (political opportunities and constraints), as well as mobilising structures and the cultural framing of the conflict. Unlike terrorism or security studies theory, social movement theory regards protest as legitimate and existing on a continuum, rather than viewing political violence as an aberration without a historical and political context. In addition to the theoretical development and application of social movement theory, fieldwork and interviews were conducted, and primary research databases were created to trace the killing of civilians by the militant groups. The case of Northern Ireland and the Provisional IRA was selected because of the specific strategic tactics used in the campaign and because there were low levels of violence against civilians (relative to international standards). The case of Israel/Palestine, Hamas and the Al Aqsa Martyrs Brigades was chosen because the strategies evolved differently and there were high levels of violence against civilians. Both cases were also chosen because of the explicitly political development of the militant groups involved, and the comparable support bases and issues of grievance regarding occupation and repression. But crucially the case studies were chosen because there was variance between the two case studies regarding the resort to targeting civilians, leading to two different outcomes. The thesis creates a model, by using the social movement theory concepts of political opportunities, political constraints, mobilising structures and cultural framing, which can explain why we see violence against civilians at certain points in a conflict. The research findings are that when political opportunities are low, political constraints are high, mobilising structures are low and cultural framing is low, then the resort to violence against civilians is constrained/lowered. However, when political opportunities are high, constraints are low, mobilising structures are high and cultural framing is high, then the resort to violence against civilians is enabled/higher. These findings offer significant insights for policy makers as to how to constrain the resort to violence by militant groups and also how to induce militant groups towards a peaceful settlement, by engaging with the structures involved.",1535034619,,Dissertations & Theses," De Burca, A.De BurcaA.De Burca, A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3331857841 , 88338992 , 101309 , U610248 , U610248", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1535034619?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU610248 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Explaining+violence+against+civilians+in+ethno-nationalist+conflicts%3A+the+cases+of+Northern+Ireland+and+Israel%2FPalestine.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=De+Burca%2C+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Seán murray, the irish republican left and international communism, 1916-1962","This thesis focuses on Irish communism and the republican left, using Seán Murray’s political career as a nexus between Ireland and the international context. Using newly released and previously under-utilised archival material, the thesis concentrates on two main issues. Firstly, it addresses Murray’s relationship with the international communist movement, challenging and adding nuances to extant research on Irish ‘Stalinism’. Murray had a firm grasp of Marxist-Leninist theory, tactics and methods of organisation. Yet he endured a complex and difficult relationship with the international communist hierarchy and with the Communist Party of Great Britain (CPGB) in particular. Murray developed independent, nationally specific policies and tactics for the Communist Party of Ireland (CPI), often arguing for a liberal interpretation of Comintern policy. In fact, on a number of occasions, he anticipated shifts in Comintern thinking. Secondly, the thesis examines socialist republicanism between 1916 and 1962 from Murray’s perspective. It argues that a proclivity to pursue communist-republican alliances brought out in Murray both the crudest and most advanced forms of socialist republican thinking. Unique in his era, Murray combined aspects of Marxism-Leninism with fundamentally Connollyist analyses of Irish conditions and demonstrated an understanding of imperialism on two levels. He failed to develop a communist-republican synthesis. However, in the final analysis, he articulated an inclusive, left social democratic vision of republicanism which drew upon diverse sources of inspiration.",1548710038,,Dissertations & Theses," Byers, SeanByersSeanByers, Sean",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3385943911 , 89357242 , 101309 , U611300 , U611300", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1548710038?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," (UMI)AAIU611300 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Se%C3%A1n+murray%2C+the+irish+republican+left+and+international+communism%2C+1916-1962&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Byers%2C+Sean&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Transnational networks and nation-building: The protest of Barágua and the transition from plantation societies to the modern nation-state in Cuba and the Americas,"The formation of transnational ties, and the forging of transnational relationships between non-governmental organizations and politically marginalized groups, is often interpreted as a late twentieth century cultural phenomenon. This work challenges that supposition by examining the cultural practice of transnationalism during the last quarter of the nineteenth century in Cuba and other parts of the Americas. The historical process of nation-building, taken by a body of Cuban dissidents primarily from eastern Cuba, and their allies in the United States and the other islands of the Anglophone Caribbean, presents a new view of interpreting the rise of nationalist movements in the Americas. The practice of nation-building fostered by this group of social actors occurred culturally and historically alongside the emergence of a civil sector that included the growing importance of locally developed social institutions. The proliferation of political clubs, literary salons, and other civic organizations, analytically results in the reformulation of interdisciplinary questions regarding territorial belonging in the colonial, national, and imperial space of modern national and post-colonial territories in the American region. Expressions of locality and translocality are seen as critical markers of group and individual identity that problematicizes national belonging between and among economically, politically, and socially marginalized groups. Both the disciplines of history and cultural anthropology are better served by understanding the significance of migration and the creation of diasporic communities as resulting from nationalism as practiced during this period. Moreover, contemporary development policy that analyzes emergent civil sector institutional relationships and how these relationship impact gender, race, ethnicity, and economic identity transformations is also served. This dissertation utilizes the historical event, La Protesta de Barágua/The Protest of Barágua during the last quarter of the nineteenth century in Cuba as the organizing and analytical framework to examine the cultural complexity of nation-building as practiced through the creation of translocal relationships both individually and institutionally and the grievances articulated by within these marginalized communities and their institutional forms. The ethnohistorical lens that this specific event provides is one whereby, the experience of transition from plantation society to modern nation-state as experienced by marginalized groups such as Chinese migrant indentured laborers, poor and elite women, free people of color and slaves, is critically examined. This work does not seek to participate in “national-history” making, but instead gives insight into the consistent cultural flows of people and ideas within a dialogic chain of communication that was systemic and mutually influential. Hence, for these groups to gain greater political inclusion within the modern nation-state, a hemispheric process, articulated in political thoughts and actions, utilizing anti-colonial, nationalist, antislavery, and abolitionist political ideologies and rhetoric, was used by members of the dissident community in this work. Spanish colonial records, dissident political pamphlets, and a re-examination of secondary sources in Latin American and Caribbean history and cultural anthropology, each serve as the evidentiary basis for this work. Therefore, the hemispheric significance of La Protesta de Barágua/The Protest of Barágua, is interpreted as an articulation of not merely a culturally specific Cuban event, but within broader hemispheric struggles by other dissident groups that called for the immediate abolition of slavery as a critical step for creating equality among each of the constituent parts of the citizenry within the nation.",1562194396,,Dissertations & Theses," Hazard, Ethel R.HazardR.EthelHazard, Ethel R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3433303401 , 82642152 , 66569 , 9781321129489 , 3633300 , 3633300", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781321129489, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562194396?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," African American Studies , Black studies , Cultural anthropology , Caribbean Studies , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , African-American , Anthroplogy , Cuba , Cultural anthropology , History , International relations , Latin America , Latin American studies , Nationalism , Political theory , Social science , Spanish America",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+networks+and+nation-building%3A+The+protest+of+Bar%C3%A1gua+and+the+transition+from+plantation+societies+to+the+modern+nation-state+in+Cuba+and+the+Americas&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hazard%2C+Ethel+R.&amp;isbn=9781321129489&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Religious women in modern American social reform: Evangeline Booth, Aimee Semple Mcpherson, Dorothy Day, and the rhetorical invention of humanitarian authority","This dissertation analyzes the contributions of three prominent women religious leaders to 1920s and 30s public debates over how to best address extreme human needs. To enter the debates, these women had not only to offer compelling visions of religiously inspired social service, but to distance themselves from the older Victorian cultural ideals of “charity” that were being dramatically challenged by the development of “scientific” standards and state-based authority in humanitarian endeavors. This study compares and contrasts the rhetorical efforts of Evangeline Booth (the American Commander of the Salvation Army), Aimee Semple McPherson (founder of the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel), and Dorothy Day (co-founder of the Catholic Worker movement). I argue that each leader variously invoked her femininity and her religion in ways which spoke to the humanitarian crises of her age and simultaneously appropriated and challenged the “modern” social welfare agenda before her. This study begins by examining how late-nineteenth-century religious women leaders were empowered by a model of female moral authority based in Victorian ideals of female purity and piety, before showing how that ideological basis was challenged by the early-twentieth-century rise of scientific and state-based philosophies meant to address humanitarian crises more effectively. It then traces the ways Booth, McPherson, and Day presented alternate inspired visions of humanitarian care, while reframing the role of both women and religion in the new “modern” humanitarian sphere. The rise of scientific, state-based approaches to meeting extreme human needs was not simply a challenge to older Victorian notions of religiously based female moral authority; rather it was an agent of the transformation of both “religion” and the moral ethos of women in the humanitarian sphere.",1564042194,,Dissertations & Theses," Marsh, Sabrina NoelleMarshNoelleSabrinaMarsh, Sabrina Noelle",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3439016791 , 80781352 , 66569 , 9781321131444 , 3633373 , 3633373", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781321131444, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1564042194?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0459 Communication , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0459 Communication , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric",," 0459 Communication , 0679 Language , 0681 Rhetoric"," Communication , Language , Rhetoric"," Language, literature and linguistics , Communication and the arts , Aimee Semple Mcpherson , Evangeline Booth , Humanitarianism , Religious rhetorics , Social reform rhetorics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Religious+women+in+modern+American+social+reform%3A+Evangeline+Booth%2C+Aimee+Semple+Mcpherson%2C+Dorothy+Day%2C+and+the+rhetorical+invention+of+humanitarian+authority&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Marsh%2C+Sabrina+Noelle&amp;isbn=9781321131444&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Spatializing the writing center: Productions of social space through ideologies, interactions, and agents","This dissertation examines the varying productions of social space at two writing centers and considers how these spaces materialize at different levels of conception and activity.

An examination of the historical development of Czech theatre foregrounds the discussion of contemporary practice, charting its changing social-political role in domestic and international contexts. Theatre’s significance in forging an ethnolinguistically defined national consciousness is considered as a legacy that continues to impact the field. Theatrical values originating in the nineteenth-century national revival are traced through the interwar avant-garde, dissident small theatre movement of the 1960s and auteur’s theatre of the 1970s and 1980s. The Velvet Revolution of 1989 and theatre artists’ contributions to the defeat of communism are considered as catalysing a period of self-reflexivity, as theatres grappled with new logistical infrastructures and faced a crisis of purpose both dramaturgical and social ins cope. These changes are framed by discussion of the divergent visions of the country’s future posited by Václav Havel and Václav Klaus throughout the 1990s, as well as tensions surrounding European Union ascension and other globalizing processes. A close examination of the nové divadlo infrastructure that has arisen in the past twenty years identifies the strategies by which this faction of the field has forged a third theatre- making space, distinct from either the repertory system or the pre-revolution avant-garde. Central to this discussion is a consideration of the nové divadlo’s companies, venues and festivals as both reactive and active: responding to an increasingly international city and, simultaneously, actively positioning Czech theatre on world stages. The work and critical reception of Farma v jeskyni (Farm in the Cave) and Krepsko, both self-defining as “international” by virtue of their composition and international touring presence, are considered with regard to the companies’ dramaturgy, methodology and social function. Finally, the thesis considers how the work of the new theatre movement and, specifically, Farma v jeskyni, constitutes a “practical politics” rooted in the political philosophy of Havel and Jan Patočka.",1654741706,,Dissertations & Theses," McFadden, RebeccaMcFaddenRebeccaMcFadden, Rebecca",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3588361331 , 94014362 , 101309 , U620922 , U620922 , http://research.gold.ac.uk/8714/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1654741706?accountid=14496, 0459 Communication, 0459 Communication, 0459 Communication, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0459 Communication, Communication," http://research.gold.ac.uk/8714/ , (UMI)AAIU620922 , Communication and the arts",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Performance+beyond+borders+in+twenty-first+century+prague%3A+topography+of+a+new+theatre-making+context&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McFadden%2C+Rebecca&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The right to information act in india: the turbid world of transparency reforms,"The enactment of the national Right to Information (RTI) Act in 2005 has been produced, consumed and celebrated as an important event of democratic deepening in India both in terms of the process that led to its enactment (arising from a grassroots movement) as well as its outcome (fundamentally altering the citizen-state relationship). This thesis problematises this narrative and proposes that the explanatory factors underlying this event may be more complex than thus far imagined. First, the leadership of the grassroots movement was embedded within the ruling elite and possessed the necessary resources as well as unparalleled access to spaces of power for the movement to be successful. Second, the democratisation of the higher bureaucracy along with the launch of the economic liberalisation project meant that the urban, educated, high-caste, upper-middle-class elite that provided critical support to the demand for an RTI Act was no longer vested in the state and had moved to the private sector. Mirroring this shift, the framing of the RTI Act during the 1990s saw its ambit reduced to the government, even as there was a concomitant push to privatise public goods and services. Third, the thesis locates the Indian RTI Act within the global explosion of freedom of information laws over the last two decades, and shows how international pressures, embedded within a reimagining of the role of the state vis-à-vis the market, had a direct and causal impact both on its content, as well as the timing of its enactment. Taking the production of the RTI Act as a lens, the thesis finally argues that while there is much to celebrate in the consolidation of procedural democracy in India over the last six decades, existing economic, social and political structures may limit the extent and forms of democratic deepening occurring in the near future.",1687700431,,Dissertations & Theses," Sharma, PrashantSharmaPrashantSharma, Prashant",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713029911 , 96791862 , 101309 , U640291 , U640291 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/579/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687700431?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0398 Law , 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0398 Law , 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies", Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library.," 0398 Law , 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Law , Public policy , South Asian Studies"," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/579/ , (UMI)AAIU640291 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+right+to+information+act+in+india%3A+the+turbid+world+of+transparency+reforms&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sharma%2C+Prashant&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Eu law and the question of justice,"This thesis argues that European Union law can serve as an instrument for the extension of the values of justice beyond the nation state. Approaching the question of justice from this perspective, however, presupposes three things: it challenges us to think beyond the contractarian reflex that equates justice with political self-determination by a demos; it demands that we allocate legal authority between the national and European level in accordance with their respective capacity to 'do' justice; and it requires that we construct transnational ideas of solidarity that integrate the different elements into a single, coherent, ethics of justice. This thesis offers all three. It argues that the ethics of justice that is emerging in the European Union focuses on allowing its citizens to live a 'good life', which both requires access to the positive entitlements that emerge from the national welfare states and depends on the capacity of the free movement rights to enlarge the range of available choices for citizens in deciding how to live that life. The stability of this tiered conception of justice, however, presupposes the careful incorporation of the normative assumptions that bind and connect individual citizens in Europe within the reciprocal structures that sustain the national welfare state. This thesis suggests that transnational solidarity can serve as a device for such incorporation. The first part describes a theory of transnational solidarity that distinguishes between the rights that Union citizens accrue under market solidarity, communitarian solidarity, and aspirational solidarity. The bulk of the thesis offers a critical in-depth comparative analysis of the incorporation of the demands of transnational solidarity by the Union legislator and the Court of Justice within the particular context of healthcare, education, social security and social assistance, and labour law.",1687710912,,Dissertations & Theses," De Witte, FlorisDe WitteFlorisDe Witte, Floris",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3713032661 , 96792852 , 101309 , U638282 , U638282 , http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/452/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1687710912?accountid=14496, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, 0616 International law, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0616 International law, International law," http://etheses.lse.ac.uk/452/ , (UMI)AAIU638282 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Eu+law+and+the+question+of+justice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=De+Witte%2C+Floris&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Practising constructive resistance through autonomy and solidarity: the case of ya basta and solidarity trade in milan,"The thesis explores how European social movements have actively contested that there is no alternative to capitalism by constructing alternative trading practices in solidarity with marginalized peoples in the global South. The study adopts the example of the European Zapatista solidarity network (Redprozapa) to examine the nature of organizations involved in radical political practices. One organization Ya Basta-Milano is focused on to examine in detail the operation of, and challenges faced by, an autonomous political group that engages in solidarity trade. Solidarity and autonomy are the key conceptual themes, which the investigation revolves around. The research dwells upon the potential importance as well as the limitations of solidarity trade as an emerging form of constructive resistance. It concentrates upon the subject of autonomous spaces that embodies the physical and political context in which autonomous social movements promote their practices. It questions the contradictions met in this environment despite the romanticized idea promoted by some academic literature.

Based on ethnographic research throughout the Zapatista Other Campaign, this thesis looks at the process of building Zapatista solidarity. This research thus follows Zapatismo, looking at how nationalism is a way of talking and of thinking about belonging in ways that develop ‘real’ material structures of solidarity and recognition. It explores what happens to ‘the national’ in the consolidation of ‘neozapatismo’ – a social and political project imagined as an alternative to neoliberal globalisation. Much of the academic literature on alter-globalisation lacks a critical engagement with questions of nationalism and national identity preferring instead to focus on global connections, and how these produce new, radical and innovative social imaginings. By radicalising notions of ‘democracy, justice and liberty’ the Zapatistas are seen to exemplify the possibility of radical politics in their practice of autonomy. Through research carried out in multiple sites across Mexico, Los Angeles and New York City, this thesis looks at how autonomy is lived and experienced in the everyday. It explores some of the different discourses of and about the Zapatistas that have emerged, looking to understand some of the ways in which neozapatismo is mediated, identifying two key players: Subcomandante Marcos and ‘alternative’ media. This thesis addresses questions of how to re-think ‘the national’ in imaginings of alternative forms of globalisation that can translate into social and political action.",1779948322,,Dissertations & Theses," Gerson, YaelGersonYaelGerson, Yael",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017530261 , 94014902 , 101309 , 10047791 , 10047791 , http://research.gold.ac.uk/10459/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012,, English, English,,2012,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779948322?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://research.gold.ac.uk/10459/ , (UMI)AAI10047791 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%28un%29masking+neozapatismo%3A+a+multi-sited+ethnography+of+%27the+other+campaign%27&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gerson%2C+Yael&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Portraits of empowerment exhibited by One Million Signatures Campaign activists,"Iranian women have shown themselves to be anything but victims (Afkhami, 2009; Price, 1996; Shiranipour, 2002). Although they live in an oppressive regime (Nafisi, 1999; ""Symbolic annihilation,"" 1999), grassroots efforts of their One Million Signatures Campaign transformed gender politics in Iran (Khorasani, 2009). The Campaign has become international, and Iranian Americans have played a prominent role in furthering its message (Tohidi, 2010). Iranian women's struggles reflect the global phenomenon of women's movements (Ferree, 2006). Empowerment is used to conceptualize such movements, but few studies have explored individuals from the Middle East (e.g. Dufour &amp; Giraud, 2007). The present study addressed these deficiencies by recording the stories of eight activists of the One Million Signatures Campaign. My approach was influenced by personal experiences, my worldview, women's empowerment research, and literature on Iranian women's issues. I positioned myself in the research by explaining how parental influences, graduate school experiences, and an independent research project in Tehran led me to this study. I adopted the transformative worldview that science should be used to improve society (Mertens, 2008). I synthesized previous literature on women's empowerment and Iranian women. Procedures of the study followed that of portraiture design (Lawrence-Lightfoot &amp; Davis, 1997). Data collection included interviews, observations, and document review. I analyzed the data using systematic and interpretative techniques to develop three composite portraits. Each portrait represented two or three individuals. The first portrait was of Soheila, an artist whose self-confidence was apparent in every word and gesture. The second portrait was Paria, a warm individual who possessed a deep passion for understanding people. The individual in the third portrait, Dariush, possessed a genuineness and calm persistence that inspired me to act. Themes that emerged across portraits were (a) finding purpose in adversity, (b) the development of gender consciousness, (c) self-awareness, and (d) uncertainty. I discuss implications of the findings. I conclude with limitations, research directions, and strengths of this study.

To date, the growing political salience of non-state actors has been acknowledged but not assessed. In this dissertation, I argue that non-state actors can impact international processes to the extent that they are able to leverage other key actors, adopt coercive state tools, and build support from state actors. I refract the political practices of non-state actors through the lens of state capacity, yielding insights around shifting power dynamics in the international political landscape. I provide theoretical insight into how and when non-state actors matter—without inflating their role or claiming that states have somehow faded into the background. The 2003 conflict in the Darfur region of Sudan produced a mass humanitarian crisis that drew the attention of the international community. This dissertation is a case study of the Save Darfur Coalition, a US-based social movement that aimed to advance conflict resolution in Darfur by influencing the government of Sudan. I examine the Coalition's campaigns against indirect targets with leverage on the Sudanese government: multinational corporations, the African Union, the United States and China. The Coalition mimicked the traditional coercive tools of states—economic, military, and diplomacy—by pursuing strategies like divestment, support for peacekeeping operations, and public moral suasion. This adoption of state measures embodied a concept I call non-state statecraft, the art of conducting non-state affairs. As field research, I conducted 50 interviews with Save Darfur Coalition leadership, its international partners, activists, Sudan experts, security and human rights experts, and officials from the US Congress and the Department of State, China, and the United Nations.

The political, economic, and social structures and processes that emanate from Itaipú—""hydroelectric statecraft""—have resulted in a ""hydrostate"" model similar to but with important distinctions from petrostate formations. Moreover, these findings have implications beyond the energy politics of South America but for the development of renewable energy resources worldwide and global water management. Leftist former Bishop Fernando Lugo toppled the six-decade ruling Colorado Party in Paraguay in April 2008, linking popular discontent to one issue: Itaipú, the world's largest dam. In 2008 it supplied 19 percent of Brazil's electricity and 95 percent of Paraguay's and Paraguay ""ceded"" the vast majority of its electricity to Brazil for 1/10 th to 1/40 th of the price of that energy on the Brazilian market. Lugo's government promised to renegotiate this inequity and use the wealth for ""social development"" under the rubric of ""sovereignty."" This historical ethnography is drawn from unparalleled access to leaders in the government as they negotiated with Brazil and administered the dam, social movements as they mobilized for ""hydroelectric sovereignty,"" and archival evidence within Itaipú and the Stroessner-era secret police Archives of Terror. Section I begins with the dam's founding as an expression of the Stroessner military dictatorship's dominance over nature and nation, local and international causes for construction of the dam and how Itaipú enabled the growth of the Paraguayan state apparatus, including the surveillance-torture regime. Section II turns to Lugo's dramatic rise to the presidency, new negotiations with Brazil, and promises to fight corruption by instituting ""transparency."" Section III offers a behind-the-scenes glimpse into the patronage, rent-seeking, and networks of obligation that surround the dam. Section IV explores how the political economy of energy in the Southern Cone is recrafted under ""energy integration"" as well as the debates within Paraguay about how Itaipú's millions should be invested socially.",935993724,,Dissertations & Theses," Folch, ChristineFolchChristineFolch, Christine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2616606481 , 68147352 , 66569 , 9781267235398 , 3499235 , 3499235", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267235398, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/935993724?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0791 Energy"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0791 Energy"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0791 Energy",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0791 Energy"," Cultural anthropology , Latin American Studies , Energy"," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Hydroelectric , Itaipu Dam , Paraguay , Sovereignty",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+flows+of+sovereignty%3A+Itaip%C3%BA+hydroelectric+dam+and+the+ethnography+of+the+Paraguayan+nation-state&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Folch%2C+Christine&amp;isbn=9781267235398&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Impact of the Standards Movement on Creativity and Imagination as Perceived by Fine Arts Teachers,"As the nation's schools shift their focus toward annual standardized testing, there is concern that the skills of creativity and imagination are declining and students are not graduating with the necessary skills to create and innovate in this quickly changing global economy. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore the perceptions of fine arts teachers employed in a large urban district regarding the effect of the standards and testing movement on student creativity and imagination. Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences and Eisner's theories of the role of the arts in education provided the theoretical framework for the study. Research questions examined teacher's perceptions of creativity and imagination in the school environment, the curriculum, and their role in the inclusion of these skills. Data were gathered from 12 personal, in-depth interviews, and transcribed, coded, and categorized into major themes and subthemes during the analysis and interpretation stages of the study. Key findings indicated the majority of participants perceived the standards and testing movement as having a negative impact on creativity and imagination. Participants observed that the strong emphasis on standards and testing creates a rigid and overly structured teaching environment, leaving neither time nor flexibility for creative exploration.

I challenge the dominant interpretation that the politicization of the arts, and the privileging of political and class solidarity that marked this formative period of the Chinese Communist revolution led to the suppression of both femininity and female subjectivity under a masculine sign. First, I examine a range of literary works by leftist women activists and writers, to reveal the multiple meanings of not only political and class solidarity, but also of ""revolution"" itself, and how these identifications were expressed in relation to women's gendered consciousness. I show how leftist women writers narrated women's participation in new forms of public political expression, collective identification, and labor as means of discovery and re-cognition of the gendered self within the social. Second, I focus on the emergent genres of ""revolutionary literature"" emphasizing the role of art in reflecting reality and enacting social transformation that flourished in international leftist cultures, including in China, during this period. I argue that these forms, characterized by a documentary aesthetic and an emphasis on social experience, allowed women to challenge the dominant association of women's literary expression with narratives of private, sentimental or sexual experience. Furthermore, by tapping into the enduring expectation that women write as women, these politically activist narratives expanded the conceptions of femininity and ""women's experience"" in the popular imagination at large. Indeed, I consider the urban cultural arena in which stories of revolutionary women and genres revolutionary literature circulated together, especially through the media of left-affiliated women's journals and publishing houses in Shanghai. By bringing these investigations together, my dissertation sheds new light on women's actual and symbolic roles in a polyvalent and widely-appropriated leftist cultural and political imaginary during the formative decades of the Chinese revolution. The interventions by Chinese leftist women writers into the question of the intersections between gendered, political and classed subjectivities were the foundations of a ""revolutionary women's culture,"" which, I suggest, had lasting effects on the meanings of socialist femininity in Communist China.",955174847,,Dissertations & Theses," Grewal, AnupGrewalAnupGrewal, Anup",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2621159101 , 68263982 , 66569 , 9781267247179 , 3499730 , 3499730", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267247179, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/955174847?accountid=14496," 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies",," 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0453 Womens studies"," Asian literature , Asian Studies , Womens studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , China , Cultural movements , Culture , Femininity , Literature , Revolution , Women , Women writers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+revolutionary+women%27s+culture%3A+Rewriting+femininity+and+women%27s+experience+in+China%2C+1926%E2%80%931949&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grewal%2C+Anup&amp;isbn=9781267247179&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A literary history of the pastoral subject,"This dissertation studies the formation of a pastoral subject in early nineteenth-century England and India. It traces the pastoral subject position across two archival sites: first, a voluminous body of evangelical narratives produced by a Victorian Baptist mission to Orissa, a province on the east coast of colonial India. Second, a select set of fictional narratives of education produced by canonical Victorian authors, Sarah Stickney Ellis and Charlotte Bronte. I conceptualize the pastoral subject as a witness to certain moments of tension between two prominent forms of European disciplinary modernity: Christian pastoral and secular governmental. In their influential analyses, Charles Taylor and Michel Foucault track a history of co-operation between pastoral and governmental forms of disciplinary power in the constitution of the modern European social and political order in the long eighteenth-century. I extend the scope of these analyses by excavating a pastoral subject position that resists absorption into an increasingly governmentalized social and political body. The dissertation employs translation as a method of critical enquiry as well as a description of the process of subject formation. The pastoral subject achieves visibility when we reconstruct two historical processes of translation. First, the way in which the European discourse of disciplinary modernity is translated into non-European societies through the modern missionary movement. Second, the way in which the European discourse of disciplinary modernity is translated into European literary culture in the novel of education, especially those written by authors with evangelical sympathies. The pastoral subject is the locus of these translations. I cast the history of this subject position and the translations he lives with as a literary history that is transnational. The pastoral subject that emerges in the evangelical narratives produced by the Baptist mission—constitutional narratives, ethnological pamphlets, topological descriptions, autobiographies—is best reconstructed by a mode of literary historiography that constitutes a dialogue between metropolitan and colonial literary traditions. Read in conjunction with these colonial narratives, which were heavily in circulation in the Victorian evangelical public sphere, the works of Ellis and Bronte become visible as populated by pastoral subjects who exceed the metropole-colony dyad.",955178063,,Dissertations & Theses," Satpathy, SiddharthSatpathySiddharthSatpathy, Siddharth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2621184201 , 68264312 , 66569 , 9781267247742 , 3499766 , 3499766", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267247742, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/955178063?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0298 Modern literature , 0305 Asian literature , 0593 British and Irish literature , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Modern literature , Asian literature , British and Irish literature , South Asian Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Bronte, Charlotte , Ellis, Sarah Stickney , Evangelical narratives , India , Pastoral",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+literary+history+of+the+pastoral+subject&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Satpathy%2C+Siddharth&amp;isbn=9781267247742&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Tradition and Translation: Poetic Modernism in Beirut,"This dissertation presents a reading of modernism in Arabic poetry, a movement that flourished in Beirut between 1955 and 1975. It explores how the poets and theorists of this group, centered around the magazine Shi'r, redefined the parameters of Arabic poetry through their multiple projects of translation [naql], whether of foreign texts or classical predecessors. This redefinition involved a variety of literary and institutional strategies, whose common goal was to win for poetry a measure of autonomy from the region's rapidly metastasizing states. At a time when post-colonial Arab regimes sought to establish control over their respective national cultures, modernist poets fought to secure a margin of independence. By analyzing the theory and practice of modernism in poetry, this study shows how the Arabic literary field was restructured according to a new, globalized conception of the relations between culture and politics. The introduction lays out the historical context for this movement, arguing that it occurs at a moment of legitimation crisis for intellectuals across the Middle East. The first chapter narrates the movement's intellectual origins in the Social Syrian Nationalist Party. Looking at the life and writings of Yusuf al-Khal, editor-in-chief of Shi'r, it charts the modernists' move away from their political beginnings toward ideal of literary autonomy, mediated by the specifically Cold War figure of ""man."" Chapter two examines the Syrio-Lebanese poet Adonis' most important collection, The Songs of Mihyar the Damascene, arguing that its melancholic apostrophes are the symptoms of a turn away from nationalist politics toward an international space of exile. The third chapter examines debates about the Arabic prose poem, particularly as it was practiced by Unsi al-Hajj, the form's most radical advocate. It pays especially close attention to al-Hajj's encounter with Antoine Artaud, read as a figure for the impossibility of translation. The final two chapters center on Adonis' work as an anthologist and elegist, the ""internal translations"" by which he fundamentally reconfigured the canons of Arabic poetry. The conclusion suggests that Arabic modernism is, in historical terms, a late modernism, a movement whose emergence coincides with its own institutionalization.",992988836,,Dissertations & Theses," Creswell, RobynCreswellRobynCreswell, Robyn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2630027081 , 68474682 , 66569 , 9781267259813 , 3502685 , 3502685", Dissertation/Thesis, 2012, 9781267259813, English, English,,2012,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2012,https://search.proquest.com/docview/992988836?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0315 Middle Eastern literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0315 Middle Eastern literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0315 Middle Eastern literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0315 Middle Eastern literature"," Comparative literature , Middle Eastern literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Adonis , Anthology , Arabic , Arabic poetry , Beirut , Lebanon , Lebanon-literature , Modernism , Poetry , Translation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tradition+and+Translation%3A+Poetic+Modernism+in+Beirut&amp;issn=&amp;date=2012-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Creswell%2C+Robyn&amp;isbn=9781267259813&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""China's Forgotten Revolution: Radical Conservatism in Action, 1927-1949","This dissertation examines Republican China's state-led revolution under the Guomindang. Since the anti-Communist purge in 1927, the party-state had strived to re-energize mass activism and dissolve proletarian political subjectivity with a rightwing program that stressed interclass and national unity. Under Chiang Kai-shek's leadership, the Guomindang put an end to the ideological ambiguity of Sun Yat-sen's national revolution, broke ties the party forged with the Communist International in 1923, and launched an all-round assault on the fledging Chinese Communist Party. Refusing to challenge unequal power relationships domestically and abroad, Guomindang leaders promised to bring China and Asia back to their cultural essence and towards a superior ethical order. Despite its conservative socio-economic agenda, the party retained a radical organizational mode it derived from revolutionary socialism that prized Leninist vanguardism, reliance on mass involvement and cultural transformation. The Chinese nation-state under Guomindang rule experienced a conservative revolution and partook in a global fascist current that swept across Asia, Europe and Latin America during the second quarter of the twentieth century. The distinctiveness of China's conservative revolution is demonstrated in this dissertation through a multilayered study of its ideological formulations, mass mobilization programs, and ability to garner support from outside the Guomindang domestically and abroad. Senior party ideologues among radical conservatives, who produced tracts attacking the Guomindang's Communist allies in the mid-1920s, provided theoretical justifications for the April 1927 purge and heralded the party-state's drastic shift to the right. In the 1930s and 1940s, the Guomindang state deployed the scouting and wartime spiritual mobilization movements to re-channel mass activism towards strengthening the nation's organic unity and consolidating defense against Japanese invasion. Potentially subversive popular demands were diffused through a new focus on refining and rationalizing consumption habits, time management and other social mores. Instead of political participation, popular will found expression in public rituals, physical recreation and cultural entertainments. Conservative revolutionaries were adept in building elite support. The state's goal of disciplining everyday life converged with liberal intellectual fear over a social order collapsing under mob rule. While uncomfortable with some authoritarian behaviors on the Guomindang's part, prominent liberals such as Zhu Guangqian shared the state's priority of reining in an intransigent mass society. Internationally, China's repudiation of Soviet-supported anti-imperialist activities led the Guomindang to appeal to cultural affinities in the overtures it extended to the Indian independence movement. The regime's celebration of Eastern spiritual superiority proved attractive to Pan-Asianists like Rabindranath Tagore and informed exchanges between the Guomindang and Indian National Congress at the height of the Second World War. In highlighting the ascendency of radical conservatism in China and its transnational circulation across Asia, this dissertation sheds light on the distinct qualities, often downplayed in the historical literature, of the Guomindang's revolutionary enterprise vis-à-vis the radical left.",1271956595,,Dissertations & Theses," Tsui, Brian Kai HinTsuiKai HinBrianTsui, Brian Kai Hin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2871611991 , 74899092 , 66569 , 9781267818768 , 3547264 , 3547264", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781267818768, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1271956595?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies",," 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies"," History , Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Communism , Conservative revolution , Everyday life , Guomindang , India , Mass mobilization , Radical conservatism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=China%27s+Forgotten+Revolution%3A+Radical+Conservatism+in+Action%2C+1927-1949&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tsui%2C+Brian+Kai+Hin&amp;isbn=9781267818768&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Envisioned communities: African American life and the moving pictures, 1896–1927","This dissertation investigates the role of cinema in the modern black experience and the generative role that African Americans played in the creation of American modernity. Two questions animate this study. First, how did African Americans consolidate their institutions and social bonds amid the distending forces of turn-of-the-century migration? Second, how and why did cinema—as a location, medium, and set of practices—become so important to the collective articulation of black identity in the early twentieth century? By mapping the patterns of turn-of-the-century migration with the development of black cinema practices from 1896 to 1927, this project traces black economic, social, and cultural practices across space and time. It begins in the post-Reconstruction period, when African Americans looked inward to fortifying the institutions that stood at the center of black life. Yet at the same time, hundreds of thousands of black migrants were departing the countryside for the urban South and West. At this curious juncture when black life was both turning inward and expanding outward, African Americans used film as a tool for collective racial progress. Black churches, halls, and schools hosted moving picture exhibitions, which brought the race together and raised money for the construction of buildings that conspicuously demonstrated black material progress. Eventually black film exhibition moved into colored theaters, which became celebrated monuments of black life and public claims to urban space in the Jim Crow city. During this time, African Americans associated race and cinema primarily with tangible, physical locations. Yet when colored theaters started to compete with black religious institutions, middle class blacks were forced to reconsider the ideas of racial uplift, which championed both piety and black-owned businesses. After 1910, a series of events—including Jack Johnson’s victory as heavyweight champion of the world—further shifted the focus from the exhibition site to the screen. Black conceptions of freedom and natural rights based on new sensibilities of racial representation informed the first mass protest movement of African Americans in the twentieth century as well as transnational formations of racial identity articulated by the race film industry.",1283100316,,Dissertations & Theses," Caddoo, CaraCaddooCaraCaddoo, Cara",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2879607441 , 75064602 , 66569 , 9781267851475 , 3549040 , 3549040", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781267851475, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1283100316?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0900 Film studies"," African American Studies , Black history , American history , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Black church , Black institutional life , Cinema , Leisure , Migration , Visual culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Envisioned+communities%3A+African+American+life+and+the+moving+pictures%2C+1896%E2%80%931927&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Caddoo%2C+Cara&amp;isbn=9781267851475&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Language in the Mirror: Language Ideologies, Schooling and Islam in Qatar","My study explores language ideologies in the capital city of Doha, Qatar, where school reform movements are placing greater emphasis on English language acquisition. Through ethnography and a revised theory of language ideologies, I argue that as languages come in greater contact in multi-lingual spaces, mediation must occur between the new and old relationships that are emerging as a result of population growth, policy changes and cross-cultural interactions. I interrogate the development concept of the ""knowledge economy"" as it is used to justify old and new language ideologies regarding Arabic and English. As Qataris change their education systems in response to the economic development framework of the ""knowledge economy,"" they are promoting language ideologies that designate English as useful for the economy and ""global"" citizenship and Qatari Arabic and Standard Arabic as useful for religious and cultural reasons. I argue that Standard English, through its association with the ""knowledge economy,"" becomes ""de-localized"" and branded an ""international"" language. This ideology presents English as a modern language free of the society in which it is embedded, to circulate around the globe. In contrast, Standard Arabic is represented as stiff, archaic language of religious traditions and Qatari Arabic is presented as the language of oral culture and ethnonationalism. These findings counter the arguments of scholars who have viewed Arabic's linguistic diversity as a binary of written religious tradition and spoken dialects. I argue that scholars have ignored the metapragmatic analysis of Arabic speakers, who view both Standard Arabic and their regional dialects as one language that needs to be defended against the encroachment of foreign languages. In chapter one, I explore the history of Qatar through narrative accounts of western historians and Qatari oral and written accounts. I reflect upon the efforts of the current Qatari leaderships to connect with narratives of globalization through the framework of the ""knowledge economy."" In chapter two, I outline the actor-networks of the ""knowledge economy"" that create a development hierarchy between English, the language of the de-localized ""international"" citizen, and Arabic, the language of the ""local"" Qatari. In chapter three, I trace how privatization of schooling affects Arabic teachers and their defense of the value of Arabic through an ideology of ""Arabic is the language of the Quran."" In the following chapter, I move to sites of higher education, where orality and literacy of Arabic are disputed by Arabic teachers, Qatari students and non-Qatari students of Arabic. I contend that studying language through the speech community reduces the tendency to see language variability as problematic or a sign of language death. In chapter five, I explore the role of Islam in Arabic language ideologies by juxtaposing discourses of the secular and of religious tradition. While some scholars have argued that Arabic speakers do not fully understand the implications of Arabic's connection to Islam, my work indicates that speakers are fully aware of this relationship and when necessary, utilize it discursively to promote various political, social and cultural agendas. In conclusion, I argue that a methodology of actor-network theory has allowed me to write a situated ethnography of globalizing processes. The tracing of actor-networks is ideal for studying the rapid changes in Qatar and the ways in which immense wealth has brought many different types of individuals into the country to create new models of schooling and education. Rather than placing the focus on ""international"" discourses, knowledge economies and globalization, my ethnography emphasizes the need for situated accounting that combines the metalanguage of academics, policy makers and leaders with those of the individuals affected by reforms and projects of globalization.",1317665236,,Dissertations & Theses," Asmi, RehenumaAsmiRehenumaAsmi, Rehenuma",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2920346741 , 76387392 , 66569 , 9781267952653 , 3554763 , 3554763", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781267952653, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1317665236?accountid=14496," 0291 Modern language , 0318 Religion , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0291 Modern language , 0318 Religion , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0291 Modern language , 0318 Religion , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies",," 0291 Modern language , 0318 Religion , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," Modern language , Religion , English as a Second Language , Middle Eastern Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Education , Ethnography , Gulf studies , Islam , Language ideologies , Qatar",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Language+in+the+Mirror%3A+Language+Ideologies%2C+Schooling+and+Islam+in+Qatar&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Asmi%2C+Rehenuma&amp;isbn=9781267952653&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Winter in America: A Cultural History of the Rise of Neoliberalism, 1960s-1980s","""Winter in America"" explores the interactions between culture and economics related to the rise of neoliberalism in the United States between the 1960s and 1980s, and within the context of the processes of modernity (formed through the nexus of colonialism/imperialism, capitalism, slavery, and nationalism). Using the prism of the longue durée, this dissertation highlights the intersectional antagonisms characterizing the 1960s culture wars and their manifestation across popular culture and media. In particular, if focuses on the ways in which new, reconfigured formations of blackness and whiteness appeared within the changing American political economy that emerged in the late 1970s as neoliberalism. ""Winter in America"" weaves the longue durée challenges of the Civil Rights and Women's Liberation movement to white masculinity into the fabric of the corporate multinational and finance counterrevolution against the Welfare state that took place in the 1970s. Rather than viewing the late 1960s and 1970s white masculine backlash as a simple reaction against 1960s social movements, ""Winter in America"" ties these structures of feeling to deeper core elements of cultural-economic forms anchored to the evolving processes of modernity as it entered the neoliberal stage of global capitalism. Forming an interdisciplinary framework to view the post-Civil Rights, post-Welfare state United States, ""Winter in America"" draws together the historiographies of Civil Rights and Black Power, the New Right, Second Wave Feminism, Business History, Film and Media studies, and Critical Race Theory. Indeed, much of the rhetorical fabric supporting the corporate counterrevolution in the 1970s aimed toward reconstructing and reorienting the American political economy in a way that incorporated the moderate reforms of the Civil Rights-Black Power movement and Second Wave Feminism—colorblindness and gender-neutrality—while not fully relinquishing the processes of modernity related to anti-blackness and misogyny. Centered on various case studies of popular culture (film, music, television, and news magazines) that either explicitly or implicitly commented on the intersections of economics and culture, ""Winter in America"" helps provide a framework for better understanding the cultural logic of the rise of neoliberalism within the larger project of modernity.",1324471047,,Dissertations & Theses," McClure, Daniel RobertMcClureRobertDanielMcClure, Daniel Robert",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2938898231 , 75024922 , 66569 , 9781267984333 , 3556427 , 3556427", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781267984333, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1324471047?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history",," 0296 African American Studies , 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history"," African American Studies , American history , Economic history"," Social sciences , Business history , Cultural studies , Modernity , Neoliberalism , Popular culture , Post-civil rights era",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Winter+in+America%3A+A+Cultural+History+of+the+Rise+of+Neoliberalism%2C+1960s-1980s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McClure%2C+Daniel+Robert&amp;isbn=9781267984333&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Righteous and the Profane: Performing a Punk Solidarity in Mexico City,"Mexico City’s punk scene has a notorious reputation, based on the supposedly angry, rude, and destructive behavior of its integrants. Certainly, participants in the punk scene value intense affects, aesthetics, and interpersonal exchange, but see them as means to amplify their political consciousness, their attempts to create alternative social networks. In this dissertation thesis, based on an extended period of ethnographic fieldwork in Mexico City’s punk scene, I investigate the co-constitution of the aesthetic and political for participants of the punk scene and ask what “the political” might entail for the city’s marginalized punk youth. In pursuing a local punk aesthetics that is both righteous and profane, to borrow descriptive terminology from Dick Hebdige, I argue for close formal analysis of musical, artistic, and other social performance. I employ formal analysis to evaluate the flourishing of punk in the context of “el DeFectuoso”—as residents name the hard-scrabble, global South metropolis of Mexico City—decades after punk’s initial arrival in Mexico. Deleuzian network theory and social movement theory more broadly help me argue for a politically constituted music “scene,” created largely through U.S.-Mexico cross-border relations, without fixing its boundaries or stultifying its politics. Additionally, I explore the affective dimensions of punk performance, the role of music in subjectivization, and the importance of the body trained intersubjectively for both listening and performing. It is at the points of convergence of these three approaches that I locate a punk aesthetics as at once a punk ethics, animated by an ideal of “direct action.” Within chapters organized through broad themes like networks, violence, labor, and solidarity, I address topics from the harsh, hard-working vocal performances punks employ to the various anarchist currents that shape an always-tenuous, specifically Mexican punk solidarity, constituted through practices like street sing-alongs, the creation of alternative DIY networks of exchange, and fanzine writing and design. Within these routes of investigation, I elucidate the ways in which participants in Mexico City’s punk scene use profanity and outrage in the performance of a righteous ethic that informs their struggles to maintain solidarity and make a difference, through an explicitly political social network that is nevertheless grounded in aesthetic experience.",1353193333,,Dissertations & Theses," Tatro, KelleyTatroKelleyTatro, Kelley",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2974786921 , 77578882 , 66569 , 9781303041006 , 3559136 , 3559136", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303041006, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1353193333?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Music , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Ethnomusicology , Labor , Mexico City , Punk , Solidarity , Violence , Voice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Righteous+and+the+Profane%3A+Performing+a+Punk+Solidarity+in+Mexico+City&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tatro%2C+Kelley&amp;isbn=9781303041006&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"What only heaven hears: Citizens and the state in the wake of HIV scale-up in Lesotho,"This dissertation poses a set of questions about the political impacts of the rapid and large–scale deployment of HIV programs (HIV “scale–up”) in Lesotho. As HIV and global health initiatives have expanded over the past decade, they have had sociopolitical, as well as epidemiological, impacts. In particular, HIV scale–up elicited and demanded new political processes that continue to change how policy is crafted, how citizens are represented, and which values drive new health initiatives. More fundamentally, HIV initiatives have altered the ways that citizens, patients, and communities perceive themselves, the state, and their political worlds. Utilizing multi–sited ethnographic methods, this project observes how citizens in Lesotho are coping with these dramatic changes in their political worlds. The research reveals HIV scale–up’s considerable and far–reaching impacts on citizen faith in democracy, perceptions of rights, access to key social protections, and feelings of belonging. In contrast to work on the impacts of social movements, activism, and political will on HIV policies, this dissertation inverts the causal direction of inquiry regarding health and politics. In doing so, it recognizes new global health movements as drivers of political change, mobilizing actors and resources in deploying programs in ways that are altering political worlds and subjectivities. A rich recent literature on biological and therapeutic citizenship in the time of AIDS has begun recognizing these trends and their impacts on patient subjectivity. This research expands the frame of inquiry to examine how public health interventions can also alter citizen subjectivity, expectations of democracy, and the structures of associational life. The dissertation also contributes data towards better understandings of recipient populations’ perspectives on accountability, good governance, public–private partnerships, transparency, and participation—approaches currently touted as solutions to poor project outcomes. For citizens in Lesotho, these initiatives still look very much like anti–democratic enterprises. Field research was undertaken in two sites surrounding different clinical care models: the first was a government–run primary care clinic, and the second was a factory–based clinic in the country's garment industry, where a public–private partnership provided HIV services to workers. In both sites, research extended far beyond the clinic. In the former site, this meant working with: peri–urban communities served by the clinic; two support groups struggling to build partnerships with NGOs; local government institutions tasked with managing the HIV response; and traditional healers, community health workers, and patients giving and seeking care outside the clinic. In the second site, this meant exploring dynamics of discipline, productivity and “ethical” production in a transtnationally–linked industry, as well as the social lives of workers outside their work. Though largely unforeseen by most global health actors, HIV policy has become an extremely effective delivery mechanism for specific political ideologies and ways of practicing politics in poor countries. Research conducted in these sites demonstrates that the expansive, far–reaching scale–up of HIV programs has fundamentally changed ideas about what citizens deserve, who is deserving, how decisions will be made about services, and who takes responsibility for services, and ultimately, the survival of citizens. The predominant experience of politics for most citizens in post–scale–up Lesotho is a feeling of abandonment, of not being heard. The research thus raises significant normative as well as pragmatic questions about the role and responsibility of global health projects in already fragile political systems, and the potential impacts of the political changes described here on patterns of health seeking and ill health in countries like Lesotho.",1356848238,,Dissertations & Theses," Kenworthy, Nora J.KenworthyJ.NoraKenworthy, Nora J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2983564531 , 79225872 , 66569 , 9781303066146 , 3560533 , 3560533", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303066146, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1356848238?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0344 Social research , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy"," 0293 African Studies , 0344 Social research , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy"," 0293 African Studies , 0344 Social research , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy",," 0293 African Studies , 0344 Social research , 0573 Public health , 0630 Public policy"," African Studies , Social research , Public health , Public policy"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Africa , Citizenship , Democracy , Global health , HIV/AIDS , Lesotho",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=What+only+heaven+hears%3A%0ACitizens+and+the+state+in+the+wake+of+HIV+scale-up+in+Lesotho&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kenworthy%2C+Nora+J.&amp;isbn=9781303066146&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Vatican and the Making of the Atlantic Order, 1920–1960","Historians have traditionally paid little attention to the influence of institutional Catholicism in shaping the international state system in the twentieth century. This dissertation argues that the Vatican played a crucial role in facilitating the rise of anti-liberal and anti-socialist political movements after World War I, and in laying the foundations for the emergence of the Cold War Atlantic Order after 1945. Following its loss of the Papal States in 1870, the Vatican fought to regain influence on the European continent by pioneering a new form of treaty diplomacy and by launching a transnational anticommunist campaign with broad appeal. These actions enabled the Vatican to seize a prominent place in European affairs, and integrate elements of its vision of state-society relations within the legal, economic and social framework of nearly a dozen European states. The Vatican's interwar gains led it to partner during World War II with the United States and Christian Democratic leaders, forging an alliance that would contribute decisively to Europe's moral and material reconstruction, and shape the emergent Cold War Atlantic alliance.",1357151664,,Dissertations & Theses," Chamedes, GiulianaChamedesGiulianaChamedes, Giuliana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2984430751 , 79244872 , 66569 , 9781303068904 , 3560636 , 3560636", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303068904, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1357151664?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history",," 0320 Religious history , 0335 European history , 0337 American history"," Religious history , European history , American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Catholicism , Communism , Europe , Philosophy , Religion and theology , United States , Vatican",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Vatican+and+the+Making+of+the+Atlantic+Order%2C+1920%E2%80%931960&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chamedes%2C+Giuliana&amp;isbn=9781303068904&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The mountaintop vision: Martin Luther King's cosmology of connection,"This dissertation asserts that Martin Luther King Jr.'s social justice vision was based on a worldview of interconnection. This work examines cosmological and ecological dimensions of King's thought that have been largely overlooked in previous King scholarship. King's vision connected racism with war and poverty, stressed the unity of peoples and movements around the planet, and recognized the interwoven nature of the universe, which he described as ""the interrelated structure of all reality"" (King 1968g, 70). His holistic view of the cosmos and society is the hallmark of what I call his Mountaintop Vision. This work places King's environmental statements within the context of the ecological awakenings of the 1960s, and within the traditions of holistic and ecological thought stretching from indigenous and African worldviews, through the Romantics, and early ecological voices such as Thoreau, Whitman, Carver, Leopold, and Carson. His ecological concerns both reflected his moment and anticipated many of the developments of the following decades. King's cosmology is placed within the cosmological revolutions of twentieth-century science and the discovery of the expanding universe. King rejected the materialism of twentieth-century science while also appreciating its discoveries and the grandeur of what he referred to as the ""stars, planets, meteors, comets. All this galaxy of wonders"" (King n.d., ""Paint [2]""). In the last years of his life, which I call his Mountaintop Period (1966–68), King identified systemic links between social justice issues that were largely viewed as separate, fusing them into a unified critique that fundamentally challenged the modern system. This work articulates six aspects of King's Mountaintop Vision: (1) connecting justice to the cosmos, (2) emphasizing economic justice, (3) confronting systemic racism, (4) challenging US militarism, (5) exemplifying the prophetic path, and (6) building a global movement. King's worldview constituted a cosmology of justice in which interdependence and compassion are woven into the fabric of the cosmos itself. In King's view, ""the universe is on the side of justice"" (Ayres 1993, 225). This dissertation examines King's speeches, sermons, and writings to demonstrate his vision of radical connection. I argue that King's view of existence as a ""network of mutuality,"" in which ""all life is interrelated"" (King 1968g, 69), should be recognized as an early expression of a socially aware, politically engaged systems thinking and ecological consciousness. King's Mountaintop Vision linked social justice, cosmology, and ecology in a way that may yet provide guidance for our future.",1362257891,,Dissertations & Theses," Dellinger, DrewDellingerDrewDellinger, Drew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2986112531 , 78948312 , 66569 , 9781303076862 , 3560922 , 3560922", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303076862, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1362257891?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy"," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy"," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy",," 0296 African American Studies , 0325 Black studies , 0392 Environmental philosophy , 0422 Philosophy"," African American Studies , Black studies , Environmental philosophy , Philosophy"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Civil rights movement , Cosmology , Ecology , Environmentalism , King, Martin Luther, Jr.",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+mountaintop+vision%3A+Martin+Luther+King%27s+cosmology+of+connection&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dellinger%2C+Drew&amp;isbn=9781303076862&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Playing the Crowd: Mass Pageantry in Europe and the United States, 1905-1935","This dissertation brings to light a theatrical and political genre I call ""mass pageantry,"" which emerged in England, the United States, Russia and Germany during the early twentieth century. Performed out-of-doors, often with thousands of amateur local performers in costume, these vast mytho-historical spectacles emerged from unusual alliances between playwrights and directors seeking to transform theater as a cultural practice, and political organizations seeking new ways to gain the allegiance of the working classes. Because mass pageants arose in significantly different political contexts, they have been primarily discussed in single-nation studies by historians of culture and politics. This trend has inadvertently led to a general neglect of their status as theatrical events and to a false distinction between American and British ""pageants,"" which are frequently dismissed as nostalgia, and Soviet and German ""spectacles,"" which are often reduced to propaganda. This dissertation demonstrates that despite significant differences in the political impulses behind these events, they together represent a complex and imaginative transnational theatrical genre defined by shared techniques and a common purpose. It argues that the emergence of mass pageantry points to a shared cultural goal—to reinvent theater as an art form created for and by ""the people""—as well to a common social problem for which pageants were seen as a promising solution: how to reconstitute ""peoples"" from the ""crowds"" produced by mass culture, industrialization and political upheaval. Chapter One locates the emergence of mass pageantry at the intersection of two nineteenth-century intellectual currents: the development of ""crowd theory"" and the growth of people's theater movements. Chapters Two, Three and Four each focus on a single pageant: The Sherborne Pageant (England, 1908), written and directed by Louis Napoleon Parker; The Masque of St. Louis (US, 1914), written by Percy MacKaye; and Towards a World Commune (RSFSR, 1920), created by a team of five directors. To demonstrate the ways in which mass pageants competed with one another for the attention of audiences, as well as how theories and techniques of mass pageantry were adapted for a new medium, Chapter Five surveys mass pageants of the Weimar period in Germany and examines Leni Riefenstahl's 1935 film, Triumph of the Will , through the lens of mass pageantry. This dissertation demonstrates that pageant-devisers, influenced as often by transnational artistic movements and socio-theatrical reform efforts as by the political agenda of pageant sponsors, generated their own visions of collective life through the mass pageants they created. Although their ideas were in varying degrees informed by theories emerging from the burgeoning field of ""crowd theory,"" I argue that pageants are best understood as contributing performative ideas of their own making to an ongoing debate rather than as stagings of crowd theories already in existence. Together they articulate a consensus about the role theater can and should play in the representation and transformation of actual crowds, and by extension, in the transformation of social life and culture more broadly.",1364612096,,Dissertations & Theses," Stokes, ShilarnaStokesShilarnaStokes, Shilarna",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 2987167121 , 75085442 , 66569 , 9781303088551 , 3561647 , 3561647", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303088551, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1364612096?accountid=14496," 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts , 0644 Theater History"," 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts , 0644 Theater History"," 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts , 0644 Theater History",," 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts , 0644 Theater History"," Theater , Performing Arts , Theater History"," Communication and the arts , Crowd theory , Mass pageants , Pageants , Spectacle , Theater",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Playing+the+Crowd%3A+Mass+Pageantry+in+Europe+and+the+United+States%2C+1905-1935&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stokes%2C+Shilarna&amp;isbn=9781303088551&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Organizing business for sustainability: Learning in an emerging field of practice,"All too often conversations about education and learning assume that we know what learning is, how it happens, and to what ends the process should be directed.

Initially misunderstood as a faddish form of Black male musical expression, Hip-hop's cultural resistance practices were quickly recognized as four core elements (emceeing, turntablism, graffiti art, and b-boying/b-girling). In the global context, Hip-hop has generated scholarly discourse that points to either the cultural globalization of American Blackness or a ""global village."" My project interrupts this conversation and focuses on the unique, multi-site cultural history of Filipino identity as constituted through practitioners of Hip-Hop dance. My work argues that a community of Filipinos, situated in different geo-political loci—Berkeley, California, Honolulu, Hawai`i, and Manila, Philippines—configure prevailing concepts of Hip-hop while remaking conditions of dispossession and displacement in the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries. My study advances its argument through a theorization of remaking comprised of three broad themes—Hip-hop dance is part of a repertoire for Filipino race relations; decolonization is tied to Hip-hop's institutionalization; and dance offers an alternative perspective of Hip-hop's globalization. Using ethnography and choreographic analysis, I conduct close readings of select dances, dance events, and dancers in order to offer innovative views into the politics of race and culture. Specifically, I analyze the ways Filipinos in Berkeley remake the dominant racial paradigms of liberal multiculturalism and colorblindness with counter-hegemonic history and politics; Honolulu-based Filipinos create spaces for decolonization; and Filipinos in Manila rework the grammar of American neocolonialism to access otherwise proscribed spaces of gender and dance. Informed by fields of critical race studies, postcolonial studies, and performance studies, my dissertation uncovers the often neglected choreography of Filipinos to complement these fields and assert a practice-based approach to understanding global Hip-hop as a strategy for equality and social justice.",1372812905,,Dissertations & Theses," Perillo, Jeffrey LorenzoPerilloLorenzoJeffreyPerillo, Jeffrey Lorenzo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3009179521 , 80208932 , 66569 , 9781303102363 , 3562543 , 3562543", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303102363, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1372812905?accountid=14496," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0378 Dance"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0378 Dance"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0378 Dance",," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0378 Dance"," Asian American Studies , Dance"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Critical dance studies , Critical race studies , Filipino subjectivity , Globalization , Hip-hop dance , Postcolonialism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hip-hop%2C+Streetdance%2C+and+the+Remaking+of+the+Global+Filipino&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perillo%2C+Jeffrey+Lorenzo&amp;isbn=9781303102363&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Moving Cataclysm: Journeys of Quest, Landscapes of Loss in Late French Medieval Romance and 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt;-Century Travel Narratives","This dissertation examines the relationship between human movement, social processes, and changing landscapes in 12 th -13 th -century French romance ( roman de quête ) and early to mid-19 th -century French travel narratives and romans d'ailleurs . The intentional journey, which we can apply to secular as well as to spiritual goals of both medieval heroes and Romantic journeyers, connotes a place of juncture in an individual life that seeks resolution through movement, through return to origins, and through alignment with ongoing human processes and the processes of history. How narratives of traversal of natural and lived spaces assign meaning to both traveler and place and how humans construct themselves and attempt to re-order their universes by intentional journeying comprise the focal concerns of this study. The term cataclysm refers to any sudden, violent change, whether local, global, or in one's perception of the universe. Late medieval quest, initially a prescribed practice designed to re-educate the wayward knight for service to society, emerges as a complex response to natural and social degradation, associated with incompatible, yet co-existing, moral discourses, forces of progress, and progressively mechanized human identity. As Ken Hiltner puts it, environmental consciousness occurs when one becomes ""thematically aware"" of one's environment ""at the moment of its withdrawal"" ( What Else is Pastoral 38). 19 th century travelers, for whom pilgrimage into unknown and ""exotic"" territories often accompanies social or political exile, attempt to mediate between the multiple dimensions of being and being French in relationship to post-Revolutionary France. Whether from the vantage point of Chrétien de Troyes, 13 th -century prose adaptations of the Arthurian legend, or early-to-mid-19 th century reflections of Chateaubriand, Lamartine, Nerval, texts from each period grapple with codified and re-imagined scenarios of encounter between individuals, unknown wildernesses, and the lost local: their authors articulate perceived threats, document uncertainty, and seek resolution through projects of self-renewal. Whether as pilgrims, exiles, or flâneurs , the landscapes within which these travelers wander loom with an aura of impending eclipse that, nevertheless, never entirely loses hope of régénérescence .

Engineers, as gatekeepers of technological innovation, confront increasingly complex world issues ranging from economic and social to political and environmental. Recently, a multitude of government reports have argued that solving such complex problems requires changes in the pedagogy of engineering education, such as that prescribed by the Science, Technology, Society, and education (STS) movement that grew out of the environmental movement in the 70s. In STS students are engaged in the community by understanding that scientific progress is innately a sociopolitical process that involves dimensions of power, wealth and responsibility. United States accreditation criteria now demand ""the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context"" (ABET Engineering Accreditation Commission 2005). With such emphasis on STS education as necessary to address complex world issues, it is vital to assess the barriers in the traditional engineering curriculum that may inhibit the success of such educational reform. This study identifies barriers to STS goals and pedagogy in post secondary science education by using the Francis College of Engineering at UMASS Lowell as a single case study. The study draws on existing literature to develop a theoretical framework for assessing four hypothesized barriers to STS education in undergraduate engineering. Identification of barriers to STS education in engineering generates a critical reflection of post secondary science education and its role in preparing engineers to be active citizens in shaping a rapidly globalizing world. The study offers policy recommendations for enabling post secondary science education to incorporate STS education into its curriculum.",1398870188,,Dissertations & Theses," Phaneuf, TiffanyPhaneufTiffanyPhaneuf, Tiffany",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3015227511 , 80343952 , 66569 , 9781303148897 , 1522930 , 1522930", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303148897, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1398870188?accountid=14496," 0640 Sustainability , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education"," 0640 Sustainability , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education"," 0640 Sustainability , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education",," 0640 Sustainability , 0714 Science education , 0745 Higher education"," Sustainability , Science education , Higher education"," Social sciences , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Identifying+barriers+to+Science%2C+Technology%2C+Society+and+environment+%28STSE%29+educational+goals+and+pedagogy+in+science+education%3A++A+case+study+of+UMASS+Lowell+undergraduate+engineering&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Phaneuf%2C+Tiffany&amp;isbn=9781303148897&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Peterborough Young Women's Christian Association: Fundraising and feminism—1960–1983,"The history of fundraising within the Peterborough Young Women's Christian Association, from 1960 to 1983, is a critical but neglected theme for understanding the history of this organization and its relation to feminism, charity and the state. The YWCA movement in Canada, including Peterborough, pioneered two kinds of successful fundraising: episodic capital campaigns and a user pay model of funding meaning clients paid to stay in YWCA'S residence and for the programs they attended. The Peterborough YWCA also created a new fundraising venture using a social entrepreneurship 1 model called Y's Buys which sold donated clothes. Capital campaigns were used to build the original 1904 Peterborough YWCA building, the new pool in 1918 and to upgrade the pool in .the 1939. During 1941, the YWCA joined the Community Chest movement, and by 1960 this stream provided 30% of the operating revenue for the organization. However, starting in the 1960s the middle-class board members' notions of race, class and gender created a mission drift. This mission drift slowly destabilized their fundraising models because the board members became hostile and patronizing to the very clients who provided the majority of the fundraising revenue – poor single women with few resources or supports. Instead, the board's efforts were focused on providing paid programs that suited their middle class sensibilities. As well, because of their view of their clients, the board failed to create a fundraising program to sustain the original building because the capital repairs and government mandated fire safety improvements were very costly. At the moment of impending financial collapse, a local group of second-wave feminists took over the governance of the YWCA. This group of new board members were primarily from the Peterborough Women's Committee, a small state-funded group of women created around the local International Women's Year organizing committee. These board members had their own ideas about fundraising, and stated that their aims were to return to the ideological roots of the YWCA and be of service to women. The women they wanted to serve were already using the YWCA residence as a last refuge. As they evolved the mission, the new YWCA board members cancelled the old program models and focused on creating a women's shelter and a crisis house for single women. They achieved this by using several fundraising approaches. By engaging in an archival analysis of the Peterborough YWCA fonds from 1957 – 1984, the Peterborough Women's Committee fonds from 1979 – 1987, and through two oral interviews with past board members, this thesis demonstrates the transformation of the YWCA's mission and focus through their fundraising activities. 1 Recent studies about Social Entrepreneurship include the 2012 book Social Entrepreneurship: Theory and Practice by Ryszard Praszkier and Andrzej Nowak, or the 2006 Social Entrepreneurship by Johanna Mair, et al. Many scholars have recently started to write about the idea after the world wide success of using micro loans to help women escape poverty. In Peterborough the YWCA created a project to sell used clothing for profit and the profits helped to fund the operations of the YWCA. The Junior League was training women about for-profit-business in the 1970s and the YWCA board had training from the organization to start their venture.",1399385869,,Dissertations & Theses," Hannam, NeilHannamNeilHannam, Neil",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3017148051 , 80384132 , 66569 , 9780494938478 , MR93847 , MR93847", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9780494938478, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1399385869?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0385 Canadian studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0617 Public administration"," 0334 Canadian history , 0385 Canadian studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0617 Public administration"," 0334 Canadian history , 0385 Canadian studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0617 Public administration",," 0334 Canadian history , 0385 Canadian studies , 0453 Womens studies , 0617 Public administration"," Canadian history , Canadian studies , Womens studies , Public administration"," Social sciences , Ontario",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Peterborough+Young+Women%27s+Christian+Association%3A+Fundraising+and+feminism%E2%80%941960%E2%80%931983&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hannam%2C+Neil&amp;isbn=9780494938478&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""To avoid the unimaginable"": Neoliberalism and the struggle for American democracy since the 1960s","This study explores the structural, tactical, and strategic legacies of 1960s era activism on subsequent American social movements.

Indeed, by the end of the century, such changes had helped precipitate the closing of the frontier, the United States' emergence onto the international scene as a major imperialist power, and the rise of the populist movement, which climaxed in the great realigning Presidential election of 1896. The last of these was particularly significant in that it was arguably the first large-scale attempt to seriously address the various problems created by the rapid urbanization and industrialization of the late nineteenth century and would moreover serve as the prelude to a much larger and more fundamental awakening in American political life, that vast tangle of reforms and prescriptions which beggars all generalization, best known to us today as the progressive movement. In the quarter century to follow, the three greatest leaders of this movement at the national level, William Jennings Bryan, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson each articulated a distinct conception of or approach toward reform, inspiring and antagonizing each other in ways which significantly shaped both the thought and action of the progressive era. This interaction between the three men and the ideas they espoused can be understood as following a roughly dialectical pattern, with Bryan's agrarian and insurgent brand of reform functioning as the thesis, Roosevelt's more patrician and paternalistic approach as the antithesis, and Wilson and his New Freedom as a sort of synthesis of the two. By more closely examining the careers, public statements, and political convictions of these three archetypal figures, we may be able to better understand the origin, development, and effects of this political dialectic not only within its own time, but throughout the following century, leading down to our own day.",1412677769,,Dissertations & Theses," Vigil, Brett EdwardVigilEdwardBrettVigil, Brett Edward",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3029139731 , 80601792 , 66569 , 9781303148316 , 1539462 , 1539462", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303148316, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1412677769?accountid=14496, 0337 American history, 0337 American history, 0337 American history,, 0337 American history, American history," Social sciences , Bryan , Progressivism , Roosevelt , Wilson",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Propositions+for+reform%3A+The+dialectical+politics+of+the+progressive+era&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vigil%2C+Brett+Edward&amp;isbn=9781303148316&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Pain, Pride, and Politics: Social Movement Activism and the Sri Lankan Tamil Diaspora in Canada","As the civil war came to a close in Sri Lanka in May 2009, and as many members of the Tamil diaspora took to the streets in month-long demonstrations in Toronto, Ottawa, London, Paris and elsewhere, it struck me that with the defeat of the LTTE it would be important to begin understanding how the diaspora in Canada (home to the largest Sri Lankan Tamil population outside of Sri Lanka itself) and around the world would react and respond. It was in many ways an opportune time to study the ways in which a diaspora community may transition from ""supporting"" a socio-political movement in their country of origin to becoming a social movement in their own right. It also became clear that government officials and commentators in the media, accustomed to viewing the Canadian Tamil diaspora as fundamentally ""corrosive"" and, indeed, a possible security threat within their own borders, were somewhat confused about what the defeat of the LTTE would mean for Tamils in Canada. While the activities of the LTTE's ""international network"" over two decades in Canada and elsewhere largely justified some of this anxiety, I also suspected that these concerns were exaggerated. The misunderstanding stemmed from a lack of appropriate information. Surprisingly, there has been little in depth study of Tamil diaspora politics, and many have only a crude understanding of the diaspora itself and the nature of its links to the conflict in Sri Lanka. With the defeat of the LTTE, then, it was clear that diaspora activism in Canada and elsewhere would evolve, but the general public, the scholarly community, and government officials were uncertain of the nature of this transition. This dissertation is focused on clarifying what is happening. To this end we need to develop a much better understanding of the profoundly complicated internal dynamics of Tamil diaspora politics, from the 1980s to the present day. First, in the two chapters of Part 1, we examine the rise and fall of Tamil militancy in Sri Lanka, with a particular focus on the LTTE. Second, in Part II, we begin by discussing the arrival of the Tamil community in Canada, and much of its early organizational dynamics (Chapter 3). I then provide an extensive examination of the demonstrations that took place in Canada, from December 2008 to May 2009, during the final months of the war in Sri Lanka (Chapter 4). In Chapter 5, I then seek to delineate and examine the organizational dynamics of politics in the post-war diaspora community, with a particular focus on the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam (TGTE). Third and finally, in Part III, I further develop some strands of argument introduced in Chapter 4, and provide an in depth study of post-war Tamil youth identity. Chapter 6 begins by providing a cursory examination of the role of religion in the conflict in Sri Lanka, before arguing that the relationship between religion and politics in terms of the diaspora is not straightforward. Chapter 7 presents the wide-ranging views of Tamil youth in Canada with respect to the LTTE, Prabhakaran, Tamil Eelam, as well as the role of the diaspora in post-war Sri Lanka. As this chapter demonstrates, while the Tamil diaspora is often viewed as a homogenous bloc – with little variance in its die-hard support for the LTTE and its separatist platform – the opposite is true. Indeed, an accurate understanding of the Tamil diaspora, in Canada and elsewhere, must take into account its profound heterogeneity, and the diverging opinions of people in the diaspora about the LTTE, militancy, human rights, and the role of the diaspora community in post-war Sri Lanka.",1414751174,,Dissertations & Theses," Amarasingam, AmarnathAmarasingamAmarnathAmarasingam, Amarnath",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3031615711 , 80727232 , 66569 , 9780494942048 , NR94204 , NR94204", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9780494942048, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1414751174?accountid=14496," 0385 Canadian studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0385 Canadian studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0385 Canadian studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0385 Canadian studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Canadian studies , Political science , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Politics , Social movement activism , Sri Lankan , Tamil diaspora",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pain%2C+Pride%2C+and+Politics%3A+Social+Movement+Activism+and+the+Sri+Lankan+Tamil+Diaspora+in+Canada&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Amarasingam%2C+Amarnath&amp;isbn=9780494942048&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Studies on Performers and Place,"The installation Studies on Performers and Place explores social movement and ways of seeing bodies in basic architecture.

Methodologically, this research embraces a highly collaborative and multi-dimensional anthropological approach to understanding the rise and fall of new cultural paradigms. A variety of anthropological tools are utilized, including oral histories and traditions, genealogies, material culture, archival data, and genetics to investigate a complex Native and colonial American past, while providing the basis for a project that draws upon the various sub-fields within anthropology. Here, ethnogenesis is a central issue for understanding the principal patterns of this modern historiography. This work shows how local and transnational social and political forces interact to create new identities, even when they concern subjects from the past. Using these tools, this project uncovers the bases of and forces behind a Native American, diasporic reconnection movement, its many internal struggles, and the ways in which the movement has maintained a momentum now for more than a decade through a variety of cultural processes including adaptation, the creation of racial hierarchies, and power shifting. Special attention is paid here to the particular ways in which this community has actively chosen its historical narrative and then operationalized it in a way that permits its citizenry to intimately identify with Native Americans abroad. As this research is firmly grounded in a particular historical context, it illuminates aspects of a colonial American history that have yet to be fully told. What makes this project most unique is that it is designed to juxtapose the documentary, oral historical, genealogical, and biological records. An examination of all of these materials provides a basis for a project that merges the various sub-fields within anthropology. Adding genetics to this ethnohistoric investigation renders this approach unique.",1417072808,,Dissertations & Theses," Gaieski, Jill BennettGaieskiBennettJillGaieski, Jill Bennett",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3035038631 , 80626702 , 66569 , 9781303175459 , 3566382 , 3566382", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303175459, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1417072808?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0369 Genetics , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0369 Genetics , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0740 Native American studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0369 Genetics , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0740 Native American studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0369 Genetics , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0740 Native American studies"," Cultural anthropology , Genetics , Caribbean Studies , Native American studies"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Bermuda , Diaspora , Ethnohistory , Genetics , Native American , St. David's Island",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+St.+David%27s+Island+Project%3A++An+ethnogenesis+in+progress&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gaieski%2C+Jill+Bennett&amp;isbn=9781303175459&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Meeting of the Minds: The Franco-American Origins of Modern Comparative Law, 1900–1940","This dissertation traces the development of a modern approach to comparative law that arose out of the fin-de-siècle critique of nineteenth-century legal thought in France and the United States. This critique undermined a mode of legal reasoning that assumed the common law and the civil code were internally-coherent and gapless systems of rules from which judges could logically deduce legal outcomes. As rapid social and economic changes swept across the Atlantic World, jurists influenced by reform movements sought to make the law more responsive to changing conditions, while also addressing the problem of legal indeterminacy posed by the critique of deduction. One group of jurists—including Raymond Saleilles, Édouard Lambert, Roscoe Pound, and John Wigmore—responded to these challenges by turning to comparative law. Because they could no longer pretend to access static legal concepts, these jurists worked to achieve stability by formulating the best legal solution for a particular time and place—replacing timeless Truth with the historicized, spatial truths of comparative law. Before the First World War, however, French and American comparativists struggled to get beyond the differences between the common law and the civil law. Unlike the social theorists of the day, whose transatlantic exchanges constituted a veritable marketplace of ideas, the comparativists of the Progressive Era and the Belle Époque held each other at arm's length. This changed, however, when the Great War led to a profound realignment of intellectual affinities. As a result of the collateral damage suffered by Germany's scientific reputation, French and American jurists turned to different sources for legal exchange—each other. During the interwar period, Franco-American jurists sought to achieve a rapprochement that would unite their laws in a ""common law for the League of Nations."" This alliance finally bore fruit during two International Congresses of Comparative Law in the 1930s, but the intervening exchanges did not constitute a marketplace of ideas.

The thesis traces the history of tobacco, as cash crop, consumer product and addictive drug through institutional and discursive spaces, to demonstrate how material changes in tobacco, as result of sustained human intervention, has changed its chemical, physical and social nature. Simultaneously, I also show the effect of tobacco on some of the institutional and discursive spaces over time. In the thesis, I look at five spaces through which tobacco weaves in and out, agriculture, science, public health and law, tobacco industry and popular imagination. I also show how historical contingency, manipulation and accidents conspired to co-constitute the spaces and the substance through time, ultimately leading to the ""risky"" substance and consumer. I question the objectivity and universal rationalism of the scientific practices by demonstrating its ""situatedness"" within national-global power dynamics and the effects of scientific beliefs on advertising and the tobacco industry that led to the physical-chemical manipulation of the natural substance tobacco and vice versa. Central to the project is then a critical understanding of scientific practices as well as of the ""object"" of scientific study. The project shows that neither scientific practices nor object of scientific study can be viewed as stable concepts. However, the project is not a rejection of ontological realism rather it aims at a pragmatic understanding of the ""constructed"" nature of substances and practices.

Combining profits and the values of social responsibility, many benefit corporations in Hawaii strive to contribute to the betterment of the world in general and Hawaii in particular. The importance of integrating value and profit cannot be understated. It is a both/and occurrence that has been treated as an either/or option for too long. I endeavored to learn the valuable lessons of benefit corporations and created a best practices primer to guide small business social entrepreneurs that are interested in maximizing social value while pursuing a profitable enterprise. Secondary research areas included exploring aspects of personal and professional integration, creativity, interconnectedness, and collaboration. These research topics are important for several reasons. First, humans have ravaged environmental resources and experts have warned that the earth's viability is compromised by the negligence of its citizens to foster sustainable practices. New ways of doing business must be created that includes the environment as one of the stakeholders. Second, recent economic issues have highlighted the dangers of ""business as usual"" and the myopic focus on profits at any cost. Failing to consider the impact on neighbors and community is shortsighted at best and catastrophic at worst. Finally, advances in communication and connectivity have made the world smaller and shaping these values around a diverse global economy is essential to successfully navigate responsible business practices. Hawaii's cultural diversity and unique geographic isolation created a practical incubator to address these important issues. This research project yielded several findings related to B Corp certification and sustainable business corporation designation in Hawaii. The participants were committed to creating a better world through better business. They were proponents of the sustainability movement and articulated the equal importance of each pillar of the triple bottom line of people, planet, and profit. They viewed themselves as change agents committed to combining social values and business acumen.

This program provided educational opportunities to mostly immigrant garment workers, including courses in English, public speaking, psychology, American government, history and labor policy. Following Graff (1987), Brereton (1995), Brandt (2001), Prendergrast (2008) and Enoch (2008), this dissertation examines archival materials to analyze how the organization framed literacy and taught the English language to its worker-students. Much of the analysis examines how, what Brandt calls, ""sponsors of literacy,"" framed literacy in the program. This dissertation pays close attention to how particular rhetorical exigencies to the Union influenced the instructional outcomes of the literacy program. This research examines how sponsors of literacy influenced the literacy curriculum, how literacy became defined by wider rhetorical concerns of labor and social movements of the early 20th century, and how student literacy needs were instantiated in the program. I find that the rhetorical interests of the sponsors of literacy are manifest through the emphasis of the program on public speaking and service to the Union, which marginalized everyday literacy resources and writing skillsets. Finally, this study establishes a framework for examining the rhetorical functions of other educational programs, and argues that teaching literacy, as broadly or narrowly defined as the term may be, is also a rhetorical act as it trains learners to respond to particular rhetorical exigencies.",1420349304,,Dissertations & Theses," Bartolotta, Joseph PatrickBartolottaPatrickJosephBartolotta, Joseph Patrick",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3044919791 , 81054782 , 66569 , 9781303192029 , 3567398 , 3567398", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303192029, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1420349304?accountid=14496," 0516 Adult education , 0629 Labor relations , 0681 Rhetoric , 0998 Education philosophy"," 0516 Adult education , 0629 Labor relations , 0681 Rhetoric , 0998 Education philosophy"," 0516 Adult education , 0629 Labor relations , 0681 Rhetoric , 0998 Education philosophy",," 0516 Adult education , 0629 Labor relations , 0681 Rhetoric , 0998 Education philosophy"," Adult education , Labor relations , Rhetoric , Education philosophy"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Education , Adult education , International Ladies Garment Workers' Union , Labor education , Labor unions , Literacy , Triangle Shirtwaist fire",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Laboring+Literacy%3A+Rhetoric%2C+Language%2C+and+Sponsors+of+Literacy+in+Workers%27%0AEducation+in+the+International+Ladies+Garment+Workers%27+Union%2C+1914-1939&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bartolotta%2C+Joseph+Patrick&amp;isbn=9781303192029&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Transplanting cosmopolitans: The migrations of Sephardic Jews to Mexico, 1900–1934","This dissertation argues that Sephardic Jewish migrants to Mexico cultivated transnational identities and networks in order to acquire or perform the nationalities that provided them with the best means of social, economic, and geographic mobility in the face of growing state restrictions. Drawing on archival and press sources from Turkey, Mexico, the United States, Israel, and France, the dissertation begins in 1900 with the arrival of the first Sephardic immigrants in Mexico, and ends in 1934 when increasing state control on mobility marked the beginning of the end of the efficacy of Sephardic migratory practices. Chapter One addresses how initial Ottoman Sephardic migrants in Mexico were caught up in a process of defining national belonging. They resisted classification as either Ottoman expatriates or unequivocal Mexicans simply by maintaining a diasporic consciousness and connectedness with other Sephardic Jews, whether in the Ottoman homeland, the United States, France, or Cuba. Chapter Two argues that in spite of Ottoman demands that Sephardic subjects actively manifest their loyalty to the Ottoman war effort by serving in the armed forces, Mexico-based émigrés subverted Ottoman attempts to control them, performing alternative nationalities in order to facilitate their transnational travels in the face of increasing surveillance of movement during the First World War. The third chapter shows that during the period after the dissolution of the Ottoman Empire until 1927, Turkey castigated Sephardim as disloyal for their alleged ties to Spain, while the perceived Hispanic heritage shared by Mexicans and Sephardim marked Sephardim as desirable immigrants in Mexico. The final chapter examines the period until 1934, during which time, Turkey increased Turkification efforts, while Mexico legislated against both Jewish and Turkish migrants. Nonetheless, those Turkish Sephardim desirous of settling in Mexico bypassed Mexican attempts to restrict their entry by obfuscating their Jewish and Turkish origins, simultaneously removing themselves from Turkish control.",1427852769,,Dissertations & Theses," Mays, DeviMaysDeviMays, Devi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3054693301 , 80233202 , 66569 , 9781303251498 , 3587751 , 3587751", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303251498, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1427852769?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0336 Latin American history , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0336 Latin American history , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0336 Latin American history , 0751 Judaic studies",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0336 Latin American history , 0751 Judaic studies"," Middle Eastern history , Latin American history , Judaic studies"," Social sciences , Citizenship , Jewish , Mexico , Migration , Ottoman Empire , Turkey",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transplanting+cosmopolitans%3A+The+migrations+of+Sephardic+Jews+to+Mexico%2C+1900%E2%80%931934&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mays%2C+Devi&amp;isbn=9781303251498&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Private Religion and Public Morality: Understanding Culturual Secularism in Late Capitalist Japan,"It has become a truism in anthropology and sociology of postcolonial, post-socialist, and post-industrial societies that increasing global interconnectedness and the forces of global capitalism have produced both a worldwide proliferation and a local diversification of religious and secular ideologies and moral authorities. In many societies, morality in its institutional and ideological forms of religion and secularism have become pluralized or radicalized, which has raised a number of debates about how to negotiate and manage different moral and ethical values among individuals from different religious and political backgrounds in an increasingly globalized world. Like many other late capitalist societies, Japan is in the midst of economic restructuring, political uncertainty, and the transformation of social institutions. However, despite these challenges, claims for moral authority and social reform by religious groups—one of the most active forces in many other societies—have been notably absent from the public sphere and from daily life in Japan. Instead, members of what I call ""vitalistic associations"" which emerged out of Japan's postwar secularization and democratization have continued to work in the ""margins"" to support ""mainstream"" Japanese society. Through participant-observation and interviews with members of seven organizations including a Shinto-Christian organization that advocates ""magical"" faith-healing and a Neo-Confucian organization that advocates ""pious"" daily routines, my research reveals how religious and spiritual practices can be deeply embedded within broader moral values, and participation need not produce religious identities or rival moral authorities. Instead, religious and spiritual practices can become malleable repertoires of simultaneously ""vitalistic"" and ""secularized"" practices for self-improvement and for overcoming the challenges of daily life. This logic of vitalism is intrinsically tied with a kind of self-advancement which crosses the boundaries of the religious and the secular. Part One frames religion and morality in Japan within anthropological debates on secularization and religion and the rise of ""new religions"" in modern Japan. I argue that Japanese secularity is best understood as a ""double movement"" marked by macro-level secularization on the politico-legal and public levels of religious privatization, and micro-level secularization within Japanese religion in the form of teachings and practices that are increasingly directed toward members' ""secular"" self-advancement in work and family life. In Chapter 1, I explore the first mechanism of this double movement by analyzing theories of secularization, the particular conditions of political and legal secularity in Japan, and theories of religious subjectivity. In Chapter 2, I explore the second mechanism of this double movement by analyzing how religious and spiritual organizations grew amidst postwar modernization and urbanization. In Part Two, I analyze the specific challenges and changes in the institutions and lives of members of these organizations in post-bubble, post-Aum Japan. In Chapter 3, I look at the ""price of belief"" in terms of the efforts required of members. I examine how challenging socioeconomic conditions for organizations have pushed new demands onto members to ""work hard"" to materialize their belief, which has also produced creative and unintended responses by members, and I argue that the price of belief does not undermine the symbolic and personal meaning for members. In Chapter 4, I analyze the challenges of changing demographics and urban conditions, and how members and organizations are navigating and negotiating these changes. In Chapter 5, I analyze members' engagements with organizational teachings and goals. I show how individuals interpret and co-opt organizational teachings and practices for their own motivations and needs, and how this can also delink personal goals from organizational goals. In the Conclusion, I suggest that ""cultural secularism""—in which religious and spiritual beliefs and practices are seen as part of and directed toward social life—can nuance notions of religion, morality, and subjectivity by highlighting how religious participation and practice in Japan is not premised on the cultivation of distinctive religious subjectivities and the articulation of religious identity politics, but rather is subsumed within broader public morality. This morality is rooted in a vitalistic and humanistic cosmology that undergirds religious and secular life, and which sees individuals as inextricably connected through the effects and affects of their actions. Ultimately, I show that despite continued secularization, the decline of religious institutions, and intensifying economic, structural, demographic, and urban disconnection, individuals remain connected through public morality. Moreover, ""cultural secularism"" continues to resonate across both religious and non-religious individuals' lives, even as the institutionalized and public forms of vitalistic beliefs are increasingly receding into the private spaces of individual practice. In this way, I offer new insight on the nature of secularity, religious practice, and morality under late capitalism.",1432432593,,Dissertations & Theses," Gagne, Isaac ThomasGagneThomasIsaacGagne, Isaac Thomas",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3072008321 , 81674142 , 66569 , 9781303297342 , 3571938 , 3571938", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303297342, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1432432593?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Capitalism , Japan , Morality , Secularism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Private+Religion+and+Public+Morality%3A+Understanding+Culturual+Secularism+in+Late+Capitalist+Japan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gagne%2C+Isaac+Thomas&amp;isbn=9781303297342&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Raids, Race, and Lessons of Fear and Resistance: Narratives and Discourse in the Immigration Movement in Arizona","Arizona has become infamous for its strong nativist and anti-immigrant climate, gaining national and international attention for legislation and policing practices that are in violation of civil and human rights.

Simultaneously, organizing strategies and discourse of immigrant rights advocates reflect an entanglement of perceived identities and a struggle to negotiate, contest, and redefine boundaries of public space.

During this period, a diverse group of activists began to organize in order to spread modern contraceptives to the working classes. These efforts provoked widespread debate over reproduction and led to the opening of the region's first birth control clinics from the 1930s to 1950s. Birth control advocates also pressured politicians to support the cause, and by the late 1960s/early 1970s nearly every newly-independent government in the region had committed itself to state-funded family planning services. Utilizing papers of family planning advocates and associations, government records, newspapers, pamphlets, and reports, this study places these birth control campaigns and debates within the context of Caribbean political and social movements, the rise of the international birth control campaign, working class family life and gender relations, the decline of British rule, and the expansion of political independence across the region. It demonstrates that — as argued by much of the scholarly literature on the international birth control movement — early campaigns in the West Indies were initiated and funded largely by local and foreign (white) elites, and were pushed by many conservative actors who blamed political and economic instability on working class (black) fertility as a means to stave off wider reforms. However, this study also shows that the birth control cause found support among a much wider demographic on these islands, including anti-imperial politicians who incorporated birth control into broader development plans, doctors, nurses, and social workers who saw it as a critical measure to aid working class families, black nationalist feminists who argued that it was a woman's right, and working class women and men who seized the opportunity to exercise a measure of control over their reproductive lives.

In a first moment, we ask whether the ""right to immigrate"" made sense only before the mass international migration movements starting around 1980, and be-fore ""globalisation"", and whether polities today are morally justified in adopting increasingly harsh immigration restriction measures unilaterally. After rejecting this hypothesis by using an interdisciplinary analysis of the changes in the phenomenon of human mobility in recent dec-ades, we propose another hypothesis to resolve the tension. We claim that the two rights are not ""absolute"" rights, and must be kept in tension. Which one of them trumps the other in con-crete situations is determined partly by a set of (moral) priority rules, and partly through politi-cal discernment via fair democratic processes (which are always necessary so as to formulate concrete policies which require the consent of the governed). The rest of this dissertation pro-vides a well-documented argument in favour of this second hypothesis, and in the process, we formulate a number of priority rules which help activists and policy makers, qua citizens and qua Christian disciples, adjudicate between rights claims based on the right to immigrate and the right to political sovereignty. The work also includes a systematic and historical presentation of Catholic Social Teaching on migration, a case study on immigration and emigration in Malta, a diachronic analysis of concepts related to human mobility in the Hebrew Bible, a philosophical reflection on Political Sovereignty in a ""globalising"" world, and a virtue ethics approach to the notions of solidarity, hospitality and kinship.",1437663723,,Dissertations & Theses," Micallef, Rene MarioMicallefMarioReneMicallef, Rene Mario",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3085553991 , 77718602 , 66569 , 9781303348334 , 3592980 , 3592980", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303348334, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1437663723?accountid=14496," 0394 Ethics , 0422 Philosophy , 0469 Theology , 0601 International Relations"," 0394 Ethics , 0422 Philosophy , 0469 Theology , 0601 International Relations"," 0394 Ethics , 0422 Philosophy , 0469 Theology , 0601 International Relations",," 0394 Ethics , 0422 Philosophy , 0469 Theology , 0601 International Relations"," Ethics , Philosophy , Theology , International Relations"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Asylum , Border policy , Catholic , Globalization , Immigration , Refugee , Sovereignty",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gates+Fair+on+All+Sides.+Christian+Reflections+on+Establishing+Ethical+and+Sustainable+Border+Policies+and+Citizenship+Laws+in+a+%22Globalised%22+World&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Micallef%2C+Rene+Mario&amp;isbn=9781303348334&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Sylvia and Nancy, Parasol Pals: A Friendship that Binds; Black Liberation from the Perspective of the White Hand During the Turn of the Twentieth Century","The power of the written word has the ability to move the masses into action!

Nearly a century later, sweeping immigration reform led to the influx of thousands of Asian immigrants who transformed the region's social, economic, and physical landscapes. Southern Orientation: Reimagining Asian American Identity and Place in the Global South utilizes twentieth- and twenty-first-century literature, film, and oral histories to investigate how the socio-spatial practices of Asians produce new iterations of place-bound identities that unsettle traditional notions of southern community. Drawing from spatial theory, cultural trauma, and ecocriticism, this dissertation argues that the appearance of the Asian engenders new anxieties and reawakens past anxieties about racial and ethnic integration in the post-Jim Crow South. However, the growing visibility of Asians in the region also hints at the possibility of new multiracial and multiethnic coalitions and new place-bound communal identities centered on the shared struggle against material, social, and spatial inequalities. With the exception of a few studies, there is a noticeable lack of scholarship on Asian Americans in southern literature and film. But the increased focus on the South in a global context and the growing number of narratives depicting Asians living in the region are compelling reasons to further explore the ways in which Asians influence and are influenced by southern cultural practices. These recent texts highlight the global movements of peoples, cultures, and economies that mark the region as both a transformed and transformative place. Works including Monique Truong's short story ""Kelly"" (1991) and Cynthia Kadohata's children's novel Kira-Kira (2004) illustrate how the internationalization of southern locales can reintroduce segregationist practices as a means of safeguarding long-held communal boundaries based on racial, ethnic, and class differences. Other narratives such as Mira Nair's film Mississippi Masala (1991) and Cynthia Shearer's novel The Celestial Jukebox (2004) reveal how Asians are part of a larger narrative of exploitation, exclusion, and survival that interweaves the history of multiple ""Souths."" For Asians migrating to the American South, defining home often involves the complex interplay between stasis and movement, acceptance and opposition, remembering and forgetting. This study foregrounds the critical intersections between Southern studies and Asian American cultural politics in order to better understand how global processes influence the ways in which an increasingly multiracial and multiethnic population define, inhabit, and transform communities in the American South.",1445254673,,Dissertations & Theses," Cha, Frank SungChaSungFrankCha, Frank Sung",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3109665881 , 80489302 , 66569 , 9781303488634 , 3574203 , 3574203", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303488634, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1445254673?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0629 Labor relations"," 0323 American studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0629 Labor relations"," 0323 American studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0629 Labor relations",," 0323 American studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0629 Labor relations"," American studies , Asian American Studies , American literature , Labor relations"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Asian American identity , Chinese immigrants , Kelly , Kira-Kira , Mississippi Masala , Post-Jim Crow South , Southern literature , Southern race relations , Spatial practices , The Celestial Jukebox",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Southern+Orientation%3A+Reimagining+Asian+American+Identity+and+Place+in+the+Global+South&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cha%2C+Frank+Sung&amp;isbn=9781303488634&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The impact of human rights law in time,"International human rights law is often disparaged either for having no positive impact on government repression or for having negative unintended consequences that lead to even worse repressive violence. Most empirical scholarship on human rights indicates that the root causes of widespread repression—authoritarianism, democratic instability, and civil war—are beyond the reach of legal rules. The contribution of this project is to demonstrate that human rights law in fact has an important role to play in addressing these root causes. I argue that the human rights legal action, under certain conditions, promotes democracy and prevents conflict recurrence. This takes time. By slowly changing state-society interactions, the pursuit of human rights legalization is causally related to lessened repressive violence. Importantly, though, these contributions are not guaranteed, and they are dependent on the creation of domestic human rights constituencies. In support of my argument, I uncover relationships between human rights legal actions and regime change, broadly defined, that have so far remained unobserved. These relationships have been obscured within the existing literature for two reasons. First, detailed data on various legal mechanisms has until recently been lacking. Using new data collected over a 3-year period in coordination with the Oxford-Minnesota Transitional Justice Collaborative (OMTJC), in addition to other longitudinal data from a variety of sources, I address this data deficit in my research. Second, to see the positive impact of human rights legal action on democracy and peace, one must zoom out and observe change over the long term. This dissertation is the first to give serious consideration to issues of time and process in the study of human rights law. In its wide sweep, the dissertation also provides new evidence of robust links between social movements and pursuit of rights-based legalization; between `transitional justice' and the long-term decline of repression; and between enforcement of human rights law and the non-recurrence of civil war. Overall, I find reason to be skeptical of human rights critics, who base their arguments about consequences on short-term events, rather than analyzing larger processes of social transformation.",1447014720,,Dissertations & Theses," Dancy, Geoffrey T.DancyT.GeoffreyDancy, Geoffrey T.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3112856281 , 75914542 , 66569 , 9781303427695 , 3596311 , 3596311", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303427695, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1447014720?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology"," 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology"," 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology",," 0398 Law , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law , 0626 Sociology"," Law , Political science , International law , Sociology"," Social sciences , Constituencies , Human rights , Law , Long-term change , Repression , Transitional justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+of+human+rights+law+in+time&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dancy%2C+Geoffrey+T.&amp;isbn=9781303427695&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""Truth, Justice, and the Performative Way!"" Superhero Performance and the Battle for Social Justice in Twenty-First Century America","""Who is Barack Obama? Contrary to the rumors you have heard, I was not born in a manger. I was actually born on Krypton, and sent here by my father, Jor-El, to save the planet Earth."" —Barack Obama, Oct. 17, 2008 Appearing simultaneously in major blockbuster films, Broadway musicals, and many other media formats, the ubiquitous superhero remains one of America's most enduring cultural icons. Shrewdly, Obama spoke the words above just before the 2008 election and hitched his political performance to the popular mythology of Superman. Multiple representations of ""Super-Obama"" soon followed across diverse media platforms as he transformed from mild-mannered candidate to a political superhero charged with saving America. Appropriating the iconography of Superman, Obama tapped into that famous mantra of ""truth, justice and the American way,"" and joined the growing social practice of Americans portraying themselves as superheroes to challenge unjust assumptions about class, gender, sexual identity, and race. In shedding their seemingly disempowered everyday identities and donning the theatricalized forms of their pop cultural heroes, these performers restage themselves as the physical and political ideals of Americanism. Obama, in casting himself as Superman, laid claim to the ultimate jingoistic representation of white heterosexual maleness despite being a biracial liberal whom his opposition portrays as ""soft"" on terrorism. I argue that by embodying the superhero, Barack Obama and others distanced from that supposed ideal of Americanism, turn popular myths back on those in power. They debunk the ""truth"" of America's social divisions, demand greater advances in social justice, and explore a new American way that subverts the social inequalities of twenty-first century America. Deceptively multifaceted, the superhero emerged as a uniquely American literary creation, though one largely written off as escapist fare for puerile minds. As this project demonstrates, the superhero actually represents a complex unraveling of embedded mythologies including those of American exceptionalism and the American Dream. Superheroes possess surprising ambiguity as equally strong icons of social progress and also brash defenders of the social status-quo. Most scholarship on the superhero focuses on mediatized appearances (Jenkins, Gordon) or a combination of comic book history and semiotics (Eco, Bukatman, Singer). I build upon their methods by applying theories of performance and theatricality as tools that visually modify and overwrite reality with illusion (Davis &amp; Postlewait, Burns). Ultimately, I investigate how adopting the superhero form allows Americans to combat social inequities in the age of Obama. Though some forces assert that Obama's presidency proves that boundaries of class, gender, sexual identity, and race are no longer insurmountable, I expose that these inequalities remain and are being restaged in the rhetoric of superheroes. By embodying the anarchist ""hero"" Citizen V from the comic book and film V for Vendetta, some members of the Occupy Movement threaten revolution while demanding the end of economic inequalities. Additionally, my ethnographic study at Comic-Con International, the world's largest convention celebrating the popular arts, critiques the gender-bending and race-bending practice of ""crossplayers,"" costumed attendees who switch the genders and perceived races of popular superheroes in their performances and subvert associations of white maleness. Similarly, I argue that the superhero allows gay revelers at superhero-themed parties to deny their marginalized status by adopting and distorting the masculine ideal he represents. I then illustrate how even Barack Obama's rise to the presidency utilized superhero imagery and its associations with nationalism and physical power, providing a biracial candidate with access to the utopic whiteness of Superman. My dissertation brings vital scholarly attention to the ways in which superhero performance may challenge popular culture's continual re-inscription of the values of white, heterosexual maleness. I expose that the superhero's prevalence in popular culture grants all Americans a shared language and cultural currency that can be used even by the disenfranchised to make their voices heard. Thus these progressive superhero performances work as benchmarks by which we may measure and question the state of social equality in America today.",1448526394,,Dissertations & Theses," Anderson, Kyle Kane BurrittAndersonKane BurrittKyleAnderson, Kyle Kane Burritt",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3117889241 , 78959862 , 66569 , 9781303424502 , 3596061 , 3596061", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303424502, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1448526394?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0323 American studies , 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0323 American studies , 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0323 American studies , 0465 Theater , 0641 Performing Arts"," American studies , Theater , Performing Arts"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Performance , Social justice , Superheroes , Theatricality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Truth%2C+Justice%2C+and+the+Performative+Way%21%22+Superhero+Performance+and+the+Battle+for+Social+Justice+in+Twenty-First+Century+America&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Anderson%2C+Kyle+Kane+Burritt&amp;isbn=9781303424502&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Prescription for a Nation: Public Health in Post-Revolutionary Bolivia, 1952–1964","This dissertation examines the extension of public health programs into the countryside following the 1952 Bolivian National Revolution, which put the Movimiento Nacionalista Revolucionario (National Revolutionary Movement, MNR) into power. Historical studies of the Bolivian Revolution have focused on its political and economic agenda, mainly agrarian reform, nationalization of the mining industry, and granting of universal suffrage to formerly disenfranchised populations. However, public health was as important to the revolutionary government's plan for political, economic, and cultural consolidation as these well-explored topics. Though public health programs focused on maternal and infant health, vaccinations, and disease control projects, I argue they were designed to consolidate and institutionalize the revolution, boost a faltering economy, and foster revolutionary nationalism. Public health provides a lens for a cultural analysis of the MNR's political, economic, and social agenda and reveals the gender and racial dynamics of the revolutionary state formation process. Health campaigns in Bolivia in the 1950s and 1960s were linked to hierarchies of gender, race, and citizenship; the MNR thought public health programs would eradicate a perceived impediment to Bolivia's progress by transforming rural living conditions, linking indigenous communities to the national government, and producing a healthy citizenry and workforce. Local, national, and international levels of analysis provide a multifaceted understanding of the negotiation of health, citizenship, and identity during the revolutionary period and show that health campaigns were created and contested in multiple political and cultural arenas. Internationally, the MNR relied on funding and personnel from the United States and incorporated international public health rhetoric into its own campaigns.

Data was collected over seventeen months of ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2007 and 2011, during which time I took on the role of a volunteer in a grassroots gay men's group. Based on extensive qualitative research, such as daily participant-observation carried out in a variety of locations including NGO offices, private homes, bars, bathhouses and cruising areas in public parks, as well as in-depth interviews with gay and lesbian NGO leaders and volunteers, local community members and government officials, this dissertation develops a vivid and personal account of everyday gay and lesbian life in urban northwest China. A rich and complex local gay and lesbian culture is taking shape as social and economic reforms give people greater leeway to begin expressing their sexualities more openly as well as to develop new forms of intimacy and kinship, even as they continue to struggle to find ways to cope with enduring social and familial norms and expectations such as marrying and having children. At the same time, in spite of continuing legal restrictions on voluntary associations in China, the threat of HIV/AIDS is compelling the state to tolerate and even cooperate with a growing number of unregistered grassroots gay NGOs in order to provide HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment services to ""men who have sex with men"" who can be difficult for the state to reach on its own. However, even as grassroots gay NGOs play an increasingly important role in government HIV/AIDS prevention and treatment efforts, many local gay and lesbian groups are also pursuing a broader social and political agenda: increasing the awareness and acceptance of homosexuality in Chinese society.",1449841519,,Dissertations & Theses," Miller, Casey J.MillerJ.CaseyMiller, Casey J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3123404621 , 78550522 , 66569 , 9781303440755 , 3596790 , 3596790", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303440755, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1449841519?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0492 GLBT Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies , GLBT Studies"," Social sciences , AIDS , China , Civil society , Gender , Homosexuality , Nongovernmental organization (NGO) , Postsocialist , Sexuality",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Inside+the+Circle%3A+Sexuality%2C+HIV%2FAIDS%2C+and+Civil+Society+in+Post-Socialist+Northwest+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Miller%2C+Casey+J.&amp;isbn=9781303440755&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The domestication of ""the Arab Spring"": A comparative analysis of media representations in South Korea and the U.S.","This dissertation examines not only the ways in which the major newspapers of the U.S. and South Korea portrayed the Arab Spring, but also the behind-the-scenes factors influencing these portrayals. It explores the interconnected process through which news frames were affected by three factors: dominant ideologies, national interests, and journalistic values/routines. As such, it is the first cross-national study to compare U.S. and South Korean media coverage of a social movement occurring outside the territory of either country. A mixed method design combined a discourse analysis of opinion pieces, a content analysis of news stories, and interviews with journalists in order to 1) find ideological packages composed of frames, metaphors, exemplars, and catch phrases; 2) examine both ""news sources"" and ""news frames""; and 3) check the validity of the text analysis. The discourse analysis demonstrates that while the American papers highlighted how the Arab Spring affects its national interests on issues such as terrorism, Israel, and American leadership, the South Korean papers focused on assessing the possibility of whether or not the Arab Spring might have an influence on democratic changes in North Korea. The South Korean coverage also reflected a great deal of national anxiety about the country's continued survival and prosperity as a divided and foreign oil-dependent country. The content analysis reveals that the American papers more frequently portrayed the Arab Spring as a civil war within Arab nations than did the South Korean papers. One possible explanation for this difference could lie in the differing national interests and histories of intervention abroad. American papers presented the Arab Spring as primarily an internal, ethnic conflict, one not easily amenable to solutions imposed from the outside. Since Korea was unlikely to ever send troops to the region, its papers were freer to portray the Arab Spring as a democratic movement, and thus potentially worthy of international intervention. According to the study's interviews with journalists, Korean reporters attributed their reliance on Western media as sources to a lack of economic resources and to the barriers presented by non-Western languages. In contrast, the U.S. journalists ascribed their tendency to quote a wide variety of sources as originating from the strong American tradition of investigative reporting conducted at great personal risk. International reporting of the Arab Spring by American and South Korean media was highly constrained by the boundaries of these two nation-states. The three factors of dominant ideologies, national interests, and journalistic values/routines enabled the process of ""the domestication of the world"" by these newspapers of record in South Korea and the U.S.",1461435421,,Dissertations & Theses," Ha, Jae SikHaSikJaeHa, Jae Sik",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3136821471 , 79248122 , 66569 , 9781303483394 , 3599183 , 3599183", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303483394, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1461435421?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0391 Journalism , 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0391 Journalism , 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0391 Journalism , 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0391 Journalism , 0459 Communication , 0708 Mass communications"," Asian Studies , Journalism , Communication , Mass communications"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Arab Spring , Journalism , Media , Middle East , News , South Korea , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+domestication+of+%22the+Arab+Spring%22%3A+A+comparative+analysis+of+media+representations+in+South+Korea+and+the+U.S.&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ha%2C+Jae+Sik&amp;isbn=9781303483394&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Tracing feminisms in Brazil: Locating gender, race, and global power relations in &lt;i&gt;Revista Estudos Feministas&lt;/i&gt; publications","Women’s movements and feminisms in Brazil have taken various forms throughout the years, contributing significantly to socio-political actions that favor gender justice.

The invisibility of Brazilian feminisms within feminist scholarship in the United States, therefore, justifies the need for further research on the topic.

Group Center organized art exhibitions, lectures and jazz shows and Black Mask produced an eponymous Dada-influenced broadside and participated widely in anti-war agitation. Eventually taking the name Up Against the Wall/Motherfucker, the group ran crash pads, neighborhood watch brigades and a local free store. These groups also persistently performed actions against the art world, including protests against the Museum of Modern Art, Lincoln Center, and even the New York School poets. This dissertation argues that such protests were aimed at the institutionalization of culture, but also at the very logic of representation. Situating Group Center and Black Mask's early aesthetic experimentalism as central to the formation of their anti-representationalism, the dissertation follows these groups' collaborations with the artist Aldo Tambellini on a series of ""electromedia"" performances that addressed the rise of Black Liberation within abstract form. In addition, the dissertation traces the connections between these collectives and a broad range of art practices in which they were engaged, including televisual art, a nascent ""expanded cinema"" scene, Intermedia, art practices surrounding Judson Memorial Church, a radical theater scene surrounding the anarchist Living Theatre, early Minimalism and the Black Arts Movement. Alongside this cultural history, the dissertation follows these groups' relationships to the politics of numerous contemporaneous leftist groups including New York Anarchists, the Situationist International, Students for a Democratic Society, the Black Power movement and Radical Feminism. While the groups that form the core of this study eventually rejected art practice in favor of ""the real"" of on-the-ground activism, I argue that the negotiations between politics and form entailed by their earlier aesthetic experimentalism were constitutive of the anti-representational politics they would later embody. Operating at the intersection of aesthetic and political avant-gardes, Group Center, Black Mask and Up Against the Wall/Motherfucker have resisted historical legibility because they maintained an ambivalent relationship to the era's prevailing ""new social movements"" as well as most institutionalized art movements. This project thus aims to open out this ""minor history"" to a broad range of influences in order to show how the extremity of these groups' anti-representational militancy was no mere aberration from the modernist project, but rather, an attempt to push the avant-gardist protest against the separation between art and life to its limits, and beyond.",1465039477,,Dissertations & Theses," Millner-Larsen, NadjaMillner-LarsenNadjaMillner-Larsen, Nadja",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3146527091 , 77540012 , 66569 , 9781303497407 , 3599929 , 3599929", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303497407, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1465039477?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0323 American studies , 0377 Art history , 0641 Performing Arts"," American studies , Art history , Performing Arts"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , 1960s , Activism , Anarchist anti-art collectives , Avant-garde , Black Mask , Group Center , Visual culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Up+against+the+real%3A+Anti-representational+militancy+in+1960s+New+York&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Millner-Larsen%2C+Nadja&amp;isbn=9781303497407&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Avant-Garde and Socialist Dreamworlds in Latin America: Global and Local Designs, 1919–1939","This dissertation examines the avant-garde as one of the last significant cultural manifestations in Latin America that attempted to offer an alternative to capitalism in the twentieth century. My study redefines the avant-garde as a global critique of modernity whose emergence can only be explained from a geopolitical perspective. During this time, the world order dictated that metropolitan areas like Western Europe be engaged in a mutual economic dependence with peripheral regions such as Latin America. Consequently, a revolutionary socialist impulse originated from within secondary economic areas in the world like Russia and Latin America. Movements such as Dada and Cubism conveyed the necessity for art to break from the autonomous status attributed to it by the bourgeoisie; but ultimately, these aesthetic projects did not address an essential component of the changing social picture, namely the articulation of collective fantasies directed at the emerging masses. The avant-garde was able to articulate these dreamworlds only after art intersected with socialism. With this convergence art claimed a different kind of autonomy, one not based on innocuous insularity but on a socially conscious critical capacity. The revolutionary discourse that resulted from the combination of political and artistic realms aimed at addressing the masses as an integral part of a new modern society. The chapters include muralism (Diego Rivera), periodicals ( Amauta ), and poetry (César Vallejo). Building upon local and global geopolitical perspectives, these works constructed socialist dreamworlds, expressions of utopian desires to transform the world, against the backdrop of art's tendency toward new modes of production and aesthetic sensibilities in the early twentieth century. Sifting through the ruins of these cultural artifacts, I discuss topics such as the figure of the intellectual and the history of radical ideas in Latin America; Marxism; public art and state sponsorship; iconography of revolution and spectrality; and the autonomy of art at the intersection of politics and aesthetics.",1465065345,,Dissertations & Theses," Castillo, Mauricio A.CastilloA.MauricioCastillo, Mauricio A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3146738351 , 83507202 , 66569 , 9781303506437 , 3600516 , 3600516", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303506437, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1465065345?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0377 Art history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Latin American literature , Art history , Latin American Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Amauta , Avant-garde , Indigenismo , Mariategui, Jose Carlos , Mexico , Muralism , Peru , Rivera, Diego , Socialist , Vallejo, Cesar",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Avant-Garde+and+Socialist+Dreamworlds+in+Latin+America%3A+Global+and+Local+Designs%2C+1919%E2%80%931939&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Castillo%2C+Mauricio+A.&amp;isbn=9781303506437&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Social networks and collective action outcomes: Do mobilization and alliance structures matter?,"Despite increasing scholarly interest in the relationship between social networks and collective action, there is still limited evidence on how networks matter at the global level in shaping collective action outcomes, and how these structures emerge in the first place. Consequently, this dissertation aims at addressing these relations within the context of collective action campaigns, and neighborhood level protest events that were identified using police records in Ankara, Turkey between 2006 and 2011. The analysis of inter-organizational alliance networks shows that political opportunity structure related factors such as presence or absence of elite allies, relative openness or closeness of the institutional environment, still matter the most in understanding why some movements succeed while others don't in realizing their stated policy outcomes in semi-democratic settings. Different network structures have consequences only when political environment is conducive for successful outcomes. With regard to explaining tie strength, certain homophily mechanisms such as operating at the same level of jurisdiction and specializing in similar issues areas seem to be most powerful in revealing why some organizations work intensively with each other while others don’t. At neighborhood level protest events, the form and nature of pre-existing social networks present in the neighborhood appear to be highly associated with the outcome of the protest events. Spatial arrangements are found to be very influential in the construction of these existing networks. Findings suggest that hierarchical information networks are effective in mobilizing large numbers of participants for protest events whereas presence or absence of strong ties are crucial for explaining why only certain protest groups tend to embrace high-risk, disruptive protest strategies. Overall, findings of this study indicate that different network structures interact with contextual factors in complex ways, and that certain types of networks are conducive to successful policy outcomes in combination with specific causal factors in particular contexts.",1466304440,,Dissertations & Theses," Yenigun, Gunes ErtanYenigunErtanGunesYenigun, Gunes Ertan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3151347881 , 81754362 , 66569 , 9781303590375 , 3577001 , 3577001", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303590375, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1466304440?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0646 Web Studies"," 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0646 Web Studies"," 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0646 Web Studies",," 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy , 0646 Web Studies"," Political science , Public policy , Web Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Collective action , Social networks , Turkey",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+networks+and+collective+action+outcomes%3A+Do+mobilization+and+alliance+structures+matter%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yenigun%2C+Gunes+Ertan&amp;isbn=9781303590375&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Cultural models of respectful subjectivity among primary school children in post-conflict Ayacucho, Peru: An embodied learning analysis","In this dissertation, I approach the question of how educational policy and practice can shape children into peaceful, democratic citizens in a context of recent internal armed conflict. Broadly, I address the issue of how to make internationally derived policy discourses meaningful for children. Specifically, my study focuses on primary school students aged six to ten years old in a small town of southern Ayacucho, Peru that was devastated by the violence of Shining Path militants and state counterinsurgency troops in the 1980s-1990s. This is one of many postconflict towns in Peru that continue to be targeted by state interventions framed by discourses of counterinsurgency and reconciliation. This research is based on fourteen months of ethnographic fieldwork with children and their families in which I engaged in participant observation in all realms of children’s lives. I examine how policy documents shaped by international development organizations influence, or fail to influence, classroom practice and learning among schoolchildren in a bilingual (Quechua-Spanish) Andean agricultural community. I develop the concept of respectful subjectivity as a culturally shared foundational schema underlying understandings of personhood and interpersonal relations among the children with whom I worked. I examine respectful subjectivity as a foundational cultural model that encompasses several domain-specific models which guide children’s behavior in particular situations. According to the foundational model of respectful subjectivity that I identified, one must respect the social order and ensure that others who form part of one’s social group also respect the social order so that the group as a whole can earn the respect of outsiders. This theoretical perspective has allowed me to compare children’s emergent embodied understandings of their own subjectivity with policy discourses about citizenship education, in order to identify gaps between the two and explore ways to close them. My methods are designed to allow for an analysis of embodied learning in at least two senses: I see children’s learning as both situated and multimodal. In order to account for the multiple situations and multiple modes through which children learn and develop a sense of moral subjectivity, I collected data through participant observation, interviews, and audiovisual documentation during family, school, and peer group activities. I used video and audio recording, photography, and written human movement notation in addition to written field notes of my subjective experiences, in order to document and analyze the communicative functions of children’s spatial relations, bodily postures, gestures, and speech, among other modalities. These methods allowed me to get at unarticulated models of respectful subjectivity that offer a bridge between children’s lived experience and policy discourses. I offer innovative theoretical and methodological approaches for exploring tensions between policy and practice that influence access to citizenship rights in a variety of realms, and argue that locally rooted models of interpersonal relations can serve as a path to more effective promotion of democracy, cultural inclusion, and human rights at school.",1467479762,,Dissertations & Theses," Grim-Feinberg, KateGrim-FeinbergKateGrim-Feinberg, Kate",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3154109871 , 83824952 , 66569 , 9781303579325 , 3603373 , 3603373", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303579325, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1467479762?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Education Policy , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Education , Andes , Child rearing , Citizenship education , Cognitive anthropology , Educational policy , Embodied learning",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cultural+models+of+respectful+subjectivity+among+primary+school+children+in+post-conflict+Ayacucho%2C+Peru%3A+An+embodied+learning+analysis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grim-Feinberg%2C+Kate&amp;isbn=9781303579325&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Understanding State-Labor Relations in Morsi's Egypt: Moving beyond Islamic Narratives,"Two presidents have been disposed since the 2011 uprising, both largely the result of mobilization efforts from the country's labor movement. Though Egypt's current economic crisis is a main focus of international attention, President Morsi and the ruling regime's strategies to deadlock worker's reform initiatives remain largely unacknowledged. This paper provides two crucial explanations for this phenomenon that are insufficiently addressed by current social movement theories. The first concerns (1) the misrepresentation of the Muslim Brotherhood in current scholarship as a philanthropic organization and thus, an actor with interests congruent with the working/poorer classes, and secondly, (2) the regime's ability to suppress labor reforms while simultaneously instituting a facade of democratic measures to curtail criticism. I begin by providing an alternative narrative of the Muslim Brotherhood's trajectory that challenges a dominant framework prevalent with inaccuracies about their political motivations, and thus their relationship to social justice issues more broadly. Secondly, I offer an analysis of the regime's response to workers' strikes during Morsi's term in the current economic context.",1468682704,,Dissertations & Theses," Crowell, Jamison CurtisCrowellCurtisJamisonCrowell, Jamison Curtis",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3158520631 , 83990592 , 66569 , 9781303538063 , 1548226 , 1548226", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303538063, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1468682704?accountid=14496," 0391 Journalism , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0391 Journalism , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0391 Journalism , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0391 Journalism , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0615 Political science"," Journalism , Middle Eastern Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Egypt , Morsi , Muslim Brotherhood",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Understanding+State-Labor+Relations+in+Morsi%27s+Egypt%3A+Moving+beyond+Islamic+Narratives&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Crowell%2C+Jamison+Curtis&amp;isbn=9781303538063&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Chinese Latinization Movement, 1917–1958: Language, History and Politics","This dissertation examines Chinese Latinization as an anti-illiteracy movement launched by Chinese communists and leftwing intellectuals in the crucial period during which the nature of the Chinese language was vigorously debated in relation to national liberation and social revolution. Critical scholarship tends to consider this campaign for alphabetic writing based on the Latin alphabet a “failure” as the state-builders of the People’s Republic of China in the 1950s indefinitely postponed the Latinizing goal. This study does not begin from the predetermined result of a “failure,” and instead reveals the multivocal voices, intellectual energies and political conflicts engaged by Chinese Latinizers in their struggles for mass literacy and national language in a global context. By imagining the lived experience of literacy learners, language workers and creative writers in specific oppositional moments of Chinese Latinization, this project illuminates a vital dynamic of Chinese nationalism as it was articulated in particular local, regional and global conjunctures. Chapter one engages an analysis of the internationalist aspirations of Chinese Latinization amidst the simultaneous rise of nationalism and socialism in the non-western world during the 1930s. Chapter two traces diachronically the abstract ideology of national language as it was developed from the late Qing imperial reforms through to the May Fourth movement in the late 1910s and the 1920s. Chapter three explicates the turn Soviet Latinization took when it arrived and was debated in China. I argue that the ethnicization of linguistic differences in Soviet Latinization became the verbalization of intra-national, regional social forces in the advocacy of “ fangyan Latinization” in China. Through a case-study of Huang Guliu’s The Story of Shrimp-ball , chapter four examines the persistence of regional writers, who produced popular literature in Chinese characters, contrary to the promotion of Latinizing regional varieties of Chinese in the same period. This chapter is followed by an epilogue in which I suggest that we try to discover similarities where none are apparent and to find differences where things appear to be similar, in a new comparative paradigm that takes seriously the global constitution of China.",1468687398,,Dissertations & Theses," Wong, Chi ManWongManChiWong, Chi Man",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3158557701 , 81758312 , 66569 , 9781303559914 , 3602754 , 3602754", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303559914, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1468687398?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0679 Language"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0679 Language"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0679 Language",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0679 Language"," Comparative literature , Asian Studies , Language"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , China , Hong Kong and topolect literature , Huang, Guliu , Language reform , Literacy campaign , Nationalism and socialism , Romanization , Sinophone literature",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Chinese+Latinization+Movement%2C+1917%E2%80%931958%3A+Language%2C+History+and+Politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wong%2C+Chi+Man&amp;isbn=9781303559914&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Critical individuals in dynamic population networks,"Diffusion of contaminants, diseases, rumors, fads, and many other dynamic processes typically take place through a network of interacting entities. One fundamental question in the context of diffusion, particularly in social networks is: which entities in a network are critical for a given diffusion process? For instance, these critical entities could be individuals to whom free products should be given in a network so that the adoption of the product is maximized. Or, individuals in a population who should be vaccinated so that the spread of a virus or a contaminant is minimized. Or, leaders in a network that are critical for initiating a mass movement. In my research, I address the question of finding critical individuals for diffusion in networks in the context of network theory, graph mining, machine learning, and social network analysis. My research focuses on two complimentary optimization goals: maximization and minimization of the extent of the resulting extent of diffusion. For diffusion maximization, I analyze: 1. the hardness of diffusion maximization in dynamic networks; 2. the impact of structural changes in prediction of diffusion in networks; 3. the global structural indicators for measuring the effectiveness of various diffusion maximization methods in both static and dynamic networks. For diffusion minimization, I develop simple, practical, and locally computable heuristics for identifying critical nodes in dynamic networks. In this work, I study explicitly dynamic or time evolving networks instead of traditional static or aggregate representation of networks. Lastly, for rigorous analysis of the stochastic diffusion optimization problem, realistic network generative models are very crucial. I present a truly dynamic statistical generative network model that captures membership, formation, and fluidity of community membership and the resulting structure of interactions.",1468954452,,Dissertations & Theses," Habiba, HabibaHabibaHabibaHabiba, Habiba",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3159841431 , 81803562 , 66569 , 9781303596193 , 3604225 , 3604225", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303596193, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1468954452?accountid=14496, 0984 Computer science, 0984 Computer science, 0984 Computer science,, 0984 Computer science, Computer science," Applied sciences , Diffusion , Graph mining , Network theory , Population networks , Social network analysis",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Critical+individuals+in+dynamic+population+networks&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Habiba%2C+Habiba&amp;isbn=9781303596193&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Community of non-belonging, bodies for non-philosophy: Interncultural performance and a sense of coexistence","This dissertation studies music and stage performances led by contemporary Japanese minority groups, primarily Ainu activists, from three theoretical perspectives: 1. Politics of representation, 2. The body and materiality, and 3. Philosophy of difference. Each perspective informs each chapter’s study of the soundscape and performance produced in lieu of verbal political negotiation. Posed as a project in performance studies and critical race theory, the dissertation analyzes cultural and political contexts of each performance as well as affect of the impact of performance. By addressing political situations and history minority populations in Japan, and especially since most of the chapters address the issues of contemporary Ainu indigenous struggles, this project necessarily takes postcolonial and feminist approaches that criticize Japanese imperialism, colonialism, and ideological products of other disciplinary forms of nation-building, such as the social hierarchies based on race and gender. The performances introduced in this dissertation themselves, however, take remarkably positive approaches to conceiving differences of the bodies. Rather than reverting to traditional identity politics, their performance activism seeks a new way for the various bodies and sensations to occupy shared spaces. Thus by examining their inclusive politics that is marked by avoidance of political discussions and focus on the sound elements and music sensations to activate a space of coexistence, this dissertation explores how music and bodily sensations allow us to conceive new modes of coexistence by different bodies of people. Another question this dissertation pursues is how to conceive materiality of the body while many gender and cultural studies have studied the body as signs and symbols of identity, and not a corporeal substance. By aligning with the recent theoretical movement that focuses on the material body, this dissertation engages in theorization of the body that leverages innovative conceptualizations of living with others. Finally, the dissertation proposes the concept of “Transnational Indigeneity,” an indigenous theorization that locates indigeneity outside and beyond national and racial borders and critiques such imperial exclusions and markings of bodies and the earth. The dissertation describes how transnational indigeneity is materialized in the new Ainu collaborative music scenes through the sound and sensations.",1476908392,,Dissertations & Theses," Tamura, YurikaTamuraYurikaTamura, Yurika",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3179966971 , 77814182 , 66569 , 9781303637322 , 3606569 , 3606569", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303637322, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1476908392?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0422 Philosophy , 0465 Theater , 0733 Gender studies"," 0413 Music , 0422 Philosophy , 0465 Theater , 0733 Gender studies"," 0413 Music , 0422 Philosophy , 0465 Theater , 0733 Gender studies",," 0413 Music , 0422 Philosophy , 0465 Theater , 0733 Gender studies"," Music , Philosophy , Theater , Gender studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Ainu , Grosz , Japanese minority groups , Peroformance , Zainichi",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Community+of+non-belonging%2C+bodies+for+non-philosophy%3A+Interncultural+performance+and+a+sense+of+coexistence&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tamura%2C+Yurika&amp;isbn=9781303637322&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Ecology of coyotes on the Valles Caldera National Preserve, New Mexico: Implications for elk calf recruitment","An understanding of coyote ( Canis latrans ) ecology was critical to developing management plans on the nascent Valles Caldera National Preserve (VCNP) in northern New Mexico. Managers concerned about low elk ( Cervus elaphus ) recruitment also observed a concomitant increase in sightings of coyotes and observations of coyote predation on elk calves. The goals of this study were to describe food habits and spatial and social ecology of coyotes on VCNP, particularly as related to ecological interactions with elk. Our objectives were to identify, quantify, and assess the temporal variation in coyote diet, to describe coyote home-range size and habitat use, to describe coyote movements within and outside of packs, and to evaluate the relationship between coyote social cohesion and the amount of elk in the coyote diet. We examined coyote food habits via monthly scat analysis (n = 1,385 scats). The most frequent taxa were rodents (predominantly Microtus spp. and Thomomys talpoides ), elk (adult and calf), insects (Orthoptera and Coleoptera), lagomorph ( Sylvilagus nuttallii ), and plants. Most food types varied significantly seasonally and annually. Variation in climatic variables and relative abundance or vulnerability of food items may explain the diet variation of coyotes observed. We examined global positioning system (GPS) and triangulation location data from 33 coyotes. We classified 23 coyotes (70%) as residents during at least part of the study and 10 coyotes (30%) as consistently transient. Mean home-range size was 11.0 ± 2.6 (SD) km 2 and varied significantly between packs but did not vary by season or year. Coyotes used dry and wet meadow habitats in proportion to availability; coyotes used riparian habitat more than expected and forests less than expected. Social cohesion did not vary by biological season. Alpha coyotes were more socially cohesive with each other than with their pack associate, and a transient exhibited temporal-spatial avoidance of pack members while inside the pack's home range followed by integration into the pack. We found no relationship between coyote social cohesion and the proportion of elk in coyote diets. We concluded that coyote sociality on the VCNP was relatively stable year-round despite changes in biological needs and prey size.",1492736762,,Dissertations & Theses," Gifford, Suzanne J.GiffordJ.SuzanneGifford, Suzanne J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3195764501 , 79247002 , 66569 , 9781303641640 , 1550151 , 1550151", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303641640, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1492736762?accountid=14496," 0286 Wildlife Management , 0329 Ecology , 0528 Natural Resource Management"," 0286 Wildlife Management , 0329 Ecology , 0528 Natural Resource Management"," 0286 Wildlife Management , 0329 Ecology , 0528 Natural Resource Management",," 0286 Wildlife Management , 0329 Ecology , 0528 Natural Resource Management"," Wildlife Management , Ecology , Natural Resource Management"," Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Canis latrans , Food habits , Habitat use , Home range , Social ecology , Valles caldera national preserve",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Ecology+of+coyotes+on+the+Valles+Caldera+National+Preserve%2C+New+Mexico%3A+Implications+for+elk+calf+recruitment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gifford%2C+Suzanne+J.&amp;isbn=9781303641640&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"&lt;i&gt;Spycy&lt;/i&gt; shores invite the eyes: Towards a multidisciplinary visual theory of food,"Scholars studying images of food continue to use the framework of social construction (Adema, Hansen, LeBesco and Naccarato, Probyn, Theophano, Warnes, Williams-Forson) even as more complex theories have emerged (Cilliers, Hayles, Massumi, Taylor). Since systems of images cut across cultural boundaries, this project seeks to establish a multi-disciplinary theory of food using the resources of complex systems theory, visual studies, feminist theory, cultural studies, postcolonial theory, Latina/o studies, African American studies, and food studies. Examining five different patterns of interaction characteristic of complex systems, I describe the emergence and evolution of a complex species of food image that I call spyce, defined as the worldmaking interface among food, images, and interpretants. This tripartite model underscores my argument that images of food arise from interaction among disparate actors rather than directly in an unmediated way from individual, autonomous producers. I first describe how early modern English writers imaged the global spice trade. Their imaginative acts contributed to a process of emergence, qualitatively changing the commodity of spice into the visualizing instrument of spyce. Subsequent chapters address four more patterns that give rise to spyce : the visual intensive continuums that generate images of food, place, and race in nineteenth-century cookbooks; the distributed topology of food images at the local, regional, and global scales, as illustrated in Cherríe Moraga's play Watsonville (2002); the embodiment of food images in food-based literature by Maya Angelou, Isabel Allende, and Chitra Divakaruni; the enaction of alliances at the personal scale through the Slow Food movement's design strategies.",1496773079,,Dissertations & Theses," Schwegler, LawrenceSchweglerLawrenceSchwegler, Lawrence",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3213965481 , 85381372 , 66569 , 9781303652400 , 3607621 , 3607621", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303652400, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1496773079?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0359 Food Science"," 0298 Modern literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0359 Food Science"," 0298 Modern literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0359 Food Science",," 0298 Modern literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0359 Food Science"," Modern literature , Cultural anthropology , Food Science"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Biological sciences , Complex , Cookbooks , Food , Images , Representation , Slow Food movement , Systems , Visual",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Spycy+shores+invite+the+eyes%3A+Towards+a+multidisciplinary+visual+theory+of+food&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schwegler%2C+Lawrence&amp;isbn=9781303652400&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Over the Pacific: Post-World War II Asian American internationalism,"This dissertation examines the ways in which Asian American internationalism developed in the post-World War II Pacific Rim. Defining Asian American internationalism as the agendas advanced by Asian Americans regarding foreign affairs, countries, and peoples in the Pacific Rim, I attempt to understand Asian Americans' ideas and activities in various occasions and ways, such as: organizing demonstrations on the street; interacting with peoples in Asia; producing art work; expressing opinions in various media outlets; and intervening in foreign policy making. My dissertation investigates the ways in which Japanese and Chinese Americans viewed, imagined, connected themselves with, and worked on the affairs, countries, and peoples of East Asia as well as U.S. foreign policies in the post-World War II period. Drawing on the concept of identity formation, I use two ideal types of internationalism in my analysis. The first type of internationalism emerges out of the diaspora's social field which connects the homeland to place(s) of settlement through such forms as political commitment, imagination, memory, travel and cultural production. The second type is Third World internationalism which was forged in the Asian American movement in the late 1960s and early 1970s. By utilizing these two types of internationalism, I discuss significant cases in developments of postwar Asian American internationalism, such as: Japanese Americans' political stakes in Cold War politics in the late 1950s; Asian American movement activists' intervention into U.S. foreign policy on the cusp of the 1960s and 1970s; and Asian Americans' commitment to the politics of memory of World War II in the 1990s and 2000s. In its examination of the trajectory of post-World War II Asian American internationalism in both the domestic and international arenas, my dissertation contributes to the development of both U.S. history and Asian American studies. While many U.S. historians have emphasized the importance of placing U.S. history in global contexts and grasping historical phenomena from a relational viewpoint, Asian Americanists also have turned in the same direction with emphasis on the trans-Pacific movement of people, ideas, goods, and money, particularly in light of the large number of immigrants from Asia that has vastly increased since the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. As the first investigation of developments of post-World War II Asian American internationalism, my dissertation contributes to critical discussions that are currently taking place across multiple academic fields.",1497284031,,Dissertations & Theses," Oyagi, GoOyagiGoOyagi, Go",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3216713291 , 80490452 , 66569 , 9781303694523 , 3609977 , 3609977", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303694523, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1497284031?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0601 International Relations"," 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0601 International Relations",," 0337 American history , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0601 International Relations"," American history , Asian American Studies , International Relations"," Social sciences , Asia , International relations , Internationalism , Post-World War II , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Over+the+Pacific%3A+Post-World+War+II+Asian+American+internationalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Oyagi%2C+Go&amp;isbn=9781303694523&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Shipping Container and the Globalization of American Infrastructure,"Over the past few decades the transportation infrastructure of the United States has been globalized by the shipping container, an object that carries vast amounts of global commerce. Best known for traveling over the ocean, the container's ability to move in trucking and railroad infrastructures is equally crucial. As its intermodal capability allows for easy transfer between transport modes without its contents being loaded and unloaded, a container is able to follow a global trajectory through the use of multiple infrastructures. Consequently the domestic American transportation system has been integrated into the worldwide network of containerized freight movement. The American trucking and railroad systems have moved containers since the 1920s, and larger modern containers since the 1950s. Paralleling the dramatic rise in global trade, in recent decades the container has been widely carried by these two domestic infrastructures, and has also traveled on inland waterways sporadically. Trucking and railroads have been altered in many ways by containerization, both in terms of the necessary equipment and the routes of movement. Furthermore, the container's proliferation in the U.S. transportation network has necessitated the development of intermodal terminals, large facilities at key junctions of road and rail where containers are transferred from one transport mode to another. Yet the U.S. national infrastructure has kept many of its longstanding characteristics, for the container does not replace or transform it but rather depends upon it. The container's impact is substantial and results in some important changes, as American transportation systems must accommodate its physical qualities and other characteristics, but the fundamental nature of domestic infrastructure generally remains in place.

The way the container impacts American transportation, therefore, is deeply affected by the historical, geographic, social and political realities of the nation and its infrastructure.

It involves three histories: of Peru, China, and the interactions that brought the two together during a period marked by the simultaneous processes of globalization and nation-making. In particular, it explores how these histories were brought together by the movement of migrants through these spaces, by the articulations of Chinese identities and nationalisms across these spaces, and by the development of governance practices to facilitate and discipline migrant lives as they moved back and forth across the Pacific and took up residence in new communities. Peruvian Chinese, through their participation in the making of a network of Chinese communities across the Pacific, contributed to the emergence of China and Peru as modern nation-states, and to the formation of East Asia, Latin America and the Pacific as modern geo-political and economic regions. By examining the case of Chinese in Peru, this study takes up the problem of the simultaneous expansion and fragmentation of Chinese spaces across the Pacific, and investigates the work involved in the making of Chinese communities defined in relation to both the territorialized nation-state and the migrant subject. This study uses translocal, regional and global historical research methodologies to examine Chinese migration from the Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong Province in China to the northern coastal regions of Peru. By examining how the social transformations affecting south China from the mid-19th to early 20th century shaped the abilities of Chinese in Peru to cope with the rapidly shifting social environment on the other side of the Pacific, this dissertation demonstrates how modes of governance that developed in the south China region became resources Chinese migrants in Peru used to organize and govern a transpacific migrant community in Peru from the late-19th to the mid-20th centuries.",1498555708,,Dissertations & Theses," Candela, Ana MariaCandelaMariaAnaCandela, Ana Maria",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3220776121 , 83202752 , 66569 , 9781303687136 , 3609643 , 3609643", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303687136, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1498555708?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0342 Asian Studies , 0343 Asian American Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0342 Asian Studies , 0343 Asian American Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0342 Asian Studies , 0343 Asian American Studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0342 Asian Studies , 0343 Asian American Studies"," Latin American history , Asian Studies , Asian American Studies"," Social sciences , Chinese nationalism , Governance , Migrations , Nationalism , Overseas chinese , Peru",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nation%2C+migration+and+governance%3A+Cantonese+migrants+to+Peru+and+the+making+of+overseas+Chinese+nationalism%2C+1849-2013&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Candela%2C+Ana+Maria&amp;isbn=9781303687136&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""From pacifism to nonviolent direct action: The fellowship of reconciliation and social Christianity, 1914-1947","This project traces the development of Christian nonviolence in the United States from the outbreak of World War I until just after World War II by focusing on one Christian pacifist organization. The Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR), organized in 1915 in opposition to World War I, embraced the left wing of the prewar social gospel and fused its radical vision for social reconstruction with their opposition to war. Over the next thirty years, Christian pacifists associated with the Fellowship applied their energies not only to ending international war but also to promoting reconciliation between employers and workers in the struggle for labor justice and ending racial discrimination. During this period, advocates of nonviolence struggled to define a practical means for applying the principles of Christian pacifism. In contrast to older histories of the interwar period, this study shows that pacifism, a central concern for liberal Protestants during that period, shaped the broader American tradition of dissent. It also rejects the notion that the Christian ""realists,"" led by Reinhold Niebuhr, offered the only comprehensive Christian social ethic between the wars. Finally, this dissertation shows how Christian pacifists in the interwar period embraced and adapted the principles Gandhian nonviolence to the American scene. Members of the Fellowship founded the Congress of Racial Equality in Chicago in 1942 and developed methods of nonviolent direct action that were adopted by advocates for racial equality during the Civil Rights Movement of the 1950s and 1960s..",1500435448,,Dissertations & Theses," Ballou, Andrew J.BallouJ.AndrewBallou, Andrew J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3223069671 , 80581202 , 66569 , 9781303702426 , 3610449 , 3610449", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303702426, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1500435448?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," Religious history , American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Christianity , Civil rights movement , Gandhi , Nonviolence , Pacifism , Social gospel",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=From+pacifism+to+nonviolent+direct+action%3A+The+fellowship+of+reconciliation+and+social+Christianity%2C+1914-1947&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ballou%2C+Andrew+J.&amp;isbn=9781303702426&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A rhetoric of home: Place, identity, and human rights in immigrant women's life writing in the United States","Even though autobiography is a predominant means of writing for immigrants, few critical studies focus on works written by female immigrants, especially by non-European immigrants and immigrant women of color. The existing studies on any immigrant autobiography focus on individual authors, titles, ethnic groups, or themes. My cross-cultural, comparative analysis of life writing by non-European immigrant women in the U.S. establishes a theory about female immigrants' autobiographies that revolutionizes immigrant life writing studies, which have been based upon Europeanized immigrant stories of white, Western culture of privilege. This dissertation argues that non-European immigrant women adapt prevalent life writing models to create an autobiographical form that is independent of nationality. By analyzing the memoirs of an undocumented Mexican woman, a female Korean adoptee, and a female Iranian immigrant, my study shows how these women critique gender oppression, demand education as a human right, and promote citizenship laws that eschew racial and cultural differentiation. The texts reveal female perspectives of history and immigration processes, which oppose patriarchal hierarchies. Non-European immigrant women perform an essential kind of sociocultural work, explaining social environments and cultural traditions to a wider audience, which actual human rights legislation is incapable of doing. Their memoirs position readers as witnesses to the injustices and dislocations that these women have experienced. Through creating empathy for oppressed groups, their life writing does not only serve as a source of information for decision-makers but can change public human rights and immigration discourse more broadly. My theoretical approach is interdisciplinary, building on research in Women's and Gender Studies, Ethnic Studies, Sociology, and Political Science. This dissertation demonstrates that the analysis of female immigrants' life writing extends approaches by the Social Sciences to understanding people's transnational movements. It reveals immigrant women's political agenda, alleviates ignorance about their lives, and generates a more comprehensive assessment of non-European women's migration processes.",1501448869,,Dissertations & Theses," Seethaler, Ina C.SeethalerC.InaSeethaler, Ina C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3227691951 , 80906872 , 66569 , 9781303714146 , 3611053 , 3611053", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303714146, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1501448869?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0304 Biographies , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0304 Biographies , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0304 Biographies , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0298 Modern literature , 0304 Biographies , 0453 Womens studies , 0615 Political science , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Modern literature , Biographies , Womens studies , Political science , Ethnic studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Gender , Human rights , Life writing , Migration",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+rhetoric+of+home%3A+Place%2C+identity%2C+and+human+rights+in+immigrant+women%27s+life+writing+in+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Seethaler%2C+Ina+C.&amp;isbn=9781303714146&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A Seamless Garment of Eco-Justice: Green Sisters in Kansas,"Catholic sisters fuse long-standing, creation-oriented theology, the new story presented by science, and Catholic social justice teachings into a seamless garment of social justice and solid activism.

While not as visible as the black-robed nuns of the past, sisters are still at the forefront of social change, standing up for the `least of all people,' and filling the needs of society.

Amerindians from Alaska to Chile are increasingly raising their voices and reclaiming the right to represent themselves, in both a political and a discursive sense. This boom in indigenous literature and social movements is arguably one of the most significant occurrences at the turn of the twenty-first century, yet it remains largely understudied on a comparative level. This dissertation seeks to address that gap by expanding the possibilities for North-South dialogue and exploring the commonalities and particularities of different movements across both continents. By critically adopting native activists’ use of the term Abya Yala—meaning “Continent of Plenitude and Maturity” in the Kuna language of Panama—I explore alternative conceptions of space and place that impart a powerful starting point for rethinking comparative, inter-American work through the lens of indigenous studies. Central to this inquiry is the concept of insurgent poetics, which I introduce to convey a mode of writing that narrates and/or performs acts of resistance and partakes in the struggle for political and intellectual sovereignty. Through an analysis of several novels, essays, and poetry collections from Guatemala, Mexico, Colombia/Venezuela, the Southwestern United States, and Bolivia, I demonstrate that literature constitutes a key weapon in indigenous social movements, as it provides a means of rendering subjugated knowledges visible ( visibilizar ) and of envisioning alternatives to modernity/coloniality ( visualizar ). Given that this process of revitalization represents a struggle for autonomy in what is ultimately a poetic (re)creation of the self, I contend that insurgency represents not only the negation of oppression, coloniality, neoliberalism, or the dominant classes (as the case may be), but also the affirmation of possible alternatives to the dominant power structures and systems of knowledge. Contemporary indigenous insurgency thus represents a form cultural resurgence, an emergence into the scene of global politics, and an in-surgence into the sphere of lettered culture and State power.",1512225944,,Dissertations & Theses," Burdette, HannahBurdetteHannahBurdette, Hannah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264252371 , 81754242 , 66569 , 9781303779282 , 3585438 , 3585438", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303779282, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512225944?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0591 American literature , 0740 Native American studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0591 American literature , 0740 Native American studies"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0591 American literature , 0740 Native American studies",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0591 American literature , 0740 Native American studies"," Latin American literature , American literature , Native American studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Cultural revitalization , Decolonization , Indigenous literature , Inter-American studies , Kuna language , North-South dialogue",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Insurgent+poetics%3A+Literature+and+alternative+textualities+in+contemporary+Abya+Yala&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burdette%2C+Hannah&amp;isbn=9781303779282&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Crafting solutions in Tajikistan: How the fair trade market can empower the abandoned wives of labor migrants,"One million men travel from Tajikistan to Russia every year to find work. Low wages and racial discrimination prevent many laborers from obtaining a substantial income for their families. Meanwhile, the migrant wives back in Tajikistan are likely to face economic and psychological hurdles. Many of the women who are abandoned by their husbands might try to economically sustain themselves through unhealthy survival methods such as polygamy or prostitution. This thesis explores how implementing fair trade into Tajik society can benefit divorced or widowed migrant wives in the country's slow economy. The fair trade movement allows disadvantaged individuals in developing countries to produce and sell traditional handcrafts on an international market that guarantees fair wages and safe working conditions. Tajik artisans have already made efforts to sustain themselves through the production of crafts, but fair trade companies have not made any efforts to work in the country. If women from Tajikistan were given the opportunity to participate in this movement, they can join a wide network of artisans, advocates, and shoppers who share the common goal of creating social change. They would also be able to pay their children's school fees, ensure that their communities have safe drinking water, and keep their families financially stable. Most importantly, fair trade will help to shrink the economic gap between men and women and give abandoned wives the independence they need to stand on their own.",1517934029,,Dissertations & Theses," Lombardi, ThereseLombardiThereseLombardi, Therese",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3280711981 , 80580182 , 66569 , 9781303834844 , 1525170 , 1525170", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303834844, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1517934029?accountid=14496, 0453 Womens studies, 0453 Womens studies, 0453 Womens studies,, 0453 Womens studies, Womens studies," Social sciences , Fair Trade , Labor Migration , Russia , Tajikistan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Crafting+solutions+in+Tajikistan%3A+How+the+fair+trade+market+can+empower+the+abandoned+wives+of+labor+migrants&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lombardi%2C+Therese&amp;isbn=9781303834844&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Fragile civility: An evangelical american school meets korean educational sojourners in neoliberal time,"This study is situated in the burgeoning body of scholarship on South Korea’s “Early Study Abroad” (ESA) movement and English hegemony and bilingual education, and in the larger narrative of global educational migration, especially the integration of international students into U.S. schools. It examines the conflicts that emerged when a noncompetitive evangelical Midwestern Christian high school, predominantly white lower-middle class, enrolled escalating numbers of Early Study Abroad (ESA) Korean teenagers. It focuses on the importance of language, in particular the emergence of English as today’s lingua franca, in terms of integration as opposed to assimilation. The school implemented polices regarding the use of English–Only at school and guardianship of those students who were unaccompanied by parents. During three years of ethnographic interviews and observations of fourteen upper-middle class 10th-12th grade Korean students (nine male and five female), their parents, and school personnel, both at the school and outside of the school (in the U.S. and in Korea), I asked how those policies came into being and how various groups of students, teachers, administrators, and parents viewed them, and why they had these views. I observed what the effects of the policies actually were, in practice. Examination of these policies provided a window into uncomfortable, underlying, and unstated incompatibilities among the educational and social goals and expectations of the Korean students, their parents, and the school’s staff and leadership. A veneer of civility hid from the various parties – students, parents, and school staff – their diverging goals and viewpoints. Their reactions were further convoluted with linguistic, religious, racial/ethnic issues, as well as class, citizenship, and identity. The fraught experiences that resulted suggested that neither the Korean ESA families nor the school staff were prepared for the conflict that resulted from linguistic, racial, and class differences. Using constant-comparative cross case analysis in an iterative manner, I looked for themes within and across the individuals and the groups and formulated analysis codes. The discourses surrounding the issues reflected the values and goals and power relationships of the various parties concerned. These discourses each had a history that needed to be examined. Therefore, I paid particular attention to how power relations around the policies were structured, constructed, and rationalized in the daily practice of schooling. I relate these observations to how such mechanisms of power were utilized, complicated, and transferred by the anonymous workings of global hegemonic domination. Further, I explore how the Korean students’ cross-border educational experiences contributed to their evolving senses of self, to their constitution of their subjectivity. Major findings are: (1) Mismatched goals, motivations, and expectations existed between the Koreans and the school. The Koreans were seeking to acquire human capital via English competence, eventual credentialing from American higher educational institutions, and the acquisition of the tools of world citizenship; the school sought to develop individuals with strong Christian values in a climate of multicultural tolerance of diversity. Both visions seemed to be integrationist, but in practice led to conflict: The Korean students found the school conservative and academically mediocre, and felt treated as a “foreign” minority; the school found the Koreans excessively concerned with grades, clannish, and unethical (perceived to be cheating, lying, and showing lack of respect). (2). Instead of recognizing and acknowledging the underlying mismatch of goals, however, the school attributed its problems with the Korean students to their lack of guardianship and of sufficient commitment to Christianity. The Koreans, in turn, attributed their problems at the school to its academic mediocrity, conservativeness, and lack of teaching skills. (3). Despite its acceptance by Korean parents and school officials and even to a large extent by the students themselves, the English-Only policy neither facilitated Korean students’ English learning nor enhanced the school’s unity. It operated primarily as a policing mechanism that unconsciously highlighted suspicions and prejudices on all sides. While the school considered language neutral yet a critical medium for the transmission of Christian benevolence for students and their parents, English-only spoke to a racialized and Christian-inflected American hegemony. The school’s desire to integrate a diverse population was undercut by their policy of English-Only. The English-Only policy neither served pedagogically nor did it serve for integration. (4). The school considered living with a guardian or just one parent (typically the mother) an unsatisfactory living arrangement that violated their religious principles and led to parental neglect and lack of discipline. The Koreans accepted family separation as a sacrifice they needed to make to help their children achieve international mobility and future economic success. (5) Racism on all sides played roles that were not recognized by the parties involved. The Korean students brought with them U.S. racial ideology favoring white values, learned at home through past U.S. influence in Korea; the school’s English-Only policy unconsciously reinforced those racist tendencies. (6) Individual Korean children learned to become foreigners at the school in different ways; responses to the school’s policies, survival strategies, and choices of ethnic/racial/national identification varied considerably. While the majority adopted a rebellious stance by joining largely homogenous Korean social groups, some adopted an “honor white” attitude. But from a global economic perspective, choices related to strategic identity—such as choice of nationality, language mastery, and future location— were somewhat uniform among the Korean students. They chose what they believed will be beneficial in becoming entrepreneurs of themselves, and their choice was the self of enterprise, a neoliberal homo economicus as a personal and familiar investment strategy.",1517974336,,Dissertations & Theses," Park, Hye-YoungParkHye-YoungPark, Hye-Young",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3280747791 , 87005182 , 66569 , 9781303802751 , 3614674 , 3614674", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303802751, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1517974336?accountid=14496," 0282 Bilingual education , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0530 Teacher education"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0530 Teacher education"," 0282 Bilingual education , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0530 Teacher education",," 0282 Bilingual education , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0530 Teacher education"," Bilingual education , English as a Second Language , Teacher education"," Education , Education fever , Educational dilemma in south korea , Educational migration as upper middle class family strategies , English fever , Korean spirit , Maternal zeal",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fragile+civility%3A+An+evangelical+american+school+meets+korean+educational+sojourners+in+neoliberal+time&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Park%2C+Hye-Young&amp;isbn=9781303802751&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Shanghaization of Mumbai: Vsions, displacements, contestations","A central question in the field of global studies is how does the development planning of emerging economies address social inequality? The emerging economies have achieved remarkable economic success in recent years; however, this success has also accompanied new challenges of mega-urbanization, new rural and urban poverty and inequality. This has prompted a reexamination of the growth strategies in countries such as India and China who have made “inclusive growth” as their central goal of development planning. In the context of inclusive growth, urban development has emerged as a key problematic that seeks to balance high growth and reduction in poverty and inequality. Growth has fueled national ambitions for increasing power in world politics and the global market and cities are viewed as key actors in sustaining this growth. In this context, growth gets normalized, masking its inequities, unevenness, and contestations. Therefore, any serious discussion about inclusive growth in emerging economies has to take into account the complex urban realities within these societies and the challenges involved in making growth inclusive. Taking Mumbai—India’s “global city”—as a case, this dissertation explores competing claims of urban development among diverse stakeholders in the city (including planners, business associations, civic organizations, activists, and poor peoples’ movements) in the context of the recent national growth strategy in India that gives primacy to cities. I analyze the genealogies of emerging local (urban) development imaginaries, modeled after “successful” Asian cities, particularly Shanghai. In doing so, I focus on the processes, actors, visions, and practices that constitute and contest these urbanization strategies. The study was based on twelve months of field work (archival research, interviews, and ethnographic observation) in Mumbai. The study contributes in problematizing taken-for-granted assumptions of growth in the emerging economies and calls for broad-based inclusive development that focuses on the quality and welfare implications of growth. Some of the key findings of the study are: ~Shanghaization as an urban growth strategy was produced and sustained by a constellation of actors operating at multiple scales involving the corporate sector, the national and subnational state, and the urban middle classes. ~As a model of development, Shanghaization is narrowly focused on growth rather than broad-based development. As an entrepreneurial model, it privileges the urban middle-classes and does not address structural poverty and inequality in the city. ~Shanghaization is not merely a metropolitan imaginary, but has emerged as a national urban-centric model of development in India that is premised on uneven development. ~By challenging the narrow economic assumptions in development thinking, the poor people’s movements in the city open up possibilities for ground-up, broad-based developmental alternatives that are equitable and sustainable.",1517975157,,Dissertations & Theses," Ghadge, RaviGhadgeRaviGhadge, Ravi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3280747961 , 87005252 , 66569 , 9781303801914 , 3614587 , 3614587", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303801914, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1517975157?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0999 Urban planning"," 0344 Social research , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0999 Urban planning"," 0344 Social research , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0999 Urban planning",," 0344 Social research , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0999 Urban planning"," Social research , South Asian Studies , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Bombay , Globalization , Inclusive growth , India , Mumbai , Urban development , Urban sociology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Shanghaization+of+Mumbai%3A+Vsions%2C+displacements%2C+contestations&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ghadge%2C+Ravi&amp;isbn=9781303801914&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Embodying &lt;i&gt;asana&lt;/i&gt; in All New Places: Transformational Ethics, Yoga Tourism and Sensual Awakenings","Yoga has been an organizing feature of community for thousands of years, shaping and being shaped by the bodies, minds, spiritual worlds and social relationships of its practitioners. Over the course of the last century, it has become a global celebrity-endorsed exemplification of how to live a “good” life and been transformed from the “exotic,” grotesque menageries of ascetic “sinister yogis” and itinerant sages, to define the fit, graceful, radiant, blissful personages of American supermodels and pop-stars. Yoga has moved from the ashrams of India to gyms, church basements and specialized studios of Europe, North America and Australia, and from these centers of economic and political power, to “exotic” peripheries through the global and bodily movements of world-travelers seeking self-discovery, health, spiritual transformation, and connection with the natural world in “less developed” locales. This dissertation explores and documents the movement of yoga-motivated travelers to tourism locales with no historical connection to yoga, asking questions about 1) how yoga travelers’ activities fit in larger contexts of ethical tourism and cross-cultural consumption as yoga travels across borders, 2) the role yoga plays in practitioners’ lives, shaping health, gender, sexuality, and lifestyle, 3) outcomes of sustained contemporary yoga practice on the bodies of practitioners, including affective transformation through bodily manipulation, the expansion of sensual awareness through breath, auditory techniques, meditation and mind-body synthesis, 4) how these bodily transformations are interpreted and applied to contemporary life through syncretic adaptations of yoga ethics from classical yoga texts with contemporary ethical discourses of environmentalism and consumer choice, and 5) how yoga tourists and the owners of yoga tourism locales view, interact with, and mobilize “foreign” locals and locales through sustainable development narratives and ideas of global community and universal spirituality. I apply contemporary anthropological agendas to yoga as a means to explore different ways of being alive, paying particular attention to how sensual potentials are brought to conscious experience by relational engagement with nature and culture, thus shaping our affective worlds. This dissertation charts intimate bodily and cross-cultural human relationships played out through yoga. It considers the spiritual, economic, political and cultural impacts of globalized yoga and yoga tourism. Close attention is paid to the experiential aspects of yoga and how yoga enlivens and relates to larger social narratives of nature sanctity under contemporary stresses of neoliberalism, including how yoga practitioners engage with the ethics of yoga and consumption to make lifestyle choices that align with political and economic concerns for viable ecological, social and cultural futures.",1520025483,,Dissertations & Theses," Lalonde, Angelique Maria GabrielleLalondeMaria GabrielleAngeliqueLalonde, Angelique Maria Gabrielle",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3289945101 , 87236062 , 66569 , 9780499283818 , NS28381 , NS28381", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9780499283818, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1520025483?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0814 Recreation"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0814 Recreation"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0814 Recreation",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0814 Recreation"," Cultural anthropology , Recreation"," Social sciences , Lifestyles , Posthumanism , Tourism , Yoga",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Embodying+asana+in+All+New+Places%3A+Transformational+Ethics%2C+Yoga+Tourism+and+Sensual+Awakenings&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lalonde%2C+Angelique+Maria+Gabrielle&amp;isbn=9780499283818&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Educating the globe: Foreign students and cultural exchange at Tuskegee Institute, 1898-1935","This dissertation offers a comprehensive and comparative analysis of foreign students at Tuskegee Institute between 1892 and 1935. During this time, aspiring young people from the Caribbean, Africa, and Asia coalesced on the rural Alabama campus, creating a unique cultural space. It became a space not only for intellectual exchange, but also for cultural pride, political solidarity, and global exchange. Although much has been written about the school’s founder, Booker T. Washington, very little has been written about the role his school played in forging and sustaining a global community. This dissertation charts the cultural, historical, and contextual significance of Tuskegee’s foreign students as they traveled overseas to the tumultuous Jim Crow South. The rise of political intimidation and physical violence against African Americans during the early part of the twentieth century coincided with the emergence of European colonialism and American imperialism abroad. As people of African descent disproportionately found themselves under oppressive social, economic, and political conditions, Tuskegee Institute emerged as a cultural and intellectual safe haven for both American born and foreign students. Foreign scholars and activists such as Jose Marti, Juan Gomez, J. A. Aggrey, Pambini Mzimba, and Marcus Garvey used Tuskegee as a symbol of Black Nationalism, political solidarity, borrowing their methods to uplift darker peoples of the world. The cultural and intellectual exchange that took place at Tuskegee set in motion a long history of African American, African, and Asian interaction. This study traces the evolution of Washington and Tuskegee as they used education to combat racial, political, and economic disenfranchisement forging a global community in the process. A critical survey of the diverse experiences of students from Puerto Rico, Cuba, the Anglophone Caribbean, Liberia, South Africa, Japan, China, and India as they appeared on the small rural campus in Tuskegee, Alabama sheds light into the process of the creation of a global community. This study examines how foreign students resisted cultural assimilation, struggled with migration, experienced American racism, and embraced national sensibilities, all while receiving an education. Furthermore, examining the experience of foreign students at Tuskegee reveals another important contribution of America’s Black colleges and universities. At such institutions, the Atlantic world (and Asia) interacted with and influenced the South, America, and the larger world. Examining the experience of foreign students at Tuskegee adds more complexity to understanding race as a social construction, political leadership, movement of African dispersed people to the American South, and Black education at the turn of the twentieth century. This dissertation reconsiders Booker T. Washington and his institution as pioneers in global education. Washington’s emphasis on self-help, economic determination, political solidarity, and race pride provided the framework for more radical forms of pan-Africanism and Black Nationalism, which emerged shortly after his death in 1915.",1521787859,,Dissertations & Theses," McClure, BrianMcClureBrianMcClure, Brian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3296227041 , 87383092 , 66569 , 9781303825934 , 3586727 , 3586727", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303825934, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1521787859?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0520 Education history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0520 Education history"," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0520 Education history",," 0296 African American Studies , 0328 Black history , 0337 American history , 0520 Education history"," African American Studies , Black history , American history , Education history"," Social sciences , Education , Caribbean, Africa, and Asia students , Cultural space , Foreign students , Global education , Jim Crow South , Rural Alabama , Tuskegee Institute , Washington, Booker T.",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Educating+the+globe%3A+Foreign+students+and+cultural+exchange+at+Tuskegee+Institute%2C+1898-1935&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McClure%2C+Brian&amp;isbn=9781303825934&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Three Essays on Transportation and Energy Use,"My dissertation examines three questions related to transportation and energy use. In the first essay, I investigate the influence of workplace peers on an individual's travel decisions to work. Using a large dataset of U.S. military commuters and instruments to address the endogeneity of the decisions of one's workplace peers, I show that workplace peers positively influence one another's drive/no-drive decision and carpool/drive-alone decision. I also explore whether conventional measures of social status and seniority (i.e. income, education, age, and number of years in the military) predict who exerts the strongest influence on others, and find that intragroup influence appears to be stronger and more consistent than intergroup influence, which suggests that for commute decisions, social validation is a stronger motivator towards conformity than authority. In the second essay, I examine the short-run impacts of rapid increases in regional employment on travel time to work by exploiting exogenous variation resulting from movements of military troops during the 2005 Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) process. Employment levels often change more quickly than other factors that influence regional travel demand (e.g. number of two-worker households, vehicle ownership rates, travel preferences, etc.), making effective anti-congestion measures difficult to plan and implement. The BRAC process provides a convenient quasi-experimental framework to measure the short-run, congestion-related effects of employment growth on travel times because it occurred exogenous to the normal transportation planning process. I use difference-in-difference, difference-in-difference-in-difference, and instrumental variable methods to estimate these effects. The results are quite robust—each additional commuter added to the transportation network per square kilometer adds 0.0032-0.055 additional minutes of travel for all other individual commuters in the short run. According to back-of-the-envelope calculations, the short-run economic travel time cost of the 2005 BRAC is estimated to have cost communities near BRAC-affected bases between $155 million and $1.5 billion per year. This paper has relevance for both transportation planners who seek effective growth strategies and Department of Defense officials who seek to mitigate transportation impacts from troop movements and base closures. In the third and final essay, I examine how the carbon intensity (grams CO2e/MJ) of important upstream stages of bioenergy production will change over the next century for three generic energy pathways (biogas, bioliquids, bioelectricity) and five feedstocks (miscanthus, switchgrass, jatropha, eucalyptus, and willow). I construct an updated version of the Global Change Assessment Model ( GCAM ) which accounts for regional, temporal, and feedstock heterogeneity in five upstream stages: fertilizer production, fertilizer application, harvest energy, biomass transport energy, and pre-processing energy. Overall, I find that the median carbon intensity of these five upstream stages across scenarios declines by about 50% between 2020 and 2095 for bioelectricity, while bioliquids and biogas remain relatively flat. These trends result from several shifts in global agriculture production and land use. The shifting cultivation of biocrops between agricultural regions increases N 2 O emission intensity until the year 2050 and decreases it thereafter. Similarly, carbon intensities of bioenergy will decrease due to improved yields but this effect will be dampened before 2050 and accelerated after 2050 as effective yield of bioenergy moves towards less productive and more productive land, respectively. As yields increase, the supply radii of bioenergy agrosystems decreases by an average of 21% across scenarios between 2020 and 2095 assuming an average input of 2.0 million tons of biomass per yr-. My results suggest that shifts in land use play as important role in determining the trajectory of upstream greenhouse gas intensity of bioenergy in the future.",1525046118,,Dissertations & Theses," Morrison, Geoffrey MichaelMorrisonMichaelGeoffreyMorrison, Geoffrey Michael",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3305545511 , 80711952 , 66569 , 9781303792373 , 3614248 , 3614248", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303792373, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1525046118?accountid=14496," 0438 Environmental economics , 0709 Transportation planning , 0999 Urban planning"," 0438 Environmental economics , 0709 Transportation planning , 0999 Urban planning"," 0438 Environmental economics , 0709 Transportation planning , 0999 Urban planning",," 0438 Environmental economics , 0709 Transportation planning , 0999 Urban planning"," Environmental economics , Transportation planning , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Bioenergy , Census , Commute , Global change assessment model , Peer effects , Transportation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Three+Essays+on+Transportation+and+Energy+Use&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Morrison%2C+Geoffrey+Michael&amp;isbn=9781303792373&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Power of Immunization: The WHO and Global Immunization Programs from 1974 to the Present,"How do intergovernmental organizations exercise power and how has this exercise of power changed over the last decades? This dissertation addresses these questions through a case study of the WHO's involvement in global immunization programs. It seeks to bridge the gulf between global and local examinations of IGO power by simultaneously exploring the exercise of power at both levels. This dissertation includes four main empirical studies. The first asks whether global civil society or the society of states has greater influence on the spread of global norms and practices. It employs fixed-effects models to test the influence of IGOs (society of states) and INGOs (global civil society) on immunization coverage with polio, measles, DPT and BCG vaccines for the years 1980-2001. It shows that IGOs have a positive effect on immunization coverage, suggesting that the society of states has a greater influence on the spread of public health norms than global civil society. Further, INGOs have a negative effect on immunization with controversial vaccines, especially in high-income countries. I argue that global civil society's influence on the spread of global norms is particularly strong for controversial issues with ties to transnational social movements, like women's rights and human rights. For less controversial issues strongly associated with the state, like public health, the society of states plays a more important role. The second analyzes changes in global immunization policy, tracing power dynamics in deciding on policy changes. It assesses whether states or the WHO plays a more important role in determining policy changes through an analysis of WHA debates and by tracing the source of major policy changes. It argues that WHO experts play a particularly important role in determining how immunization policy has changed since the beginning of the Expanded Programme on Immunization in 1974. It further shows how the power to influence policy has shifted dramatically since the mid-1980s with the rise of new supranational coalitions, like the Task Force for Child Survival and the GAVI Alliance. These new coalitions have come to play a particularly important role in determining major policy changes, constraining the WHO's power to act independently on health issues. However, I argue that they represent a change how the WHO exercises power rather than a diminution in its power, per se. The third study looks at the idea of ""health as a human right"" as it applies to childhood immunization. In it, I analyze changes in the discourse of responsibility concerning childhood immunization. I show a clear shift from a limited vision, which placed ultimate responsibility for providing immunization on the state, to a vision of shared global/local responsibility which saw immunization as a ""right"" that both state and global actors had a duty to ensure. Through an analysis of donations to the Voluntary Fund for Health Promotion, I show how changing visions of global responsibility for immunization helped create a new system of shared global/local responsibility for funding immunization programs that relied heavily on long-term, voluntary funding for immunization programs in the developing world. My analysis shows that the EPI had great success increasing donations. However, doing so required constant efforts to maintain donor interest and prevent ""donor fatigue,"" efforts which led to the adoption of increasingly ambitious, and even unrealistic, program goals. Thus, despite increasing actual resources, the WHO's immunization programs came to face a situation of perpetual crisis, with programs facing near constant shortages and funding gaps. I argue that, ironically, the perception of crisis helped sustain needed program funding. The final study in my dissertation looks at two national immunization programs to examine factors favoring and impeding program success. I use residual analysis to identify states with particularly strong and particularly weak immunization programs, ultimately choosing Malawi (with a particularly strong program) and Cameroon (with a particularly weak program) for comparison. I argue that their divergent experiences arose in part from WHO advisers' lack of consideration of institutional legacies.

Ghana is no exception. Pentecostal churches' ecclesiastical, mediatic, and welfare networks have secured a strategic public role to these organizations in the country by filling part of the material and moral gaps left by the Ghanaian state in its post-structural adjustment moment. A new generation of influential charismatic leaders has emerged as the local faces of this global movement. Those are women, but mostly men who embody a Christian ethos that coordinates intense piety with self-achievement, inviting the youth to follow their ways. But this history is not only one of successful expansion, as observed in widespread public anxieties about the authenticity of ""men of god"" in the country. Concerned with the methods of authoritative reproduction of charismatic leadership, my research is based on 14 months of ethnographic fieldwork centered on the transmission of Pentecostalism in Ghana through both formal and informal methods of ""discipleship"", the process of ushering new converts into the Christian life. Chapter one situates the problem of Christian conversion in history, whereas chapter two builds an ethnographic model based on how converts move from ""spiritual rebirth"" to ""spiritual maturation"" and how their faith grows. Chapters three to five explore the discipleship structures of Lighthouse Chapel International, focusing especially on the Anagkazo Bible and Ministry Training Center, where the denomination's future full-time ministers are nurtured to recognize and attend to the call of God. Some of my guiding questions are: What is the role of human relations in Pentecostal piety? How is charisma transferred or transmitted?

The hip hop arts, including emceeing, deejaying, b-boying or b-girling (dancing), and graffiti, were first introduced to Morocco in the early 1990s through existing networks of migrants to and from Francophone Europe. Today hip hop music-making flourishes in the nation’s major cities and in smaller enclaves throughout the country. Under the late King Hassan II and his son, King Mohamed VI, the Moroccan state has adopted neoliberalizing policies and forms of governance since the early 1980s with far-reaching social and economic consequences. In this context, I ask how hip hop practitioners’ musical work enables and expresses new modes of citizenship and belonging while neoliberalization renders older forms of political participation less effective. To do this, I first situate Moroccan hip hop in relation to local musico-poetic traditions, already informed by previous generations’ encounters with processes of globalization, and translocally circulating hip hop aesthetics. Drawing from an archive of interactions, interviews, observations, documents, recordings, and live performances, I then show how practitioners use hip hop to intervene in national debates, and to respond to, critique, and take advantage of the effects of neoliberalization. While bringing the insights of network theory and Foucault’s notion of governmentality to an ethnography of neoliberalization, I describe practitioners’ techniques of self-management and self-care as they strive towards musical competence as well as greater economic and social mobility. In contrast with much scholarship on hip hop beyond the United States, I show that Moroccan hip hop music-making is critical, but not resistant. By locating their critiques in the terrain of the self rather than in movement-based politics, artists and their audiences effect political quietism through, not despite, their embrace of the transnational hip hop tradition’s normative ideology of critique and opposition as both a stylistic and an ethical goal. The practitioners’ construction of valued selves within their socio-musical networks prompt a reconsideration of agency, citizenship, and political action in a neoliberalizing postcolonial environment. Explicitly attracted by the discourses of freedom and resistance which hip hop and other Afrodiasporic sounds evoke in many parts of the world, members of Moroccan hip hop networks depend on those discourses to create music that enables local and translocal connections, even as their music-making and entrepreneurship conform to the goals of the neoliberalizing state. In a conjuncture profoundly shaped by Morocco’s adherence to neoliberal economic orthodoxy, Moroccan hip hop practitioners offer to the national imaginary an alternative expression of pious “modern” citizenship, to transnational markets a calculated balance of proficiency and difference, and to music scholarship an alternative to the frequently unquestioned association of hip hop production and oppositional politics.",1526501779,,Dissertations & Theses," Salois, Kendra ReneeSaloisReneeKendraSalois, Kendra Renee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3310637331 , 82220332 , 66569 , 9781303832376 , 3616392 , 3616392", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303832376, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1526501779?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0560 North African Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0560 North African Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0560 North African Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0413 Music , 0560 North African Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Music , North African Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Circulation , Citizenship , Hip hop , Morocco , Neoliberalism , Postcolonial",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Networked+Self%3A+Hip+Hop+Musicking+and+Muslim+Identities+in+Neoliberal+Morocco&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Salois%2C+Kendra+Renee&amp;isbn=9781303832376&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Universities as Global Actors in the Apparel Supply Chain: The Designated Suppliers Program,"Buyer-driven supply chains of modern capitalism put power into the hands of consumers. In the absence of a unified transnational labor movement, activists focus on mobilizing consumers to push corporations to adopt socially responsible practices. Universities have exclusive power over the multi-billion dollar collegiate apparel market and have used their influence to raise labor standards for ""sweatshop"" workers. Recognizing that monitoring organizations are incapable of examining thousands of factories involved in collegiate apparel production and that pricing practices of apparel brands prevent sustainable increases to labor conditions, student-activists have proposed the Designated Suppliers Program (DSP). Recently cleared by the Department of Justice, the DSP represents an opportunity for universities to ensure that factory workers have stable employment in a dignified workplace while earning a living wage. This would be a fundamental shift in production that could have far reaching impacts on the apparel industry and third-party monitoring. Currently, there is no academic literature on the program (or on the collegiate apparel industry in general), which needs to be placed in the broader context of social movements, labor rights, and global capitalism. The purpose of this thesis is to explore why the DSP has not been successfully implemented since it was first proposed in 2005. Before directly assessing this, the collegiate apparel industry is explored and the history of the DSP is presented. The necessity, desirability, and feasibility of the DSP are evaluated with specific emphasis on the perspective of universities. Ultimately, the study concludes that there are no flaws inherent in the design of the DSP that would prevent successful implementation and the primary reason it is not being pursued by universities is because of a lack of awareness of the program. Student campaigns for the DSP are poised to surge within the year, and along with success of the first factory that meets DSP criteria (Alta Gracia), universities will soon be faced with the task of critically and reflexively considering their position and influence in the global apparel industry.",1530472132,,Dissertations & Theses," Wegemer, ChristopherWegemerChristopherWegemer, Christopher",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3319900851 , 85970442 , 66569 , 9781303873478 , 1555275 , 1555275", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303873478, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1530472132?accountid=14496, 0510 Economics, 0510 Economics, 0510 Economics,, 0510 Economics, Economics," Social sciences , Apparel , Living wages , Supply chains , Sweatshops , University licensing , Worker rights",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Universities+as+Global+Actors+in+the+Apparel+Supply+Chain%3A%0AThe+Designated+Suppliers+Program&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wegemer%2C+Christopher&amp;isbn=9781303873478&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Horizons of Modernity: British Anthropology and the End of Empire,"This dissertation charts the ways in which the non-West came to be thought of as part of the modern world in the late British Empire, how that project became politically unfeasible during decolonization, and how colonial social anthropology was brought to bear on Britain itself in the 1950s. I show how in late colonial era social anthropologists began to combine participant-observer fieldwork, and totalistic analysis of a locality, with the understanding of the world's cultures in interaction with each other, rather than in terms of their comparative difference. This colonial anthropology of modernity emerged within a complex matrix of institutional geographies. The branch of that project instigated by Max Gluckman involved circulations not only between metropole and colony, but crucially within the specific regional situation found in South Africa. Through these circulations Gluckman was led to develop new tools for the understanding of the social as globally modern, which were further developed by his colleagues at Manchester, and which became highly influential on new understandings of a global modernity. These tools were imported from the colonial situation to bring a vibrant and productive anthropological dimension to the study of British society in the 1950s: a project which was instigated, funded, and shaped by the demands of social democracy and the construction of a welfare state. However the participant-observation of late colonial modernity, and in particular the processes of decolonization, became impossible under the demands of an emergent security apparatus. Social anthropology's methods were not intrinsically primitivist, but they were dependent on the circulation of anthropologists and their ability to live in fieldsites for extended periods of time, forging intimate links with their subjects. This made the anthropology of modernity both unacceptable and highly vulnerable in the era of impending decolonization, and allowed the discipline's subject matter to be conditioned by political coercion, in particular through restriction of movement. Thus we can see the complex ways in which political circumstances shaped, constrained and channeled the understanding of global modernities at the end of the British Empire.",1533546688,,Dissertations & Theses," Foreman, Grahame PhilipForemanPhilipGrahameForeman, Grahame Philip",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3326752751 , 82222442 , 66569 , 9781303961649 , 3623610 , 3623610", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781303961649, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1533546688?accountid=14496, 0335 European history, 0335 European history, 0335 European history,, 0335 European history, European history," Social sciences , Anthropology , British empire , British history , Cold war , Decolonization , History of anthropology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Horizons+of+Modernity%3A+British+Anthropology+and+the+End+of+Empire&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Foreman%2C+Grahame+Philip&amp;isbn=9781303961649&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Bringing the visual into focus: street art and contentious politics in brazil, bolivia and argentina","Politically committed street art has been mobilised time and again as a crucial strategy and means of expression. Yet, social movement scholars and political analysts have displayed a persistent tendency to overlook the specificities of visual tools and aesthetic experience in contentious politics. Consequently, political action is often described and understood in ways that are reductive and distorted. This dissertation brings together a range of insights from art and aesthetics, communications and cultural studies in order to address this quandary. Fundamentally, this study makes a novel contribution to the discipline of International Relations and to the associated field of Social Movement Theory by synthesising and extending scholarly work on political process and affective encounter in ways that facilitate a thoroughgoing analysis of politically committed street art and ‘what it can do’ in protest. Drawing on research undertaken in Bolivia, Brazil and Argentina, this dissertation argues that street art can and has been utilised strategically and instrumentally in protest, in mobilising resources and galvanising public opinion. It also contends that the framing processes leading to these outcomes have been under-specified due to their recourse to an epistemology that rationalises away the sensate dimensions of protest. A key claim of this thesis is that under certain circumstances street art can very usefully be modelled as a mode of infrapolitics; deliberately veiled expressions that seek to skirt the gaze of the authorities. However, it is also suggested that periods of seemingly rational and strategic deployments of street art are sometimes punctuated by something else, a collective sense of something gone awry, wherein the categories and tools for processing what went wrong are unavailable. In these instances, activists might be moved to produce street art or be moved by producing it. By attending to political street art’s instrumental and heuristic potentials, this piece of work goes beyond current discussions about framing and political opportunity. It also contributes a series of new case studies centred on periods of contention in Latin America.",1557571076,,Dissertations & Theses," Ryan, HollyRyanHollyRyan, Holly",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3415654501 , 90005312 , 101309 , U614798 , U614798 , http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/2729/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1557571076?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 0615 Political science, Political science," http://openaccess.city.ac.uk/2729/ , (UMI)AAIU614798 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bringing+the+visual+into+focus%3A+street+art+and+contentious+politics+in+brazil%2C+bolivia+and+argentina&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ryan%2C+Holly&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""A Beautiful Picture of Chaos"": La Vía Campesina and the Convergence of Food Sovereignty and Climate Justice","La Vía Campesina is an international network of peasant farmers that, since 1996, has promoted the concept of food sovereignty.

I contend that, while many of Vía Campesina’s proposals will require the establishment of intricate processes and systems depending on the geographic, political and cultural context in question, the network is demonstrating that its radical critiques, proposals and decision-making processes may help contribute to a larger counter-hegemonic narrative as a force to counteract global capitalism.",1631710733,,Dissertations & Theses," Dale, BryanDaleBryanDale, Bryan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3517500011 , 92230052 , 66569 , 9781321398540 , 1570744 , 1570744", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781321398540, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1631710733?accountid=14496," 0359 Food Science , 0404 Climate Change , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0359 Food Science , 0404 Climate Change , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0359 Food Science , 0404 Climate Change , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0359 Food Science , 0404 Climate Change , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Food Science , Climate Change , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Earth sciences , Climate change , Climate justice , Food sovereignty , Hegemony , La via campesina , Peasants , Social movements , System change",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22A+Beautiful+Picture+of+Chaos%22%3A+La+V%C3%ADa+Campesina+and%0Athe+Convergence+of+Food+Sovereignty+and+Climate+Justice&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dale%2C+Bryan&amp;isbn=9781321398540&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""Uniting What Capital Divides"": Union Organizing in the Workplace and the Community under the New Politics of Labor Informality in Argentina (2003-2011)","Recent Argentine history (2003-2011) suggests that the labor movement became increasingly relevant again, due to protests organized by unionized workers employed in firms of the formal economy. How can we explain the rise in organized labor militancy among formal sector workers given the persistence of the division between formal and informal workers? In this dissertation I sustain the hypothesis that there is an increasing interconnectedness between formal and informal workers that helps to explain labor revitalization in Argentina, in a context of high labor informality. The quantitative part of the study aims to show that the class structure of Argentina presents a more fluid boundary between formality and informality than the standard views usually assume. I provide evidence of strong structural connections between the formal and the informal proletariat, which include past work experiences and family ties across the formal-informal boundary. In the qualitative part of the dissertation, I study union strategies of workers in three formal sector factories located in the city of Pacheco (Northern Gran Buenos Aires). Evidence from this comparison suggests that labor revitalization was possible, in part, because new inclusive strategies of organized labor have made headway in overcoming the effects of the divisions. The systematic comparison between the three unions has allowed for the identification of the key variables that explain variation in the orientation and outcome of different union's strategies towards informal work. These variables include: the type of factory regime that regulates labor relations and company-community relations, the structural power of informal workers, the associational power and the organizational logic of the union. There is an ongoing debate among labor scholars and activists around the world about the possibilities of organized labor as a force of resistance to neoliberal globalization: Is the labor movement still capable of leading the struggles for social justice in a globalized world? Evidence from this study suggests that the possibility of a new labor upsurge that confronts capital's offensive in the global south depends (once again) on the alliances that labor movements establish to broaden their constituency, both within and beyond the workplace.",1641131057,,Dissertations & Theses," Elbert, Rodolfo GastonElbertGastonRodolfoElbert, Rodolfo Gaston",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3541060001 , 92840692 , 66569 , 9781321381825 , 3665576 , 3665576", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781321381825, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1641131057?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0510 Economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0629 Labor relations"," 0344 Social research , 0510 Economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0629 Labor relations"," 0344 Social research , 0510 Economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0629 Labor relations",," 0344 Social research , 0510 Economics , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0624 Occupational psychology , 0629 Labor relations"," Social research , Economics , Latin American Studies , Occupational psychology , Labor relations"," Social sciences , Psychology , Class analysis , Informality , Labor movement , Latin america",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Uniting+What+Capital+Divides%22%3A+Union+Organizing+in+the+Workplace+and+the+Community%0Aunder+the+New+Politics+of+Labor+Informality+in+Argentina+%282003-2011%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Elbert%2C+Rodolfo+Gaston&amp;isbn=9781321381825&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Unofficial histories: British amateur filmmaking from the 1930s to the 1950s,"This investigation of amateur filmmaking constructs a continuing history of the amateur cine movement from the 1930s, focusing primarily on the 1940s and the 1950s. These two decades followed an interruption in the development of recreational cinematography at the outbreak of World War Two in 1939. The research outlines the contribution made by amateurs during the war, when energies were diverted from filmmaking to promote public morale through film shows, to contributing technical expertise in the use of ‘substandard’ equipment for the military, and as recorders of the impact of war upon the people of Britain. The reconstruction and ideological progression of the movement in the immediate post-war period is charted as a time when a closer relationship with mainstream cinema was envisaged, when international links were formed with amateur filmmakers abroad, and the growth of television presented a paradoxical correlation both as an outlet for amateur exhibition and a rival to amateur home cinema. Amateur practice in the 1950s represented a commitment to modernism that led to technological and aesthetic innovation, with resultant expansion in filmmaking and social activity on the part of enthusiasts. This late flowering of the movement marked the onset of change from the cine world to the video/camcorder culture that was to follow in the late 1960s and 1970s, and, as such, it defines a significant historical moment in the wider chronology of the moving image. By introducing examples of amateur film from private collections, cine club libraries and regional archives, this thesis seeks to increase awareness of the diversity of amateur filmmaking, and to extend the currently limited chronology of the movement as an alternative contribution to official history, social history and the history of cinema.",1651903553,,Dissertations & Theses," Chalke, S.

Thus, the thesis explores the ways in which the formation of the capitalist historic bloc, the ascent and agency of Ukraine's capitalist and ruling class(es), and the agency of transnational capital are the driving forces behind that transformation and its socially destabilising nature. Social agency is one critical issue in this argument, in that as this thesis shows the main reason behind the inability to stabilise the social order in Ukraine is the ongoing rivalry in the process of class formation. Neoliberal marketization reforms (actively supported by IMF, WB, and EBRD) allowed Ukraine's rival ruling and emerging capitalist class and their fractions to pursue their personal economic interests and by that undermine possibilities for socio-economic stabilisation. Thus Ukraine's economy has been shaped through processes of accumulation by dispossession (Harvey, 2003), or privatisation, and capitalist class fractional formation and rivalry. In the latter process a capitalist class-for-itself has emerged through organising its fractions around political parties and through actively engaging with the EU and US lobby and interest groups. Through these practices, a process of trasformismo (Gramsci, 1971) and effective strengthening of Ukraine's capitalist historic bloc is evolving. Ukraine's ideologically semi-denationalised ruling (Sassen, 2007) and capitalist forces that emerge from the trasformismo dialectic by transnationalising Ukraine's state for their own political and/or economic gain essentially institutionalise the discipline of capital and facilitate a passive revolution (Gramsci, Ibid.) towards a generation of consent to the global hegemony of neoliberal market ideology.

La Vía Campesina (LVC), the organization that originated the idea, is food sovereignty’s global champion, with more than 200 million peasants, small farmers, and rural dwellers in its allied affiliates. This dissertation examines the FS issue in the Caribbean, where 100,000 LVC members live and work. Its focus is the island of Grenada, where a still-vibrant peasant farming tradition endures despite growing dependence on imported food. Grounded in fieldwork and historical investigation, the project examines Grenada’s small farming inheritance, the practices associated with it and their ongoing value. It also analyzes the constraints to the assertion of FS there, from the persistent hold of export-oriented plantation agriculture on the island’s economy to the pressures of neoliberal governance and international debt. The project’s centerpiece is a history of the Grenada Cane Farmers Association, an LVC organization. Beginning in the 1980s, its members refined the intercropping techniques and collective labor methods of their sugarcane farming forbears in a process of repeasantization of a kind that has become increasingly common across the world. The sophisticated farm system that GCFA members developed stimulated local food production in some of the poorest parts of the island and brought new pride and well-being to small farmers. The study details the setbacks the organization has suffered as prized cane lands were sold for tourist development, two hurricanes devastated the island, and recent governments pushed to commercialize small farm production, curtailing aid to small and subsistence farmers. Agriculture, the study concludes, remains the heart and soul of Grenadian culture. Commercialization of agriculture and the spread of consumerism threaten that culture, further entrenching poverty among the poor. As proponents of FS insist and this study illustrates, freedom for Grenadian communities in the twenty-first century—as for the newly-freed Afro-Caribbean peoples of the nineteenth—continues to reside in their right to access the world around them, to practice their material culture, and to feed themselves.",1710478210,,Dissertations & Theses," Kopka, MatthewKopkaMatthewKopka, Matthew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3801568681 , 87199112 , 66569 , 9781321961874 , 3716892 , 3716892", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781321961874, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1710478210?accountid=14496," 0285 Agronomy , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0329 Ecology , 0429 Entrepreneurship , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0285 Agronomy , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0329 Ecology , 0429 Entrepreneurship , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," 0285 Agronomy , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0329 Ecology , 0429 Entrepreneurship , 0432 Caribbean Studies",," 0285 Agronomy , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0329 Ecology , 0429 Entrepreneurship , 0432 Caribbean Studies"," Agronomy , Cultural anthropology , Ecology , Entrepreneurship , Caribbean Studies"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Food soverignty , Grenada , Small farmer culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Freedom+in+the+making+food+sovereignty+and+small+farmer+culture+in+Grenada+from+slavery+to+neoliberalism+and+beyond&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kopka%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781321961874&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Rule of Law Experts in Afghanistan: A Socio-Legal History of the First Afghan Constitution and the Indo-Ottoman Nexus in Kabul, 1860-1923","This dissertation provides the first transnational genealogy of the individuals, ideas, and institutions that culminated in the adoption of Afghanistan's first constitution in 1923. Based on archival research in Afghanistan, Turkey, India, and Britain, the study uncovers the longue durée history behind the text, including the genesis of its drafting commission, its multinational contributors from Constantinople to Qandahar, and the challenges they overcame in producing the pioneering charter. Drawing on records and manuscripts in Ottoman Turkish, Persian, Arabic, and Urdu, the study first traces the burgeoning tripartite ties between Ottomans, Afghans, and Indians from the aftermath of the 1857 Sepoy Rebellion to World War I. While historians of Pan-Islamism have tended to focus on radical ideologues and militant jihads, the emphasis on confrontation with the west has overlooked more subtle internal processes, such as the surge in students and scholars—as well as texts and ideas—traversing between the Ottoman and British empires at this time. Challenging conventional tropes of warring tribes and barren frontiers, I locate Afghanistan as a crucial juncture for such transnational social networks, and a center of debates about law, citizenship, and what it meant to be a modern Muslim. The dissertation culminates with the convergence of three simultaneous developments of profound historical impact in the greater Middle East: the collapse of the Ottoman empire, Afghanistan's independence from Britain in 1919, and the Indian Khilāfat Movement of 1919-1924. Amidst this dramatic backdrop of revolutionary politics and Pan-Islamic activism, I draw attention to an untold juridical history: the ensuing competition between Ottoman lawyers, Afghan administrators, and Indian jurists who converged in Kabul to market their expertise to the world's only fully-sovereign ""Islamic state."" It was the synthesis of these legal actors and the diverse juridical histories they represented, I conclude, that ultimately produced Afghanistan's first constitution between 1919 and 1923. In unearthing the social and cultural origins of Afghanistan's first constitution, the dissertation contributes a long overdue corrective to the scarce scholarly literature on Afghan legal history. The study also problematizes literature on the modern Middle East that silences the non-Ottoman ""periphery"" as passive objects caught between the colonial rivalry of Britain and Russia. Such works, I show, ignore the contributions of other independent rulers in the region such as the Bārakzai dynasty in Kabul, including the Afghan monarchs Amir `Abd al-Rahmān (1880-1901), Amir Habīb-Allāh (1901-1919), and Amir Amān-Allāh (1919-1929) in particular. By examining the Afghan court's patronage of scholarly networks from Damascus to Delhi, I argue that this unique constitutional project cannot be reduced to European mimicry and obeisance, nor an identity politics of Pan-Islam triggered at the behest of the Ottomans. In this manner, the dissertation enriches Afghanistan studies beyond the confines of the Great Game, Cold War, or recent literature on ""failed states."" Instead, the study persuades us to rediscover Afghanistan with a different past—when Kabul represented a center of debates, cosmopolitanism, and contested visions of reform in the region. The dissertation's focus on emergent transnational Islamic legal cultures—or juridical Pan-Islamism—between the late Ottoman empire, British India, and Afghanistan illustrates how modern notions of law, administration, and statecraft transcended politically-bounded territories. More specifically, the study sharpens our understanding of how urban centers within the vast socio-cultural zone stretching from the Balkans to Bengal came to be increasingly linked through specific networks, institutions, and processes of expertise associated with Islamic legal modernism. In tracing the social and institutional genealogy of the first Afghan constitution (1923), the dissertation examines how modern Muslim legal practices developing in Istanbul, Kabul, and greater Delhi in the long nineteenth century could simultaneously overlap, intersect, and co-evolve into distinct Ottoman, Afghan, and Indian juridical fields. Finally, as a socio-legal history it shows how a diverse cast of actors—Turks and Arabs, Indians and Persians, but most of all, Afghans—shaped the fields of constitutional law and politics in the greater Islamic world.",1719261987,,Dissertations & Theses," Ahmed, FaizAhmedFaizAhmed, Faiz",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3827899881 , 99423742 , 66569 , 9781339013046 , 3720334 , 3720334", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781339013046, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1719261987?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," Middle Eastern history , Islamic Studies"," Social sciences , Afghanistan , Constitutionalism , Islamic law , Legal history , Ottoman empire , Socio-legal history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rule+of+Law+Experts+in+Afghanistan%3A+A+Socio-Legal+History+of+the+First+Afghan+Constitution+and+the+Indo-Ottoman+Nexus+in+Kabul%2C+1860-1923&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ahmed%2C+Faiz&amp;isbn=9781339013046&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Peak Politics: Resource Scarcity and Libertarian Political Culture in the United States,"My dissertation uses the ""peak oil"" movement as a lens to analyze the convergence of apocalyptic environmental thinking and libertarian political culture in the recent United States. The ""peak oil"" movement was a twenty-first century American social movement of Americans who came to believe that oil depletion and other environmental problems would lead to the imminent collapse of global industrial society. Dedicated adherents developed a rich subculture, primarily online, and prepared themselves for the ""post-carbon"" future by conserving energy, changing occupations, and even purchasing land. Drawing on surveys of over 1,500 participants, ethnographic research, discourse analysis of peak oil websites and literary analysis of subcultural fiction, my research reveals a group of mostly white, male, liberal Americans struggling with the perceived threat of economic, environmental and geopolitical decline while the country undergoes a broad shift in political culture: the continued rise of libertarian ideals, accelerated by the influence of Internet technology. I view this apocalyptic subculture in the context of petroleum dependence, eco-apocalyptic discourses, the environmental discourse of ""limits to growth,"" white masculinity, climate change, and the influence of conservative individualism on American political culture.",1725144716,,Dissertations & Theses," Schneider-Mayerson, MatthewSchneider-MayersonMatthewSchneider-Mayerson, Matthew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3844040861 , 82917972 , 66569 , 9781339127446 , 3727574 , 3727574", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781339127446, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1725144716?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0791 Energy"," 0323 American studies , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0791 Energy"," 0323 American studies , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0791 Energy",," 0323 American studies , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0791 Energy"," American studies , Environmental Studies , Energy"," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Apocalypse , Energy , Environmentalism , Libertarianism , Masculinity , Sustainability",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Peak+Politics%3A+Resource+Scarcity+and+Libertarian+Political+Culture+in+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Schneider-Mayerson%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781339127446&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Indonesia's New Order, 1966-1998: Its Social and Intellectual Origins","This dissertation tackles one central problem: What were the intellectual and social origins of New Order Indonesia (1966-1998)? The analytic lens that this study employs to examine this society is the Indonesian middling classes' pursuit of modernity. The dissertation comes in two parts. Part One reconstructs the evolution of the Indonesian middling classes and their search for progress. Part Two uses three case studies to analyze the middling classes' search for Indonesian modernity under the New Order. The first explores the top-down modernization undertaken by President Soeharto's assistants at the National Development Planning Board, the Center for Strategic and International Studies, and the Agency for the Assessment and Application of Technology. The second case study investigates the ""bottom-up"" modernization performed by the Institute for Economic and Social Research, Education, and Information. The third case study deals with how several authors used popular fiction to criticize the kind of Indonesian modernity that emerged in the New Order era. This research yields several findings. First, the Indonesian middling classes championed a pragmatic, structural-functional path to modernity. Second, to modernize the country rapidly and safely, the modernizers proceeded in an eclectic and pragmatic manner. Third, between the Old and the New Order, there existed strong continuity in ideas, ideals, skills, and problems. Fourth, the middling classes' modernizing mission was fraught with contradictions, naiveties, ironies, and violence, which had roots in the nationalist movement in the first half of the twentieth century. The New Order was neither wholly new nor an aberration from the ""normal"" trajectory of Indonesia's contemporary history. The sort of modernity that the Indonesian middling classes ended up creating was Janus-faced.",1728056241,,Dissertations & Theses," Karsono, SonyKarsonoSonyKarsono, Sony",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3850674051 , 99879922 , 66569 , 9781339152769 , 3729422 , 3729422", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781339152769, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1728056241?accountid=14496," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies"," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies",," 0305 Asian literature , 0332 History , 0342 Asian Studies"," Asian literature , History , Asian Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Indonesia , Middle class , Modernity , New order , Non-governmental organizations , Think tanks",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Indonesia%27s+New+Order%2C+1966-1998%3A+Its+Social+and+Intellectual+Origins&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Karsono%2C+Sony&amp;isbn=9781339152769&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Democracy and the Politics of Social Citizenship in India,"Why do some pro-poor democracies in global South enact generous and universal social policies accompanied by empowering outcomes while others, similar in many ways, do not? If lower-class integration and programmatic commitment steers policy outcomes to be more egalitarian, what explains the variance in redistributive commitment within the cluster of radical democracies? These questions are examined in the context of two celebrated cases of pro-poor reform in the developing world: the Indian states of Kerala and West Bengal. Despite a host of similar background conditions (democratic framework, programmatic political parties, strong labor unions, and a high degree of subordinate-class integration), the cases display considerable variation in their redistributive commitment. Using the comparative-historical method, this dissertation seeks to explain the variance. It argues that the welfare divergences of Kerala and West Bengal are a function of their divergent modes of lower-class integration. In Kerala, a radical-mobilizational mode of lower-class integration has organized the poorer sections of the working classes—landless laborers and informal sector workers—in autonomous class organizations. This has enabled them to vigorously assert their interests within the working-class movement and harness state power to advance their interests through a wide range of legislative protections and statutory entitlements. In contrast, a clientelist-corporatist mode of lower-class integration in West Bengal relies on dependent mobilization of the poorer sections, without effective self-representing class organizations and without the strategic capacity to pursue class action independent of middle-class collaborators. These distinct modes of lower-class integration engender qualitatively different state-poor relationships and, in turn, divergent visions of social citizenship. The origins of these distinct modes are then traced to their historical and peculiar patterns of class formation, class struggle, and class compromise. This dissertation provides nuance to the welfare-state literature by proposing analytical differentiation within a subset of radical democracies and then by specifying the conditions under which lower-class power and state power can be harnessed to create more redistributive and empowering social outcomes in the global South. It also makes a contribution in linking agrarian labor movements to the nature of welfare regimes and more broadly to social citizenship.",1764222668,,Dissertations & Theses," Varughese, Anil MathewVarugheseMathewAnilVarughese, Anil Mathew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3947874911 , 85706192 , 66569 , 9781339353883 , 3742793 , 3742793", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781339353883, English, English,,2013,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1764222668?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0615 Political science , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Political science , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Democracy , India , Lower-class integration , Redistributive commitment , Social citizenship",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Democracy+and+the+Politics+of+Social+Citizenship+in+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Varughese%2C+Anil+Mathew&amp;isbn=9781339353883&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The politics of utopia and dystopia in late twentieth-century black literature,"This study demonstrates how the concept of utopia offers new insights into the convergence of art and politics in black literature. It is in part a response to Dohra Ahmad's 2009 call to address the nearly ""complete absence"" of scholarship on the black literary utopia. It takes an interdisciplinary and transnational approach to elucidating how black authors used utopian and dystopian literary forms to work for social transformation during the last third of the twentieth century, and historicizes their relationship to the social, racial, and political realities of the ""age of globalization."" Chapter 1 introduces this project and develops a comprehensive theoretical framework for reading black utopian literature. To do so, it places the ideas of black studies scholars like Paul Gilroy, Frantz Fanon, and others in conversation with utopian studies scholars like Ruth Levitas, Fredric Jameson, and Ernst Bloch. Chapter 2 explores the dialectic of dystopia and utopia in the fiction of American author John A. Williams. It concentrates on the radical politics of two works from the turbulent 1960s: The Man Who Cried I Am (1967) and Sons of Darkness, Sons of Light (1967). A postscript notes the political shifts in the more sober later novels Jacob 's Ladder (1987) and Clifford's Blues (1999). Chapter 3 offers utopian readings of Kenyan author Ngugi wa Thiong'o's novels Petals of Blood (1975), Devil on the Cross (1982), and Matigari (1987). It argues that the drastic aesthetic transformations observable in Ngugi's ""messianic"" fiction are related to his utopian politics. Chapter 4 discusses Alice Walker's Meridian (1976), Toni Cade Bambara's The Salt Eaters (1980), and Toni Morrison's Paradise (1997). It argues that these ""healing narratives"" represent a distinctive utopian sub-form, and that these novels attempt to revive the waning utopian desires of the 1960s while critiquing the problematic gender politics of that decade's Black Freedom Movement. Chapter 5 concludes by speculating about the shape of black utopian literature after the millennium through readings of Nigerian-British author Ben Okri's In Arcadia (2001), Jamaican-American author Claudia Rankine's Don't Let Me Be Lonely (2004), and American author Colson Whitehead's Apex Hides the Hurt (2006).

In the European context, this is exemplified by transformations to the traditional mobility patterns from East to West Europe (Koser and Lutz, 1998), with migrants more likely to be involved in temporary circular and transnational mobility (Favell, 2008). Since the end of the Second World War, historical and political events in Europe have facilitated the mobility of ethnic Germans from Eastern Europe to Germany. Subsequently, the fall of the Iron Curtain has permitted unrestrained East-West movements, which resulted in mass migrations towards the West and diaspora fragments in the East. However, after settlement in the West, ethnic Germans have also been absorbed within wider temporary and transnational movements (Koser, 2007). Within this context, this thesis examines the post-migratory lives of three generations of Transylvanian Saxons in Germany by exploring the cultural, social, economic and political dimensions of this community. This thesis aims to contribute to on-going academic debates about diasporas by explicitly responding to Hoerder s (2002) call for more studies on ethnic German diasporas. It shows that Transylvanian Saxons, who relocated to the ancestral homeland, do not disrupt identities and lives forged in diaspora, but rather, they negotiate complex identities and belongings in relation to both home and homeland . It reveals a double diaspora and the necessity to perceive identity and diaspora as dynamic processes and constantly evolving in relation to time, space and place. This double diasporic allegiance in the case of the Transylvanian Saxons suggests interrogating the formation of a return diaspora and its importance for processes of international migration.",1774250185,,Dissertations & Theses," Paul, LuciaPaulLuciaPaul, Lucia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989326581 , 102698502 , 101309 , 10025901 , 10025901 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/11541", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1774250185?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/11541 , (UMI)AAI10025901 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transylvanian+saxons%27+migration+from+romania+to+germany%3A+the+formation+of+a+%27return%27+diaspora%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paul%2C+Lucia&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""'the earth is on the move': modern mobilities and the travelling cinema of rené clair, fritz lang and alfred hitchcock","This project is concerned with the European careers and early Hollywood films of Rene Clair, Fritz Lang and Alfred Hitchcock and deals with the period from 1919 to the early 1940s, arguing that these three directors were engaged with an examination of modern life, which is best considered under a paradigm of ' mobilities'. Their presentation of modernity makes particular use of tourist imagery or 'film tourism', expressed through movement within the shot, editing and camera mobility. Their films draw attention to the flaws of an apparently 'mobile' capitalist world through a complex aesthetic, setting cinematic movement against cinematic stillness, in a dialectical manner, in order to challenge social immobilities. This offers the potential for critical reflection and questions how far the current formation of modem mobilities can be considered a 'natural' or ' ideal' form of social reality. Challenges to the dominant view appear in the directors' work, drawing on ' alternative' cinematic styles such as 'documentary' and 'mi cinema' to counter the industrialized nature of commercial cinema. This appear::&gt; particularly through a challenging of conventional forms within cinema, which are seen to often provide a limited vision of modern life. A key dialectic that occurs throughout these directors' work is one between the national and the transnational, which primarily appears through the consideration of national cinemas within Europe and the global dominance of Hollywood cinema. The central dialectic in each of these directors' films, however, is one between individualism and collectivism. This dialectic can be considered a result of each of these directors' engagement with the ways in which capitalism constructs flawed forms of 'subjectivity' and ' objectivity' within cinema, as well as within modernity as a whole. Each of these directors this provides a vision that draws attention to the problems within the mobilities of modern life.",1780279003,,Dissertations & Theses," Dooley, BenedictDooleyBenedictDooley, Benedict",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018871291 , 103028992 , 101309 , 10069583 , 10069583", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780279003?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10069583 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%27the+earth+is+on+the+move%27%3A+modern+mobilities+and+the+travelling+cinema+of+ren%C3%A9+clair%2C+fritz+lang+and+alfred+hitchcock&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dooley%2C+Benedict&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Resistance and re-appropriation: music and politics in postcolonial france,"As a privileged vehicle for expressing the protean diversity of resistance without endangering the consistency of its politics, culture (and activist culture even more so) stands as a core foundation of struggle, the hidden arena of contestation, and a fertile terrain for reconfiguration of activism in France. Yet the pivotal political role culture may play in the age of globalisation has tended to be overlooked by recent academic research on contemporary social movements in France. Numerous monographs, articulated around studies of specific social movements, cultural trends or genres, have undertaken to partially analyse this ’culturalist’ evolution of politics: studies detailing the ethos of specific instances of the altermondialiste movements taken in their cultural context; studies of cultural movements (such as the Creole cultural movement); or of sub-cultures such as French hip hop placed in their social context. And yet the study of the broader dynamic remains an overwhelmingly underexplored area of scholarly research. This thesis undertakes an analysis of the inter-penetration between some contemporary musical forms and political resistance to neoliberalism, inscribed in a more global logic of cultural resistance to domination and oppression. One of its main purposes is to address the reasons why and the extent to which political resistance in contemporary France has taken an almost irremediable cultural turn. It presents a study of the dynamic of re-appropriation of symbolic power at stake in the emergence of a counterculture of resistance. The underlying concern of this project lies in identifying the extent to which musical practice is a particularly relevant form of political appropriation, or of re-appropriation of social identities, especially in areas of exclusion wherein the latter are very often denied or stigmatized, or at least generally essentialised by a variety of dominant narratives and discourses. Thus, it explores musical practices of resistance to neoliberal domination in socially marginalised areas of France, often associated with postcolonial communities. The aim is to better understand the kind of impact musical resistance has in the shaping of social identities in postcolonial France through their relation to political activism.",1783894575,,Dissertations & Theses," De Caunes, AudeDe CaunesAudeDe Caunes, Aude",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4013227451 , 103112492 , 101309 , 10057021 , 10057021 , https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/resistance-and-reappropriation(25453548-c1e6-4dc2-9305-f47ee4c8dcfa).html", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1783894575?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/resistance-and-reappropriation(25453548-c1e6-4dc2-9305-f47ee4c8dcfa).html , (UMI)AAI10057021 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Resistance+and+re-appropriation%3A+music+and+politics+in+postcolonial+france&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=De+Caunes%2C+Aude&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Importing 'faith': the effect of american 'word of faith' culture on contemporary english evangelical revivalism,"This thesis is an investigation of three exemplary ‘faith ministries’ that are, or have been recently, active in the South-East of England. These ministries have embraced principle from the American Health Wealth and Prosperity Movement (HWPM). The author seeks to demonstrate that key concepts and approaches in the self- presentation or rhetoric of these church leaders have their foundations in popular American culture that has developed since the early 19th century, and that distinctive characteristics of these ministries are particular examples of the globalisation of American culture and, particularly, its distinctive pragmatism. The three ministries considered are Michael Reid, Colin Urquhart and Jerry Savelle (an American with an international ministry and offices in the UK). An interpretative methodology employing two cultural frameworks to deconstruct the movement’s rhetoric is applied to the writings, webcasts and other teaching materials marketed by these ministries. The first of these frameworks is a historical, interpretative theory acknowledging the distinctive influence of Pragmatism, Scottish Common Sense Realism, the Protestant Work Ethic and neo-Gnosticism that are an explanation of the roots and the continuing development of this way of thinking in American culture (and the globalisation of its religion). The second framework is a more religious interpretation that explains the nature of the movement’s ethos, worldview and interpretive assumptions. It acknowledges the influence of Positive Thinking, Subjective Idealism, Transcendentalism and New Thought. An analysis of the performative rhetoric and teachings of the three persons considered (and their mentors) examines the use of mechanistic language and concepts such as principles, steps and keys to describe how their teachings can work for people’s benefit. The thesis asks: What social and theological construction of reality, and what factors or reasons, make these ministries appealing to people, and what is the true nature of what these ministries offer? After a literature review and initial methodology, the rhetorical analysis proceeds by considering the nature of the ministries using insights from narrative theory, psychology, congregational studies, Maussian analysis, organisational theory, and theories of enchantment, charisma, class and cognitive dissonance. This thesis observes that while pragmatic religious solutions attract adherents disenchanted by advanced secularization in modern Britain, this often results in bewilderment when the promises of the rhetors fail. The thesis is original in its finding that many of the miracles claimed by such charismatic ministries are the result of suggestion similar to the miracles of the mind cure movement of the nineteenth century and any seemingly miraculous financial provision to leaders is the result of members of their discourse community giving in the hope that they may receive in return, these miracles are therefore often socially constructed.",1785481724,,Dissertations & Theses," Ackerley, GlynAckerleyGlynAckerley, Glyn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018872101 , 103112492 , 101309 , 10058869 , 10058869 , https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/importing-faith(6027989b-8a08-48cf-9d99-aa0718254729).html", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013,, English, English,,2013,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1785481724?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/importing-faith(6027989b-8a08-48cf-9d99-aa0718254729).html , (UMI)AAI10058869 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Importing+%27faith%27%3A+the+effect+of+american+%27word+of+faith%27+culture+on+contemporary+english+evangelical+revivalism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ackerley%2C+Glyn&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"A Grassroots Approach to Peace and Security in West Africa,"West Africa faces grave challenges to peace and security. Many peace and security actors in the region operate at the policy level in urban centers, leaving the majority of the population, which is illiterate or rural, behind. Tostan, an American Non-Governmental Organization, implements human rights-based education in rural villages across West Africa and engages social networks in movements to transform harmful social norms. This thesis provides direction for Tostan to further apply its grassroots approach to the promotion of peace and security in West Africa. The Swedish International Development Agency (Sida), a governmental agency, funded Tostan’s Peace and Security Initiative, whose overall goal is to create links between rural communities and institutional peace and security bodies in West Africa and build peace and security within and between grassroots social networks. Preliminary research during the initiative revealed unprecedented information regarding West African community stakeholder’s perspectives on the types and sources of conflict in their lives. Discrimination or marginalization due to differences in ethnicity, race, religion, political affiliation, or caste and a lack of communication were cited as sources of conflict in all five West African countries in which research was conducted, and the exclusion of women’s voices was noted in all but one. Programmatic suggestions in this work are based on a review of academic literature and the results of the preliminary research regarding the root causes of conflict and successful means of building peace and security. An evaluation of other regional peace and security actors, including the African Union, WANEP, Gorée Institute, regional working groups on women, peace, and security, and traditional mediators, informs recommendations for effective partnerships. New programming focuses on the right to freedom from discrimination, resource management, inclusion of women in peace building, traditional and alternative conflict resolution skills, regional peace and security initiatives, and intra and inter-network dialogue.",1858966019,,Dissertations & Theses," Block, LisaBlockLisaBlock, Lisa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4302777411 , 110140652 , 189128 , 9781369493887 , 10305824 , 10305824", Dissertation/Thesis, 2013, 9781369493887, English, English,,2013,PQDT - Global,2013,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1858966019?accountid=14496, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations, 0601 International Relations,, 0601 International Relations, International Relations," Social sciences , Africa , Grassroots , Peace , Security",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Grassroots+Approach+to+Peace+and+Security+in+West+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2013-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Block%2C+Lisa&amp;isbn=9781369493887&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Citizens of the market: New forms of international migration and their consequences for people, parties and political systems","How does high-mobility migration affect politics in the migrants' countries of origin? This dissertation examines the socio-political effects of intra-EU migrations using quantitative and qualitative data from Romania and Poland, two of the European Union's main migrant-sending countries. The project makes a triple contribution. First, it analyzes on multiple levels the impact of free movement, producing a complete picture of systemic political transformation. It examines shifts in migrants' worldviews, political attitudes and attachments (micro-level ethnography); changes in the electoral appeal of political parties in regions with relatively higher citizen mobility (meso-level quantitative analysis of Polish voivodships and Romanian judete); and the strategies migrant-sending countries use to cope with the challenges of free movement. Second, unlike sociological, economic and ethnographic studies of recent migratory flows, which treat the phenomenon's political dimension as a side effect, this project anchors the research agenda in mainstream political science by placing the state-citizen relationship at the core of the inquiry as a conceptual benchmark for understanding migration-related political evolutions. Third, by focusing on EU-associated free movement, it sheds light on a special case of international mobility that departs from previous population movements associated with globalization. As the dimensions of citizenship (civil, political and social) become unbundled, economic rights and access to the European supranational market are the elements governments use to compensate citizens for the erosion of welfare state citizenship. I introduce the concept of citizenship of the market to reflect this development. By analyzing the recalibration of the state-citizen relationship in high-mobility contexts, the project provides answers to questions that scholarship of immigration, political transnationalism, and diaspora management fail to address. The findings show that EU-triggered change does not occur only top-down, via government reform and political elites, but also bottom-up, under the influence of societal actors and new political power groups.",1502867483,,Dissertations & Theses," Paul, RuxandraPaulRuxandraPaul, Ruxandra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3231773901 , 85786322 , 66569 , 9781303724541 , 3611570 , 3611570", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303724541, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1502867483?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Citizens , High-mobility migration , International migration , Political parties",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Citizens+of+the+market%3A+New+forms+of+international+migration+and+their+consequences+for+people%2C+parties+and+political+systems&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Paul%2C+Ruxandra&amp;isbn=9781303724541&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Jews and the Russo-Japanese War: The Triangular Relationship between Jewish POWs, Japan, and Jacob H. Schiff","The beginning of the twentieth century marked a crucial period both in Japanese and Jewish history. While Japan sought to develop itself as a leading Asian nation, Jews experienced the enlightenment, mass immigration to America, and antisemitism that dominated Jewish concerns. The Russo-Japanese War of 1904-05, the first war of the twentieth century, brought the fate of the two geographically distant people together. Both the Japanese and the Jews were, in different ways, transformed by this war. The subsequent story of the ""Japanese and the Jews"" has its roots in this critical and much-neglected historical episode. My dissertation, based on research in multiple archives and Japanese-language sources that have never before been utilized by Jewish historians, focuses upon five different topics, concerning Jews and the Russo-Japanese War: (1) the American Jewish response to the war, (2) the social movement of Jewish POWs, (3) Jacob H. Schiff's influential ties to Japan, (4) Japan and Schiff's mission to help Russian Jewish refugees during the Russian Civil War and (5) the early formation of the image of ""the Jew"" in Japan. As this dissertation demonstrates, the Russo-Japanese war of 1904-05 actually had a significant transnational impact on Jews - from the Russian Jews who became prisoners of war in Japan to the American Jewish leaders who utilized the war to further their own agendas, to the Japanese, whose image of Jews was transformed. After the war ended in 1905, it continued to have repercussions on Jews long afterwards, especially during World War I. The Russo-Japanese War may not have been one of the most major events of the twentieth century for Jews, but important figures such as Jacob H. Schiff and Joseph Trumpeldor, a Zionist hero, were involved. Its impact was felt in World War I, the Russian Revolution, and the Russian Civil War. This dissertation shows that the war brought Jews and Japanese in close contact for the first time in history and deepens our understanding of Jews in Asia.",1504276255,,Dissertations & Theses," Muraoka, MinaMuraokaMinaMuraoka, Mina",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3236971431 , 85915652 , 66569 , 9781303725418 , 3611646 , 3611646", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303725418, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1504276255?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0578 History , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0578 History , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0578 History , 0751 Judaic studies",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0578 History , 0751 Judaic studies"," Asian Studies , History , Judaic studies"," Social sciences , Jacob h. schiff , Japan , Jew , Pow , Refugee , Russo-japanese war",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Jews+and+the+Russo-Japanese+War%3A+The+Triangular+Relationship+between+Jewish+POWs%2C+Japan%2C+and+Jacob+H.+Schiff&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Muraoka%2C+Mina&amp;isbn=9781303725418&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""Let My People Go!"" The Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry and the Rise of American Jewish Identity Politics","An in-depth study of the formative years of the American wing of the international Soviet Jewry Movement, ""Let My People Go! The Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry and the Rise of American Jewish Identity Politics"" aims to reconstruct the history of the first grassroots organization to take to the streets on behalf of the three million Jews trapped behind the Iron Curtain in the turbulent decade of the 1960s. Divided into five chapters that trace the chronological development of the relatively unknown Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry from its founding in the spring of 1964 through the passage of the 1974 Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which denied the Soviet Union ""most-favored-nation"" status in its trade dealings with the United States pending the right of free emigration, this dissertation restores SSSJ to its central role in the formation of the American wing of the Soviet Jewry Movement. Based on primary source material held in half a dozen archives across the country as well as on oral history collections and personal interviews conducted with leading members of SSSJ, the following chapters peel back layers of historical interpretation to find in this unique grassroots organization the embodiment of the social and political movements of the 1960s in America. By placing the efforts of Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry alongside those of the Civil Rights, anti-war, and Black Power Movements, the ensuing chapters make the case for a broader, more inclusive definition of the New Left as what historian Van Gosse termed a ""movement of movements"" committed to implementing a radical vision of democracy based on the dignity of the individual and the right to full citizenship for all. In so doing, ""Let My People Go! The Student Struggle for Soviet Jewry and the Rise of American Jewish Identity Politics"" reaffirms the significance of the Soviet Jewry Movement not just as a pivotal event in (American) Jewish history but also as one that has a central place in the broader narrative of American history.",1504276341,,Dissertations & Theses," Orenstein, AmaryahOrensteinAmaryahOrenstein, Amaryah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3236971311 , 85915572 , 66569 , 9781303725470 , 3611652 , 3611652", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303725470, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1504276341?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0578 History , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0337 American history , 0578 History , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0337 American history , 0578 History , 0751 Judaic studies",," 0337 American history , 0578 History , 0751 Judaic studies"," American history , History , Judaic studies"," Social sciences , American jews , Identity politics , Social movements , Soviet jewry movement , Sssj , Student struggle for soviet jewry",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Let+My+People+Go%21%22+The+Student+Struggle+for+Soviet+Jewry+and+the+Rise+of+American+Jewish+Identity+Politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Orenstein%2C+Amaryah&amp;isbn=9781303725470&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Encountering competing empires: Journeying Chinese communities in Southeast Asia under Chinese, Dutch, and British imperial rule","This dissertation examines the relationship between China’s expansionism and overseas Chinese empowerment in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. It looks at the connection between the Chinese state's ambition of extending its political sphere beyond its territorial boundaries and overseas Chinese increasing political, social, and economic rights. By focusing on the Chinese in the Dutch East this multi-sited research shows that the two seemingly different projects, namely the construction of a pan-Chinese nation and state beyond its territorial boundaries and the overseas Chinese empowerment in colonial Southeast Asia are mutually enforcing processes that developed in tandem. By approaching this topic from the perspectives of imperial competition and journeying overseas Chinese, I argue that China’s construction of a pan-Chinese nation and state, and its competition with European empires and the emerging Japan for overseas Chinese support generated a new identification space for the Chinese in the Dutch East Indies. The competition between empires for overseas Chinese support created opportunities for the overseas Chinese to transform their status from stateless subjects to Chinese nationals, Japanese imperial subjects, and Dutch colonial subjects. My dissertation reveals that Dutch Indies Chinese, a politically unimportant overseas Chinese community that was not recognized by any empire as official subjects before the late nineteenth century, subsequently became pivotal for the promulgation of new state policies. They organized transnational movements in the cities along the Chinese and Southeast Asian coasts and enhanced their statuses by maneuvering China’s policies and negotiating for political and socioeconomic privileges in the Dutch colony.",1506548236,,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, Oi YanLiuYanOiLiu, Oi Yan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3244031161 , 86078302 , 66569 , 9781303749247 , 3579114 , 3579114", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303749247, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1506548236?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0332 History , 0638 South Asian Studies"," History , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , British Empire , Chinese expansionism , Colonialism , Dutch East Indies , Imperialism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Encountering+competing+empires%3A+Journeying+Chinese+communities+in+Southeast+Asia+under+Chinese%2C+Dutch%2C+and+British+imperial+rule&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Oi+Yan&amp;isbn=9781303749247&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Reorienting American Liberal Judaism for the twentieth century: Stephen S. Wise and the early years of the Jewish institute of religion,"This study explores how Rabbi Stephen S. Wise and supporters from the Free Synagogue and elsewhere sought to reorient American liberal Judaism by establishing the Jewish Institute of Religion (JIR) in the early 1920s. They believed the leaders of the Reform movement at that time were reluctant to relinquish an outmoded approach that had lost relevance in light of a new demographic reality whereby over a million Eastern European Jews now living in New York were becoming the dominant presence in American Jewish life. The JIR founders attributed this to Reform's having become insular, unresponsive to pressing social issues, overly concerned with respectability, and spiritually lifeless. Wise and his circle advanced a vision for liberal Judaism they considered to be more modern and American, more liberal and more deeply Jewish. While they attempted to advance their vision for liberal Judaism on many fronts, they believed that critical to the task was creating a New York-based scholarly center capable of training a new kind of rabbi. This work describes the key individuals in addition to Wise who created the Institute, the international scholars who formed the first faculty, and the debates that ensued and obstacles encountered as the institution took shape. From the outset, the founders determined that JIR would differ from existing schools in significant ways. For example, prioritizing the ""oneness of Israel,"" JIR would include faculty and students representing a broad spectrum of belief, from Orthodox to non-Orthodox, and Zionist to non-Zionist. All students would enter with a bachelor's degree, and in addition to studying traditional fields like Bible, history and Talmud, they would study modern Hebrew, social service and contemporary trends in Jewish education. In addition, through fieldwork, students would utilize the metropolitan area as a laboratory for learning how to serve American Jewry as inspiring, socially-engaged rabbis. With these and other innovations, Wise and the founders believed JIR would point twentieth-century liberal Judaism in new directions. Though they did not succeed in all they set out to achieve, many aspects of the reorientation of American Jewish religious life they pursued remain with us today.",1507461700,,Dissertations & Theses," Idelson, ShirleyIdelsonShirleyIdelson, Shirley",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3246516511 , 86132582 , 66569 , 9781303738623 , 3612322 , 3612322", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303738623, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1507461700?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history , 0751 Judaic studies",," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history , 0751 Judaic studies"," Religion , American history , Judaic studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Hebrew union college , Jewish institute of religion , Liberal judaism , Reform judaism , Seminary education , Stephen s. wise",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reorienting+American+Liberal+Judaism+for+the+twentieth+century%3A+Stephen+S.+Wise+and+the+early+years+of+the+Jewish+institute+of+religion&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Idelson%2C+Shirley&amp;isbn=9781303738623&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Learning norms or changing them? State actors, state violence, and human rights education in India","How do perpetrators of state violence understand their actions, and how do their perceptions inform their responses to human rights education and activism? I examine this question through twelve months of fieldwork with 33 police, military and paramilitary officers who were participating in human rights education in North India. The research is based in social constructivist scholarship on international norm diffusion. Officers express beliefs about human nature and justice that conflict with the human rights ethos and support violations such as torture. Rather than prioritize the protection from harm as the human rights movement does, officers believe that what matters is harm to whom and for what reason. At the same time, officers admit that they use torture more widely than their own conceptions of justice would allow. But because they believe that torture is sometimes right, they see this as an imperfect implementation of their principles rather than as a violation of them. This does not mean, however, that they reject human rights education. Instead, they interpret human rights in ways that support their actions, using the language and logic of rights to defend violations. This reveals how state actors can accept norms without changing their beliefs or behavior. Finally, these findings do not suggest a tension between ""local"" beliefs and ""international"" norms. The course in which officers are enrolled emphasizes the connection between human rights principles and many Indian religious, cultural, and national traditions. Officers acknowledge these connections. But they prioritize competing conceptions of justice, which are also ""local,"" and their perception of what is required in their work as law enforcers. This indicates the importance not of ""local"" beliefs in general, but of the specific roles people play within a society and their perceptions of what these roles require. Furthermore, officers draw from competing international norms to justify their actions. They reference norms of state security and the actions of countries such as the United States to defend torture and other violations, further complicating any presumed dichotomy between ""local"" and ""international"" norms. I close with the implications of the findings for human rights education and activism.",1512229919,,Dissertations & Theses," Wahl, RachelWahlRachelWahl, Rachel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3264252861 , 86577102 , 66569 , 9781303764523 , 3613494 , 3613494", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303764523, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1512229919?accountid=14496," 0615 Political science , 0998 Education philosophy"," 0615 Political science , 0998 Education philosophy"," 0615 Political science , 0998 Education philosophy",," 0615 Political science , 0998 Education philosophy"," Political science , Education philosophy"," Social sciences , Education , Education , Human rights , India , Police , Torture , Violence",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Learning+norms+or+changing+them%3F+State+actors%2C+state+violence%2C+and+human+rights+education+in+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wahl%2C+Rachel&amp;isbn=9781303764523&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Role of Prayer in the Transformation of Social Systems from the Perspective of Select Leaders,"This dissertation brings greater understanding on the role of Christian prayer from the perspective of select leaders in the godly transformation of social systems.

My ""actors"" are ""hybrid"" progressive-issue social movement organizations (SMOs) that consciously attempt to bridge both cognitive and material divides among diverse coalition members from union, community, faith-based and service-based organizations. This study focuses on how ideas reduce uncertainty, act as coalition-building resources, empower agents to contest existing institutions, act as resources of new institutions and finally coordinate agents' expectations, thereby reproducing institutional stability. I examine how these SMOs are reshaping ideas, interests and institutions on the urban scale in efforts to reclaim and recast the responsibility and role of local institutions in mitigating the effects of global capital. The re-emergence of interest in organizations in urban sociology is being driven in no small part by the rise in sophistication of non-profit actors (e.g., think tanks, community-based organizations, advocacy organizations) and of the strategies and tactics used to influence political and policy issues, as well as the proliferation of institutional ""access points"" as Allard correctly points out on the state and local levels. The hybrid progressive organizations that I examine are products of the structuration process that has been ongoing for decades, whereby conservative-oriented policy and advocacy organizations have been dominant on the state level, consistently producing a policy climate not only conducive to investment and business outcomes, but also aggressively pursuing an anti-union, slashing social-services strategy as part of a particular vision of what it means to create a ""business friendly"" regulatory environment in a state. Therefore, I have also identified three other factors that appear in tandem with progressive, hybrid organizations based on the state or regional level: 1) networked leadership development, 2) resource coordination and 3) deliberate state/regional-level strategies around coalition building, legislative advocacy and leadership development.",1521775969,,Dissertations & Theses," Clayton, Kathleen YangClaytonYangKathleenClayton, Kathleen Yang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3296169141 , 87380372 , 66569 , 9781303817168 , 3615641 , 3615641", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303817168, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1521775969?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0626 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning"," 0344 Social research , 0626 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning"," 0344 Social research , 0626 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning",," 0344 Social research , 0626 Sociology , 0999 Urban planning"," Social research , Sociology , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Community , Conservative politics , Labor , Leadership training , Progressive politics , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Controlling+interests%3A+Institutions+and+ideas+in+labor-community+coalitions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clayton%2C+Kathleen+Yang&amp;isbn=9781303817168&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Using novel technologies to confront challenges in predator conservation, community ecology, and citizen science","Habitat fragmentation and loss is the primary driver of mammalian carnivore extinctions across the world. In the Santa Cruz Mountains of California, native carnivores navigate daily through a landscape highly impacted by human development and activities. The puma ( Puma concolor ) is the apex predator of this habitat, but it is susceptible to both direct and indirect influences of expanding human populations. Smaller predators are not only affected by anthropogenic disturbances, but also by intraguild competition with the more dominant pumas. My dissertation utilizes new technologies to study the ecology and behavior of carnivores in a human dominated environment. In my first chapter, I catalogued puma behaviors in the wild using measurements recorded by accelerometers attached to the animals. I found that I could clearly distinguish movement from non-movement behavior, and that predation events had distinctive accelerometer signatures. The second chapter describes how I used movement data recorded by GPS (Global Positioning System) collars to evaluate puma behavioral responses to increasing development. Pumas primarily traveled nocturnally, and moved more often and further in areas of higher housing development. The increase in activity in human dominated landscapes could have major repercussions on the energetic expenditure of pumas living in fragmented areas. My third chapter addresses the impacts of human development and activities on the entire carnivore community. Combining passive and experimental observations using motion-detecting camera traps, I studied the spatiotemporal behavior of predators across a gradient of human influences. Mesopredator activity was restricted temporally in areas of high human use, and certain predators (e.g., pumas and foxes) were more sensitive to increasing development. Lastly, education and outreach is an important component of carnivore conservation. In my fourth chapter, I describe results from a Facebook game I developed with collaborators. Players earned points by identifying wildlife species from camera trap photographs. I found that agreement among players was the most important determinant of accuracy, and that untrained Internet users could identify many wildlife species. The Internet is an emerging tool for outreach, and I hope my work encourages other ecologists to think creatively about incorporating citizen scientists into their research through social media.",1526488168,,Dissertations & Theses," Wang, YiweiWangYiweiWang, Yiwei",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3310607931 , 87744032 , 66569 , 9781303842559 , 3617122 , 3617122", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303842559, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1526488168?accountid=14496," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0477 Environmental Studies",," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0329 Ecology , 0477 Environmental Studies"," Wildlife Conservation , Ecology , Environmental Studies"," Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Accelerometer , Behavioral ecology , Big cats , Citizen science , Occupancy , Puma concolor",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Using+novel+technologies+to+confront+challenges+in+predator+conservation%2C+community+ecology%2C+and+citizen+science&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wang%2C+Yiwei&amp;isbn=9781303842559&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""A Right to Be Safely Born"": The Quest for Health Justice for American Mothers and Children, 1890-1965","Between 1890 and 1965, the ideology of government responsibility for maternal and child health represented a continuous and central goal that fueled programs and institutional networks of progressive and liberal social policy advocates. Beginning in the settlement houses of the 1890s, a cadre of female bureaucrats, social reformers, and their political allies developed an array of federally based programs. Conservative stakeholders--among them anti-feminists, representatives of the medical industry, anti-communists, and white supremacists--strenuously opposed this vision of health justice, arguing that health was a personal responsibility in which government should play no part. Despite the achievements of government-based progressive reformers in instituting their vision in urban settlement houses, under the Sheppard-Towner Act of the mid-1920s and during the years of the New Deal and World War II, the Cold War's approach to domestic social policy after 1947 clamped down on their vision. After this conservative turn against social democratic solutions to welfare needs, these progressive advocates shifted their attention to the international health rights movement and to community-based maternal and child health activities. My dissertation introduces the concept of health justice as an interpretive lens to trace the history of health policy progressives and their institutional networks. On the one hand, health justice reflects the communitarian premise that the health of all members of society is essential for the common good. On the other hand, health justice implies that health and health care are individual rights that government ought to protect. While communitarian arguments were often on the tip of the tongues of social reformers, a passionate belief in citizenship-based rights and redistributive and humanitarian ideas of social justice undergirded their policy ideas and became a more explicitly stated position during the New Deal and World War II. This justice-based approach to maternal and child health policy was consistently undermined by the prevailing counter-ideologies of individual responsibility for health, local control of public services, racial segregation in health services, and the commodification of health care. My work relies on primary evidence collected from the personal papers of key protagonists, the administrative records of the Children's Bureau housed at the National Archives, oral histories, and the presidential papers of Harry S. Truman. Published primary materials have been culled from memoirs, professional public health and medical journals, as well as the popular press.

Hundreds of Cuban volunteers—more than from any other Latin American country—traveled to Spain to fight for the Republic in both the International Brigades and the regular Republican forces, to provide medical care, and to serve in other support roles; children, women, and men back home worked together to raise substantial monetary and material aid for Spanish children during the war; and longstanding groups on the island including black associations, Freemasons, anarchists, and the Communist Party leveraged organizational and publishing resources to raise awareness, garner support, fund, and otherwise assist the cause. The dissertation studies Cuban antifascist individuals, campaigns, organizations, and networks operating transnationally to help the Spanish Republic, contextualizing these efforts in Cuba's internal struggles of the 1930s. It argues that both transnational solidarity and domestic concerns defined Cuban antifascism. First, Cubans confronting crises of democracy at home and in Spain believed fascism threatened them directly. Citing examples in Ethiopia, China, Europe, and Latin America, Cuban antifascists—like many others—feared a worldwide menace posed by fascism's spread. Second, despite their recent anticolonial struggle against Spain, Cubans cared deeply about its fate for reasons of personal, familial, and cultural affinity. They interpreted the Republic as a ""new"" Spain representative of liberation and the Nationalists as seeking return to the ""old"" Spain of colonial oppression. Third, pro-Republican Cubans defined antifascism in Cuban terms. People of many different backgrounds and views united around a definition of antifascism closely related to their shared domestic political goals: freedom from strongman governance, independence from neocolonial control, and attainment of economic and social justice. Radical, moderate, and even largely nonpolitical individuals and groups in Cuba found in antifascism and support for the Spanish Republic a rallying cry with broad appeal that allowed them to strengthen solidarity at home and abroad. Cubans defined antifascism in both negative and positive terms, as a movement against fascism but also toward unity, democracy, sovereignty, and justice.",1527009137,,Dissertations & Theses," Lambe, Ariel MaeLambeMaeArielLambe, Ariel Mae",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3311634471 , 87526922 , 66569 , 9781303842856 , 3617146 , 3617146", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303842856, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1527009137?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Latin American history , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Antifascism , Cuba , Spanish civil war",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cuban+Antifascism+and+the+Spanish+Civil+War%3A+Transnational+Activism%2C+Networks%2C+and+Solidarity+in+the+1930s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lambe%2C+Ariel+Mae&amp;isbn=9781303842856&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Grounded Labels from the Behavioral International Economic Development Growth Path Model on Economic Development Patterns from 2002-2012,"Economic models generally fail to adequately measure positive and negative growth paths in development through agrarian, industry, and service economies. The purpose of this grounded theory study was to design a new model that could accommodate both directions of growth and better measure development paths with particular attention to labors contributions. The theoretical foundation for this study was Walt Whitman Rostow's 5 economic stages of growth classifications. This Study attempted to find the most common economic growth path. While most development models use three to five classifications, this study used nine new classifications giving it a unique and specific look at international development. The two model indicators used were gross domestic product composition by sector (the economic success of the system) and labor force occupation by sector (labors activity to help define behavior of the system). The sample included data from 279 nations from the CIA World Factbook. A systematic method of analysis was used in the open, axial, and selective theoretical coding phases. The key findings reveal 9 distinct growth phases, 15 identified growth paths, and 4 distinct path clusters which helps measure and define development behavior.

The implications for social change show that policy makers can benefit from using this new model, named the behavioral international economic development growth path model, to provide improved decision making measurements related to agrarian, service, and industry sectors of the economy.

Puerto Rico is a remarkable setting to study transnationalism because of its particular historical and sociopolitical relationship with the US, which grants Puerto Ricans citizenship and thus ease of movement, while retaining a strong attachment to the Island. It can be argued that Puerto Ricans define transnationalism, being simultaneously insiders and outsiders to the US national scene. The youths involved in these dynamics learn to navigate different educational and social settings on the Island and the US. Factors like language and the educational contexts are highly influential in the students' lives and their educational outcomes. The study was conducted over a period of seven months in two public schools in Puerto Rico. The data were collected through interviews, classroom observations, and home visits with return migrant students, their parents, and their teachers and school staff. The combination of these data collection methods and the variety of participants, provided a nuanced portrayal of the nature of their transnationalism and the social and educational experiences of the families in and out of the school context.",1535091644,,Dissertations & Theses," Soto-Santiago, Sandra L.Soto-SantiagoL.SandraSoto-Santiago, Sandra L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3332090441 , 88348222 , 66569 , 9781303889370 , 3619595 , 3619595", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303889370, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1535091644?accountid=14496," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy , 0636 Sociolinguistics",," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy , 0636 Sociolinguistics"," Multicultural Education , Education Policy , Sociolinguistics"," Social sciences , Education , Emotional attachment , Migration , Public education , Puerto Rican transnational youths , Schooling experiences , Transnationalism and education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Getting+used+to+home%3A+The+social+and+educational+experiences+of+Puerto+Rican+transnational+youth&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Soto-Santiago%2C+Sandra+L.&amp;isbn=9781303889370&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Todavía bailamos la cueca sola: From local protest practice against Chile's dictatorship to (trans)national memory icon,"This dissertation is a multi-sited cultural-historical ethnography about the cueca sola , a dance that was created to denounce the disappearances of citizens during Chile's dictatorship in the 1970s. Some women with missing relatives, who belonged to the music group Conjunto Folclórico of the Association of the Relatives of the Detained and Disappeared (AFDD), created a variation on the Chilean national dance (the cueca - traditionally a courtship dance between a man and a woman) which did not involve a male partner. Instead, they performed it alone. In so doing, these women, who were among the first to denounce the military's human rights abuses in public, were able to give symbolic presence to their absent loved ones. Performances of the cueca sola did not stop with the official end of the military regime in 1990. Remarkably, this local expression of protest developed a cultural afterlife outside of its initial context of mobilization and emerged as a widely recognized symbol of women's resistance to an oppressive regime. It is now a travelling memory practice that has been presented for commemorative purposes, both in and outside of Chile and both during and after the dictatorship, by members of the original group and by others. Additionally, references to the cueca sola have found their way into various cultural products (films, music, literature, theater). My study follows some of the unexpected paths that this dance practice has travelled over its 35-year trajectory. Based on interviews (with filmmakers, performance artists, professional dancers, members of a Chilean folkloric dance group from the U.S., and the women from the original group), ethnographic fieldwork in Chile and California, and an analysis of textual and audiovisual sources, this is the first work to examine the post-authoritarian and transnational dimension of the dance's history. Drawing from research on social movements, memory studies, and dance/performance theories, the dissertation is a comprehensive case study of a unique expression of women's political discontent that has been ""danced to resist"" a human rights-violating repressive regime, and that is still ""danced to remember"" its victims and the long-term societal effects of state-violence.",1537049149,,Dissertations & Theses," Babic, Karolina S.BabicS.KarolinaBabic, Karolina S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3337663751 , 88474992 , 66569 , 9781303893209 , 3619799 , 3619799", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303893209, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1537049149?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0336 Latin American history , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Latin American history , Womens studies , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Chile , Dance , Dictatorship , Disappeared , Memory , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Todav%C3%ADa+bailamos+la+cueca+sola%3A++From+local+protest+practice+against+Chile%27s+dictatorship+to+%28trans%29national+memory+icon&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Babic%2C+Karolina+S.&amp;isbn=9781303893209&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The sovereignty of global Englishes: Translingual practices and postnational imaginaries,"Ideologies of monolingualism sustain three interrelated and seemingly fundamental assumptions about language: (1) native speaker usage is authentic and thus ideal, (2) a person’s birthplace correlates with proficiency, and (3) the plurality of languages and varieties results in incomprehensibility. Although the persistence of monolingualism is a central concern for this dissertation, rather than merely dismissing or resisting the logics of monolingualism, this dissertation explores how the practices of English in global contexts, characterized by the movement of people and language resources and the constitution of postnational imaginaries, provides new ways of thinking about the historical and contemporary persistence of monolingual normativity. Therefore, although discourses of nationalism have historically sustained the exceptionalist logics of monolingualism, emerging postnational forms of social organization and language practice invite us to see authenticity as a reconstitutable discourse, national belonging as a mobile practice, and incomprehensibility as a subversive resource. Thus, this dissertation argues that the resilience of monolingualism inhibits us from seeing English language proficiency as a discursive formation: rather than a measure of communicative competence, proficiency must be reimagined as reflective of one’s ability to autonomously transgress normative boundaries and communicative conventions. Drawing on a hybrid methodology that incorporates historiography; metacritique of existing scholarship; analyses of various artifacts, including linguistic landscapes, poetry, and popular culture; and theorization of classroom practice; this dissertation insists that, as an increasing number of people around the world use English, as it becomes a global resource increasingly dissociated with any single national imaginary, we are positioned to reconsider what it means to be a proficient user of English. In short, to be proficient at English is to be a “sovereign” user of English: not only able to use English correctly, but able to use English incorrectly without being pathologized for doing so.",1537070739,,Dissertations & Theses," Lee, Jerry WonLeeWonJerryLee, Jerry Won",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3337787621 , 88478872 , 66569 , 9781303895425 , 3619908 , 3619908", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303895425, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1537070739?accountid=14496," 0279 Language arts , 0291 Modern language , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0679 Language"," 0279 Language arts , 0291 Modern language , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0679 Language"," 0279 Language arts , 0291 Modern language , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0679 Language",," 0279 Language arts , 0291 Modern language , 0441 English as a Second Language , 0679 Language"," Language arts , Modern language , English as a Second Language , Language"," Language, literature and linguistics , Education , Global English , Language proficiency , Monolingualism , Postnational imaginaries , Translingual",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+sovereignty+of+global+Englishes%3A+Translingual+practices+and+postnational+imaginaries&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lee%2C+Jerry+Won&amp;isbn=9781303895425&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Reconstructing identity/revising resistance: A history of Nuevomexicano/a students at New Mexico Highlands University, 1910–1973","This dissertation addresses the development of Nuevomexicano/a student identity at New Mexico Highlands University (NMHU) during three periods: (1) New Mexico’s Territorial period and early statehood, (2) the 1940s, and (3) the late 1960s and early 1970s. Nuevomexicano/a student identity was shaped through a process of accommodating to and resisting institutional powers. Since 1898, Nuevomexicano/a students have been active members of the university community, despite periods when they constituted a small portion of the student body and the institution’s frequent disregard for Nuevomexicano/a culture and language. As they participated in campus activities, Nuevomexicano/as reconstructed their individual and collective identities, appropriating terms such as Spanish or Chicano/a, as a rhetorical strategy to revise their relationships with the university. Extralocal institutions, including government institutions, national protest movements, and international organizations shaped public conversations about cultural identity. During the first two periods, students employed subtle strategies of resistance that included presenting speeches and reorganizing student government. Often labeled as accommodationist, these strategies represent viable rhetorical strategies that provided students access to dominant literacies, which were used to promote social change. In the 1970s, Chicano/a students utilized more aggressive practices, such as a weeklong sit-in, to radically alter the institutional culture at NMHU. In the forty years since the sit-in, NMHU has developed into a university that supports its Nuevomexicano/a students and incorporates elements of their culture into the university’s social fabric.",1540785312,,Dissertations & Theses," Gallegos, Juan MartinGallegosMartinJuanGallegos, Juan Martin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3349897781 , 88660592 , 66569 , 9781303892455 , 3619756 , 3619756", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303892455, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1540785312?accountid=14496," 0520 Education history , 0681 Rhetoric , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0520 Education history , 0681 Rhetoric , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," 0520 Education history , 0681 Rhetoric , 0737 Hispanic American studies",," 0520 Education history , 0681 Rhetoric , 0737 Hispanic American studies"," Education history , Rhetoric , Hispanic American studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Education , Chicana/o students , Chicano/a identity , Hispanic-serving institutions , Histories of rhetoric , New Mexico Highlands University , Nuevomexicano/a",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reconstructing+identity%2Frevising+resistance%3A++A+history+of+Nuevomexicano%2Fa+students+at+New+Mexico+Highlands+University%2C+1910%E2%80%931973&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gallegos%2C+Juan+Martin&amp;isbn=9781303892455&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Interrupting 'green capital': Transformative political practice at the frontiers of wind energy in Mexico,"This thesis examines how contestations over the large-scale production of wind energy are transforming political life in the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, Mexico. In the 1980s, the Mexican state and international actors targeted the Isthmus as a place for investing in green energy development. Today, wind farms occupy between 10,000 and 15,000 hectares, but could extend to between 40,000 and 50,000 hectares if the 'full' wind energy potential of the Isthmus is developed. Indigenous social movements are interrupting this 'greening' of the Isthmus, however, sustaining that the expansion of green energy, despite its associations with the greater ecological good, is detrimental to their survival. How is the harnessing of wind in the Isthmus becoming a new frontier of green capitalism? And how are indigenous movements reshaping the practices of green energy in Mexico? I examine these questions through the case study of indigenous-led resistance to the construction of a large-scale wind energy project in the southern Isthmus: the San Dionisio project along the Barra de Santa Teresa. As the Mexican government pursues green energy, the Isthmus is re-signified as an environmentally responsible space of liberal peace. Drawing on participant observation, interviews with NGOs and local residents, and analysis of environmental and energy policy documents, I argue that this is a ""virtual peace"", one that makes invisible the character, agency, and needs of civil society actors. By framing resistance to wind farming as the cause of conflicts to be managed for the greater common good, state-sanctioned 'pacification' of the Isthmus entrenches short-term direct violence and structural violence as constitutive of green capitalism.",1547145742,,Dissertations & Theses," Sellwood, Scott A.SellwoodA.ScottSellwood, Scott A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3379232281 , 89195652 , 66569 , 9781303942341 , 1557187 , 1557187", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303942341, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1547145742?accountid=14496, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography, 0366 Geography,, 0366 Geography, Geography," Social sciences , Green energy , Peace studies , Political ecology , Resource geographies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Interrupting+%27green+capital%27%3A+Transformative+political+practice+at+the+frontiers+of+wind+energy+in+Mexico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sellwood%2C+Scott+A.&amp;isbn=9781303942341&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Credit Default Swaps Regulation and the Use of Collateralized Mortgage Obligations in U.S. Financial Institutions,"The fast and easy global movement of capital throughout the financial system, from lenders to borrowers and through intermediaries and financial market participants, has been recognized as a source of instability associated with illiquidity and financial crises. The purpose of this research was to better understand how regulation either enables or constrains capital movement. The theoretical framework comprised 2 contrasting public policymaking models, Arrow's rational-comprehensive model and Kingdon's garbage can model, which were used to derive opposing hypotheses. The research question addressed the nature of the relationship between Credit Default Swaps (CDSs) regulations and the flow of capital into Collateralized Mortgage Obligations (CMOs) when lenders share their borrower-related loan risks through intermediaries with other market participants. This quantitative study was a quasiexperimental time series design incorporating an autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model using secondary data published by the U.S. government. The 2 independent variables were regulatory periods involving 2 CDSs regulations and the dependent variable was capital in the U.S. financial system that is deployed to CMOs. The Commodity Futures Modernization Act of 2000's ARIMA model (1,2,1) was significant at p &lt; .05 and was negatively correlated to the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008's ARIMA model (1,1,0), r = -.91, n = 18, p &lt; .001.

Structural transformations associated with global capitalism have led to divergent experiences for male and female youth coming of age in the 21 st century. Girls are experiencing greater social integration and social mobility whereas, boys are facing social exclusion and limited opportunities. As young men precariously forge new transitions to adulthood, young women are constructed as ideal flexible subjects, benefiting from feminist achievements, and advancing in the new service economy. Yet in reality, girls continue to face gendered base violence, sexism, and burdens of responsibilities. Through this lens, I examine how gender operates as an organizing principle in young people's lives today in the Lower East Side (LES) of New York City. This study also documents how people create cultural alternatives that reflect their values and progressive politics and analyzes how this has been down in the past. It offers an organizational case study of The Lower Eastside Girls Club in an effort to increase our understanding of the history and significance of a successful struggle to educate, employ, and carve out a safe space for women and girls in neoliberal New York. It documents how the Girls Club builds upon a legacy of grassroots initiatives in the LES, including the settlement house movement of the Progressive Era and Mobilization for Youth of the 1960's. This study asks: what should an education accomplish in a democracy? (Giroux 2013) It examines the limitations of the Girls Club's engaged practice of uplift and empowerment in relation to its progressive politics and critical pedagogy. I suggest that education is a terrain in the ""right to the city"" (Lefebvre 1968), and that the Girls Club, in constructing alternative models of education and community engagement, is locally engaging in a broader struggle for social justice, albeit with limited success. This study concludes with an analysis of Girls Club's efforts to push forth a community-led development model that puts women and youth at the center, melding the politics of Jane Addams and Jane Jacobs and offering an alternative urban vision.",1552723254,,Dissertations & Theses," Sugg, JenniferSuggJenniferSugg, Jennifer",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3400025471 , 87771672 , 66569 , 9781303957543 , 3623360 , 3623360", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303957543, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1552723254?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0515 Education , 0733 Gender studies"," 0344 Social research , 0515 Education , 0733 Gender studies"," 0344 Social research , 0515 Education , 0733 Gender studies",," 0344 Social research , 0515 Education , 0733 Gender studies"," Social research , Education , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Education , New york , Urban , Women , Youth",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Coming+of+age+in+neoliberal+New+York&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sugg%2C+Jennifer&amp;isbn=9781303957543&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"&lt;i&gt;Buen Provecho&lt;/i&gt;: The strategies of participation and construction in Peruvian food policy,"Food security and food sovereignty are being integrated into policy frameworks around the world, predominantly in the countries of Latin America. In 2013, Peru was on the cusp of approving a national policy and national law relating to food security and food sovereignty. Engaging food regime analysis as introduced by Harriet Friedmann and Philip McMichael to historicize the political economy of the global food system, I document how food sovereignty challenges the neoliberal policy paradigm in Peru and simultaneously risks cooptation into the neoliberal food regime, arguing that the final result of food sovereignty being excluded from any officially approved law in Peru represents the preservation of food sovereignty's radical nature and resistance to cooptation. Using the theory of ""neoliberal multiculturalism"" by Charles Hale, I show that the strategies of participation and construction used in the Peruvian food policy-making process open new alternatives beyond the assumed binary of cooptation or resistance in the institutionalization of a social movement platform. This thesis, developed in the midst of the policy debate in Peru, is a timely and relevant study that has implications for food policy processes around the world. With the emergence of more initiatives in Latin America and beyond to institutionalize the food sovereignty framework into national policy, careful analysis of the risks, challenges, and opportunities of doing so will inform future efforts.",1554689002,,Dissertations & Theses," Toledo, AlexandraToledoAlexandraToledo, Alexandra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3408453601 , 89849492 , 66569 , 9781303956584 , 1557711 , 1557711", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303956584, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1554689002?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0630 Public policy , 0640 Sustainability"," Latin American Studies , Public policy , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Civil society , Food policy , Food security , Food sovereignty , Institutionalization , Peru",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Buen+Provecho%3A+The+strategies+of+participation+and+construction+in+Peruvian+food+policy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Toledo%2C+Alexandra&amp;isbn=9781303956584&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Now It's Our Time To Eat! Stakeholder Perceptions of Influences on the Development of Leaders in Malawi,"This study explored stakeholder perceptions of influences on the development of sustainable leaders in Malawi, in Sub-Saharan Africa. Narratives from three stakeholder groups—leaders of grassroots organizations including civil society groups, academics and emerging scholars, and professionals who represent the small but growing middle class—capture insights on leader development in the post-colonial period starting with the country's transition from single-party to multi-party rule in the early to mid-1990s. This multi-party movement galvanized disparate interests into political action for a democratic form of government, and set the backdrop for the current environment for leader development. Since then, the landscape for leadership in Malawi has been dynamic and fluid. Perceptions of leader attributes are contested as traditional customs, culture, and values increasingly collide with Western philosophies and an increasing Chinese influence. Informant narratives examined the role of internal and external influences on the leadership landscape, including educational institutions, social and community organizations, civil society and religious groups, transnational non-governmental organizations, and geopolitical groups, along with donor nations. In addition, the cult of personality and Big Man syndrome were addressed along with the relevance of ethno-linguistic systems and geographic factions in aligning the roles and responsibilities of emerging leaders with the goals and aspirations of their constituents. Finally, the effect of leadership principles and philosophies on economic conditions and development were evaluated in terms of empowering marginalized citizens and preparing their leaders to act globally while thinking locally. Findings contribute to the emerging body of scholarship on leadership in Sub-Saharan Africa by providing narratives from stakeholders who will play a key role in preparing the next generation of future leaders.",1554689605,,Dissertations & Theses," Reynolds, Kanton T.ReynoldsT.KantonReynolds, Kanton T.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3408453111 , 89849372 , 66569 , 9781303963544 , 3623755 , 3623755", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303963544, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1554689605?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0331 African history"," 0293 African Studies , 0331 African history"," 0293 African Studies , 0331 African history",," 0293 African Studies , 0331 African history"," African Studies , African history"," Social sciences , Anglophone sub-saharan africa , British colonialism , Critical theory , International relations , Leadership , Malawi",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Now+It%27s+Our+Time+To+Eat%21+Stakeholder+Perceptions+of+Influences+on+the+Development+of+Leaders+in+Malawi&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reynolds%2C+Kanton+T.&amp;isbn=9781303963544&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The origins of Hip Hop culture,"The purpose of this research project is to analyze the origin of the cultural paradigm known as Hip Hop culture and its founding institution, the Universal Zulu Nation. Hip Hop culture is the result of various social and cultural elements, combined with the vision of a Bronx youth who combined various cultural elements to develop a new cultural paradigm for the purpose of activism and higher consciousness. In forming this cultural historiography of Hip Hop, this project will analyze the period of 1946 to 1975, with greater emphasis on the years 1968 to 1975. The hypotheses presented in this work is that Hip Hop culture is the convergence of the 1960s urban youth gang culture, Black Consciousness Movements in New York City, and the unique artistic elements that include forms of music, visual art and dance. This research project will offer a cultural history that utilizes an interdisciplinary approach, which includes historiographical and anthropological research methodologies. The historiographical methodologies will include: sub-altern historiography, regional historiography, oral history, and archival research methods. The anthropological methodologies will include: ethnography, participant observation, quantitative data, social anthropology, and cultural psychology. This project will present testimony from primary sources regarding the events, ideas and context of the social and cultural factors that contribute to the genesis of Hip Hop culture. In this work, great emphasis will be placed on oral history and first hand accounts as primary sources, by which the historiography of Hip Hop culture may be formed. This project is not intended to be a history of Hip Hop music or rap music, but rather an analysis of the cultural factors that helped form what is now the global phenomenon of Hip Hop culture and its founding institution; the Universal Zulu Nation.",1556121533,,Dissertations & Theses," Young, Omar AkbarYoungAkbarOmarYoung, Omar Akbar",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3413514721 , 89550762 , 66569 , 9781321012163 , 1560048 , 1560048", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321012163, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1556121533?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0413 Music"," 0296 African American Studies , 0413 Music"," 0296 African American Studies , 0413 Music",," 0296 African American Studies , 0413 Music"," African American Studies , Music"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Black consciousness , Hip Hop , Universal Zulu Nation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+origins+of+Hip+Hop+culture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Young%2C+Omar+Akbar&amp;isbn=9781321012163&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Seeds of discontent: Antecedents to the Haitian Revolution 1750–1791,"This paper is a sociological exploration of interactive processes between 1750 and 1791 that fostered an emergent collective intentionality and contributed to the Haitian Revolution, the only successful uprising of enslaved African and African descended people. The project employs concepts pertaining to the African Diaspora to understand members of that global process as creators of their own reality. Collective intentionality brings focus to how enslaved Africans and their descendants invoked shared historical and cultural memory as they aimed toward liberation. Other theoretical ideas from the social movements arena of sociology provide a basis for understanding antecedent activities as critical to the analysis of revolutions and other contentious politics. Africans' intentionality in late 18th century Haiti (Saint Domingue) was oppositional to enslavement; and it was grounded in a shared African cosmic orientation, reinforced by common status, and further diffused by ongoing interactions in protected social spaces. With specific attention to northern Saint Domingue, I collected and analyzed data using secondary source documentary review and content analysis of primary source data from the Marronnage in Saint Domingue online database. The research found that African and African descendants' deliberate removal of self - self-liberation - from enslavement and their participation in culturally distinct sacred rituals were important forms of resistance prior to the Haitian Revolution.",1556553358,,Dissertations & Theses," Eddins, Crystal NicoleEddinsNicoleCrystalEddins, Crystal Nicole",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3414724621 , 87773742 , 66569 , 9781303997181 , 1559003 , 1559003", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781303997181, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1556553358?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0626 Sociology"," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0626 Sociology",," 0296 African American Studies , 0432 Caribbean Studies , 0626 Sociology"," African American Studies , Caribbean Studies , Sociology"," Social sciences , African diaspora , Haiti , Haitian Revolution , Historical sociology , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Seeds+of+discontent%3A+Antecedents+to+the++Haitian+Revolution+1750%E2%80%931791&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Eddins%2C+Crystal+Nicole&amp;isbn=9781303997181&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Celebrity Power: Spotlighting and Persuasion in the Media,"As technological and business demands have transformed the operation and demands on news and entertainment media, celebrity activists have proliferated. Only a few years ago, the notion that these celebrities were anything other than opportunistic was laughable. Less likely was the prospect that celebrities might have real power to change minds or affect outcomes. It is difficult enough for politicians to set public agendas. Can celebrities compete? This dissertation compares celebrities to politicians and focuses upon one key area of potential power: media agenda setting. If celebrities hope to change the public agenda to focus on the issues they think are important, can they gain attention for those issues and are they persuasive? The results of a time series analysis and an experimental study conclude that they are capable of not only competing with politicians in ""spotlighting"" and persuasion on political issues, but may at times, exceed their abilities. These findings potentially upend what many political scientists assume about power, particularly scholars who study policymaking, policy entrepreneurship, and social movements. According to the data presented in this dissertation, celebrities produce larger spikes of media attention when advocating on a public issue than politicians do, a relationship that bears out across media types. More celebrities generates more media attention, while politician/celebrity joint interventions seem to have mixed results, implying that politicians benefit more from the public attention celebrities generate than celebrities benefit from public association with politicians. Moreover, celebrities are capable of persuasion on political issues of public importance, despite whatever personal feelings people have for them. The more perceivably important the issue, the more likely the celebrity is to be persuasive. However, celebrities are more likely to persuade on issues that are less polemic. Celebrities do not have the legitimacy or credibility/expertise of politicians, but many make up for these weaknesses by allying with credible transnational advocacy groups. The more institutionalized they are, the more likely they are to be able to persuade target audiences. Finally, the more they are perceived to be ""authentic"" based on their skills and talents, the more effective they are at persuasion.",1556639273,,Dissertations & Theses," Harvey, MarkHarveyMarkHarvey, Mark",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3414801581 , 89700942 , 66569 , 9781321011388 , 3626266 , 3626266", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321011388, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1556639273?accountid=14496," 0451 Social psychology , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," 0451 Social psychology , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," 0451 Social psychology , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications",," 0451 Social psychology , 0615 Political science , 0708 Mass communications"," Social psychology , Political science , Mass communications"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Psychology , Agenda setting , Celebrities , Media , Persuasion , Policy entrepreneur , Public opinion",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Celebrity+Power%3A+Spotlighting+and+Persuasion+in+the+Media&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Harvey%2C+Mark&amp;isbn=9781321011388&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"African Nazarites: A Comparative Religious Ethnography of Rastafari and &lt;i&gt;Ibandla lamaNazaretha&lt;/i&gt;,"Two rapidly growing theological and cultural movements currently sparking global interest are Rastafari and Ibandla lamaNazaretha. Founded by the Zulu preacher Isaiah Shembe during the 1910s, Ibandla lamaNazaretha originated as a hierarchical church order that worships at outdoor temples in the province of KwaZulu-Natal and currently comprises a number of splinter groups centralized around the Southern African peninsula. Rastafari, however, born in Jamaica, commenced as a multi-headed ideology that blossomed in scattered pockets across the Caribbean island and stemmed from the interpretations of a prophecy generally attributed to Marcus Garvey about a king to be crowned in Africa (circa 1920) as applied to the 1930 coronation of Ras Tafari Makonnen as Haile Selassie I, 225th Emperor of Ethiopia. Today, Ibandla lamaNazaretha and Rastafari comprise adherents and sympathizers numbering in the tens of millions and their presences connote varying degrees of political, theological, social, and cultural influence, especially in Africa and the Caribbean today. This dissertation argues that both Ibandla lamaNazaretha and Rastafari perpetuate a conflation between the ""Nazirite"" from the Old Testament (Numbers 6:1-8) and the ""Nazorean"" of Matthew 2:23 through the hailing of a contemporaneous saviour: i.e. Haile Selassie I for Rastafari and Isaiah Shembe for Ibandla lamaNazaretha. Within this theological framework, both Rastafari and Ibandla lamaNazaretha have provided renewed life to the long defunct Ancient Judaic purification rites of the Nazirite, but have also adapted them in the context of messianism for the benefits of Africanness and the postcolonial concerns of indigeneity. Thus, through the persistence of indigeneity, the influence of Indian ideals of peaceful resistance, and the appropriation of various biblical themes, both Black African movements have successfully empowered the dispossessed by creating liminal communities wherein expressions of agrarian self-reliance flourish outside the auspices of a subjugating elite; a hermeneutic of naziritism unifies the discernable African, Judaic, Christian, Indian, and European hybridic roots.",1561542243,,Dissertations & Theses," Chakravarty, K.

Like many world's fairs before it, Expo 67 was designed to mediate relations between peoples and things through its architecture. The origins of this work lay in the efforts of Daniel van Ginkel and Blanche Lemco van Ginkel, architects and town planners who, in remarkable reports, drawings, and architectural ideals advanced between 1962 and 1963, outlined the basis of a fundamentally new, though never fully realised, world's fair in the late twentieth century. Party to the Congrès Internationaux d'Architecture Moderne and its influential prewar edicts on functionalist town planning as well as to groups like Team 10 and their opposition to diagrammatic generalisations by an emphasis on the personal, the particular, and the precise, the van Ginkels also drew on contemporary theories and practices of North American urban renewal when first conceiving Expo 67 as an instrument for redeveloping downtown Montreal. The resulting work, Man and the City, which officially secured the world's fair bid but remained unbuilt, carefully drew on the legacies of most great exhibitions, especially those of the nineteenth century, in order to conceive of sufficiently heroic structures making immanent novel forms of human interaction, social control, and the technical organisation of space. In 1967, this was to suggest a new world historical project—in a space existing for only six months but crowded with 50 million visitors—promoting senses of fraternal self-awareness through the unrelenting promise of progress. The resulting well-known Expo 67 theme, Man and His World, was a paean to contemporary humanism first used by the van Ginkels and their architect allies to reject the most enduring symbols of world exhibitions: the nation-state and its emblematic architecture. They imagined new kinds of architecture that could somehow engender new senses of political consciousness (inspired by, for example, UNESCO or the celebrated Family of Man photography exhibition of 1955) outside nationalist chauvinism. This was a vision of late modernity: a transitional form of political subjectivity still clinging to the shared passions of the citizen (thus for the polis ) before being subsumed by mass culture—in other words, a moment during which nationalisms could still be channelled into alternative forms of political belonging free of narrow self-interest. The belief marked every aspect of the van Ginkels early plans and had half-lives in two consequential works: the theme pavilions Man the Producer and Habitat 67, which, with outward emphasis on the aesthetics and technics of innovative structures (and mass production), were seen as fulfilling the ambitions of the megastructural movement in the 1960s. As such, theses architectures of late modernity reflected a markedly modernist conviction of long duration: on the one hand, an abiding faith in technological salvation and, on the other hand, the sense of some liberative social mass giving rise to a new citizen of the world. At the very same moment, this universalism was fraught with ambiguity: on the one hand, any abiding faith in techno-scientific salvation was shaken in the aftermath of global war and the terror of nuclear holocaust; on the other hand, assumed geopolitical ideals were being upended, however temporarily, by, say, decolonisation and resulting alternative global alignments on a postwar world's fair). Expo 67, perhaps the most consequential twentieth-century world's fair in terms of utopian hopes of modern architecture, was prey to these and related desires to reinvigorate the modern project of uniting instrumental reason, mass edification, and popular spectacle in a genuinely new public realm. It would irrevocably shape the ways in which Canada, as a host nation purposely celebrating its centennial in the ambit of a world's fair, was to confront its collective sense of cultural representation and global belonging.",1562250811,,Dissertations & Theses," Riar, Inderbir SinghRiarSinghInderbirRiar, Inderbir Singh",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3433388611 , 88687402 , 66569 , 9781321064391 , 3629458 , 3629458", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321064391, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562250811?accountid=14496," 0334 Canadian history , 0582 Modern history , 0729 Architecture"," 0334 Canadian history , 0582 Modern history , 0729 Architecture"," 0334 Canadian history , 0582 Modern history , 0729 Architecture",," 0334 Canadian history , 0582 Modern history , 0729 Architecture"," Canadian history , Modern history , Architecture"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Expo 67 , Habitat 67 , Megastructures , Van ginkel, Blanche lemco , Van ginkel, daniel , World's fairs",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Expo+67%2C+or+the+Architecture+of+Late+Modernity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Riar%2C+Inderbir+Singh&amp;isbn=9781321064391&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Transcending the avant-garde: The &lt;i&gt;angura&lt;/i&gt; posters of Yokoo Tadanori,"My thesis explores the social and political conditions under which the work of Yokoo Tadanori (born 1936) emerged as emblematic of the 1960s. In particular I focus on his silkscreen posters created as part of the theatrical productions of several angura or underground troupes. With a close reading of three of his iconic posters, I explore the ways Yokoo used text and image to simultaneously illuminate and frustrate one another. I unpack the textual and iconographic evidence that demonstrates Yokoo's intentional positioning of his work towards a global audience despite the limited venues in which this work was initially shown. I evaluate how Yokoo's employment of kitsch created a brash visual affront to viewers while also addressing topics that were deemed to be in bad taste such as the legacy of Japanese imperialism. I ground Yokoo's artistic practice within the multidisciplinary avant-garde art scene of 1960s Japan, connecting his work to other well-known Japanese collectives such as the Hi Red Center and the broader Fluxus movement. Finally, I connect Yokoo's use of text, language, and imagery to the tactics of the angura playwrights as well as larger views on nonlinear structures of time and the formation of culture. I assert that Yokoo's visual elements created a disruption in which viewers could consider the structures and systems of nationality through emblems and stereotypes, particularly within the voracious consumer society of the postwar era. In this way, Yokoo acted to galvanize a reconsideration of the everyday in order to produce broader social and political changes.",1562523151,,Dissertations & Theses," Moeller, Mary KathrynMoellerKathrynMaryMoeller, Mary Kathryn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3434728911 , 90413462 , 66569 , 9781321071887 , 1561636 , 1561636", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321071887, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1562523151?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Angura , Avant-garde , Japan , Posters , Tadanori, yokoo",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transcending+the+avant-garde%3A+The+angura+posters%0Aof+Yokoo+Tadanori&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moeller%2C+Mary+Kathryn&amp;isbn=9781321071887&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Habitat archipelago: A geofuturist proposal for architecture in the Anthropocene,"In the age of the Anthropocene, drastic ecological changes are needed to stop global climate change that will not be realized through technology alone. We need the assistance of socio-political movements as well as the integration of disciplines in order to be successful. This research analyzes the successes and failures of the Environmental Movement, beginning in the 1960s, as well as its integration of art, architecture, landscape, and technology in comparisons to their modern day environmental influences. By examining nature, through its various forms and ideologies, this research also seeks innovative ways to integrate disciplines as a means for understanding the process of social change. Nature and technology can be designed symbiotically through architecture. However, this change can only be achieved through the support and subsequent propagation of this idea though culture. Therefore, architecture's processes must include sociological functions as well as ecological ones to redefine the relationship between Nature and Culture. As the culmination of this research, equipped with a new understanding of the nature-culture relationship, a theoretical architectural proposal seeks to engage the issues surrounding architecture's unique ability to propagate social change and mediate between nature and technology.",1563359915,,Dissertations & Theses," Lapano, Jessica M.LapanoM.JessicaLapano, Jessica M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3436812451 , 90464452 , 66569 , 9781321079029 , 1561948 , 1561948", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321079029, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1563359915?accountid=14496," 0404 Climate Change , 0640 Sustainability , 0729 Architecture"," 0404 Climate Change , 0640 Sustainability , 0729 Architecture"," 0404 Climate Change , 0640 Sustainability , 0729 Architecture",," 0404 Climate Change , 0640 Sustainability , 0729 Architecture"," Climate Change , Sustainability , Architecture"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Earth sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Habitat+archipelago%3A+A+geofuturist+proposal+for+architecture+in+the+Anthropocene&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lapano%2C+Jessica+M.&amp;isbn=9781321079029&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""The Rhyming Monsieur and the Spanish plot"": Transnational dimensions of early modern theater in Western Europe","The birth of permanent, secular, and popular theater in sixteenth and seventeenth century Europe gave rise to some of the most famous names in western literature, including Molière, Lope de Vega, and Shakespeare. For centuries, early modern playwrights have been celebrated as cultural heroes in their respective homelands, but their status as `national' figures--intimately connected to a specific linguistic heritage--belies the fact that the creation, performance, and publication of their enduring works took place within a complex network of transnational and translingual exchange. Western European theater in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries was driven by the movement of texts, people, practices, and ideas between the stages of London, Madrid, and Paris. The theatrical practices that emerged in these capitals arose out of regional trends in demographics, urban social organization, the consolidation of monarchical authority, print culture, trade, travel, and nascent nationalism. As a result, these practices shared not only obvious similarities, but also systems of mutual influence. Notably, the dramatic content appearing on Europe's urban stages reflected persistent patterns of acknowledged and unacknowledged translation, adaptation, and appropriation that contradict traditional assumptions of stable national literary canons. The widespread borrowing of plots, themes, and even entire scripts across geopolitical boundaries generated a dialogue of intense competition between the various European theater capitals and their representative playwrights in attempts to locate and segregate authentic national identities. These debates--compounded by significant cross-cultural currents in staging, scenery, properties, music, and dance--reveal that the early modern theater, both as physical space and creative act, became a place where individuals and groups experienced and made sense of the relationship between the familiar and the foreign. This dissertation explores the entwined histories of performance, publication, commodities exchange, human migration, and cultural identity to illustrate the manifold ways in which theater provided the people of early modern Europe with a window onto the wider world.",1566477524,,Dissertations & Theses," McCormick, Colleen M.McCormickM.ColleenMcCormick, Colleen M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3447373621 , 90699122 , 66569 , 9781321103649 , 3631603 , 3631603", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321103649, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1566477524?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0578 History , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0335 European history , 0578 History , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0335 European history , 0578 History , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0335 European history , 0578 History , 0641 Performing Arts"," European history , History , Performing Arts"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Early modern europe , London , Madrid , Paris , Theater , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22The+Rhyming+Monsieur+and+the+Spanish+plot%22%3A+Transnational+dimensions+of+early+modern+theater+in+Western+Europe&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCormick%2C+Colleen+M.&amp;isbn=9781321103649&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Entanglements of ""Living Heritage"": Ecomuseum Development in Rural China","Museums are gaining increasing attention throughout the world for their ability to foster social inclusion, intercultural dialogue, and collaboration in practices of heritage management, exhibition, and interpretation. This dissertation aims to contribute a critical perspective on museums as agents of social change through an exploration of new museological practices in contemporary China. Through an ethnography of the ecomuseum, I unravel the assumptions and expectations of implementing a Western concept based on notions of community participation, empowerment, and the democratization of heritage in the context of a transforming China. In my ethnographic account of the multifaceted politics faced by ecomuseums, I question how power and authority are mediated through these civic institutions and how central aspects of museum and heritage practices are being redressed in Chinese society. This study exposes how ecomuseums in China are a result of global processes and positioned as part of a heritage protection movement and museum development boom to promote cultural nationalism, a ""civilized"" China, and state edicts of rural development in impoverished ethnic minority regions. Detailing the implications of government-led ecomuseum development in ethnic villages in southwest China, and the specific case of Huaili ecomuseum, in Guangxi, I interrogate the institutionalization of heritage and cultural landscapes through processes of exhibition, museumification, and the revaluing of culture. I explore the ecomuseum as a social space of cross-cultural encounter and friction through which local actors grapple with conditions of cultural governance and the entanglements cultural difference and a national heritage discourse. In my critical analysis of collected ethnographic narratives over 15 months of fieldwork from state-directed interest groups, Chinese technocrats, and villager informants involved in the institutionalization of heritage, I present the complex arrangements and interactions that take place through the ecomuseum context and how subject positionalities shift and claims to heritage, identity, and voice are negotiated, regulated, and contested. This study contributes to the anthropology of China and museum and heritage studies, and aims to push new directions in the study of community heritage and museums, in offering a critical perspective of the political nature of ecomuseums in non-Western contexts, such as China.",1609720557,,Dissertations & Theses," Nitzky, WilliamNitzkyWilliamNitzky, William",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3457361271 , 87773982 , 66569 , 9781321129717 , 3633315 , 3633315", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321129717, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1609720557?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0436 Cultural Resources Management , 0730 Museum studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0436 Cultural Resources Management , 0730 Museum studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0436 Cultural Resources Management , 0730 Museum studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0436 Cultural Resources Management , 0730 Museum studies"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies , Cultural Resources Management , Museum studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , China , Ecomuseums , Ethnic minority , Ethnography , Heritage , Rural development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Entanglements+of+%22Living+Heritage%22%3A+Ecomuseum+Development+in+Rural+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Nitzky%2C+William&amp;isbn=9781321129717&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Becoming Bhojpuri: Producing cinema and producing language in post-liberalization India,"In the last twenty years, India's neoliberal policies have transformed the relationship between cities and villages, privileging urban middle-class consumers over rural laborers even as the pace of rural-to-urban migration has increased. Already-grim conditions for migrant laborers in Mumbai are exacerbated by slum resettlement projects and political movements that call for the outright removal of poor migrants. Simultaneously, economic liberalization has encouraged new forms of urban leisure exemplified by the multiplex theater's emergence in Indian cities in 1997. Built by transnational corporate partnerships, and marketed and priced towards upper-middle- class urban cinemagoers, the multiplex has rearranged filmmaking and cinemagoing alike. Meanwhile, the nascent (or re-nascent) Bhojpuri film industry, considered ""backwards"" in comparison to mainstream middle-class Hindi cinema, depends on pre-liberalization financial networks, exhibits in preexisting single-screen theaters, and brings into being a lower-class migrant audience. I demonstrate how processes of production, distribution, and exhibition of cinema in Bhojpuri have produced new ideas about Bhojpuri's linguistic content and its speakers' social location following economic liberalization, both in Mumbai, a major site of labor migration, and in the Bhojpuri homeland in rural Uttar Pradesh and Bihar. I investigate four major processes through which cinema, language, migration, and identity intersect: 1) the production of cinema as a constitutive element in the production of language; 2) the circulation of cinema as a material phenomenon that makes physical spaces and geographic boundaries meaningful; 3) the migration of people and movement of media as circuits in which linguistic and geographic identity categories are consolidated and distributed, and 4) the emergence of relatively stable identity categories that are seen to inhere in spaces of cinematic exhibition and in cinema itself. I situate Bhojpuri historically in a milieu of rapidly changing language politics, and ethnographically in a neoliberal field of increased capital circulation, movement from villages to cities, and technological change.",1612467669,,Dissertations & Theses," Hardy, Kathryn C.HardyC.KathrynHardy, Kathryn C.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3462590581 , 91060782 , 66569 , 9781321141740 , 3633985 , 3633985", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321141740, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1612467669?accountid=14496," 0291 Modern language , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0291 Modern language , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0291 Modern language , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0291 Modern language , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," Modern language , Cultural anthropology , South Asian Studies , Film studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Bhojpuri , Cinema , Discourse , India , Language , Media",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Becoming+Bhojpuri%3A+Producing+cinema+and+producing+language+in+post-liberalization+India&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hardy%2C+Kathryn+C.&amp;isbn=9781321141740&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The struggle for a second transition in South Africa: Uprising, development and precarity in the post-apartheid city","This dissertation explores the limitations of post-apartheid liberation in the specific environment of Durban, South Africa. It takes a social movement of shack dwellers, Abahlali baseMjondolo, as a looking glass into urban debates concerned with the wellbeing of some of South Africa's most marginalized communities. As the country struggles to deal with the ongoing crises of mass poverty, inequality, and unemployment, the government has responded with a range of developmental projects. At the same time, poor people around the country have protested injustice in record numbers, rivaling levels of unrest in any other part of the world. A mix of state repression and increased governmental redistribution of wealth has been the official response. This study explores these contentious issues by placing them in the context of South Africa's Second Transition. More broadly, the approach situates the study at multiple geographical scales of analysis from the global to the continental, and the regional to the city. In so doing, it tries to de-center the nation-state as a central unit of analysis without losing site of the specificity of South Africa's challenges. The dissertation begins by exploring national debates around the resurgence of social movements in post-apartheid South Africa, before moving on to approach to the issue of racialization as a central divisive factor within South Africa and in many of the global uprisings that have occurred since 2011. The study shifts to explore state responses to these moments of unrest and rebellion from below by thinking about the rise of a South African developmental state over the past decade. The developmental state in Durban is examined through one of the country's largest public housing projects. Finally, the dissertation explores the other side of the coin to the state's response to movements: beyond developmental initiatives too often lies naked repression. The violence that racialized communities living in slums throughout South Africa face is explored through a variety of debates around the peculiarities of precarity beyond the global North. The study closes by putting the findings into conversation with Mahmood Mamdani's seminal work on the legacy of African colonialism.",1612601393,,Dissertations & Theses," Al-Bulushi, YousufAl-BulushiYousufAl-Bulushi, Yousuf",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3462678271 , 89195652 , 66569 , 9781321140859 , 3633920 , 3633920", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321140859, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1612601393?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0366 Geography"," 0293 African Studies , 0366 Geography"," 0293 African Studies , 0366 Geography",," 0293 African Studies , 0366 Geography"," African Studies , Geography"," Social sciences , Post-apartheid , Social theory , South africa , Urban geography",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+struggle+for+a+second+transition+in+South+Africa%3A+Uprising%2C+development+and+precarity+in+the+post-apartheid+city&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Al-Bulushi%2C+Yousuf&amp;isbn=9781321140859&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"David and Goliath: How Microbreweries Are Defeating The Giants,"The success of microbreweries over the last thirty years represents an increasingly important characteristic of small businesses in a globalized economy: the flexibility of the small business structure allows companies to more effectively adapt to increasing consumer concern regarding sustainability, the local economy, and the environment. Within that framework, to what extent does consumer awareness of social concerns weigh more heavily than cost? Does the popularity and growth of microbreweries mirror a social shift that increasingly rejects the exploitation inherent in a free and globalized market system? Research predominantly focuses on economic and historic analysis of the growth of microbreweries and the development of the local business movement within the context of a neoliberal economy. Also, I examine how brewing developed in the United states as a distinctly local enterprise, yet was eclipsed by large national breweries in a post-Prohibition, post-war economy that was increasingly global in nature. David Harvey suggests that neoliberal policy in the 1980s created a system whereby ""International competition is seen as healthy since it improves efficiency and productivity, lowers prices, and thereby controls inflationary tendencies."" Yet it is within this very structure that craft brewing is reigniting the local business economy. The project also examines the ecological benefits of craft breweries by looking at their environmental studies and programs. In addition to analyzing microbreweries, I include a comparative analysis of other successful local and ethical business models, such as dairy and coffee, to establish whether those trends represent a more long term consumer shift in favor of more ethical business practices.",1613178934,,Dissertations & Theses," Sahs, Geoffrey W.SahsW.GeoffreySahs, Geoffrey W.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3463727051 , 91084042 , 66569 , 9781321147445 , 1564073 , 1564073", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321147445, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1613178934?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history"," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history"," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history",," 0337 American history , 0509 Economic history"," American history , Economic history"," Social sciences , Brewing economics , Brewing history , Local brewing , Local business",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=David+and+Goliath%3A+How+Microbreweries+Are+Defeating+The+Giants&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sahs%2C+Geoffrey+W.&amp;isbn=9781321147445&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Gender, family, and new styles of fatherhood: Modernization and globalization in Japan","Ikumen, meaning fathers with small children who are—or look like they are—actively involved in childrearing are a new phenomenon in contemporary Japan, despite the prevalent images of patriarchic and absent fatherhood. But why and how did yesterday's notorious company soldiers turn into today's ikumen ? This dissertation interrogates this supposedly drastic shift in the view and the conduct of fatherhood as a cultural practice on historical, political economic, and linguistic grounds. Drawing on fieldwork, mass media, and historical analysis, I explore how new styles of fatherhood have been constructed and how they embody broader social issues of gender, class, and modernity and globalization. Gender roles in the modern family since the late nineteenth century have been strained, and ikumen will allegedly liberate both men and women to achieve the ideal of ""work-life balance"" in a ""gender-equal society."" Examination of various genres of language, from metapragmatic comments to the advertising of nursery items, however, suggests that the ideology of gender roles is naturalized and ""male features"" are appropriated to lead men into the ""female"" sphere of the home. I argue that this discourse represents the heteroglossic nature of language, and that our speech, influenced by accustomed thoughts, paradoxically strengthens that discourse despite our intentions. Ikumen are not only connected to concerns about gender, but also are predicated on Japan's historical and ongoing fantasy of modernity and globalization. From the label ikumen, to state and local campaigns for male participation in childcare, to the use of terms of address for parents, the idealized West and its monolithic images of stylish and active fatherhood and romantic couplehood are covertly exploited. As a whole, the ikumen movement ends up creating an ""imagined community,"" in which ""globalism"" is believed to help one obtain a more authentic and global ""self"" through childrearing. I argue that the ikumen movement presents the perpetual but concealed power hierarchy of modernity, and that Japan and Japanese people docilely appropriate this historical truth, institutionalizing the counterhegemony as the new hegemony and as a form of cultural capital in the context of a disturbingly low birthrate and a sluggish economy.",1613239729,,Dissertations & Theses," Oyama, AtsukoOyamaAtsukoOyama, Atsuko",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3463788291 , 91086652 , 66569 , 9781321145267 , 3634257 , 3634257", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321145267, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1613239729?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0628 Individual & family studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies , Individual & family studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Anthropology , Family , Fatherhood , Gender , Globalization , Japan",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gender%2C+family%2C+and+new+styles+of+fatherhood%3A+Modernization+and+globalization+in+Japan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Oyama%2C+Atsuko&amp;isbn=9781321145267&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""La rosa en las tinieblas: Dau al Set, Postismo y la vanguardia latente (1945-1953)","La rosa en las tinieblas: Dau al Set, Postismo y la vanguardia latente (1945-1953) [ A Rose in the Dark: Dau al Set, Postismo, and the Latent Avant-garde (1945-1953) ] explores Spain's literary avant-garde in the early years of the Cold War. Writing against the widespread presumption of the movement's disappearance following Franco's victory in the Spanish Civil War, I trace elements of continuity by focusing on four poets associated with two groups-the Madrid-based Postismo and the Barcelona-based Dau al Set–whose work developed on the margins of Spain's literary scene but became immensely influential following its recovery in the 1960s and 70s. Divided into two parts titled after a quote by Bertolt Brecht–""Questioning realism"" and ""Questioning reality""–my discussion focuses on how their work calls into question the supposed opposition between the avant-garde and realism, relates to other forms of cultural production–music, cinema, painting–at a time when literature was under strong pressure from Francoist censorship, and connects with the humor associated with the early 20 th -century avant-garde and popular postwar publications such as La Codorniz. While much of the narrative imposed by the avant-garde itself insists on its historical and spiritual relation to Romanticism-as epitomized by Octavio Paz's famous essay Los hijos del limo –, my analysis explores how the postwar avant–garde positions itself in relation to the literary controversies of its time-including debate on the relative merits of the avant-garde versus social-realism, and of surrealism versus existentialism-, during a period of intense political, social, and cultural change. Thus, I demonstrate how, on the one hand, turning its back on the nationalist aesthetics promoted by the regime, the literary avant-garde in Spain casts itself as internationalist, while, on the other, it continues to derive techniques and inspiration from Spanish artistic circles–especially following the return to Spain in the mid 1940s of Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí, both of whom collaborated with the members of Dau al Set. I further analyze an understudied aspect of these movements: their relation to popular humor, used by magazines like La Codorniz as a way of getting round the Francoist censors, while also establishing connections with the pre-war avant-garde (for example, through the exiled Ramón Gómez de la Serna's contributions). In keeping with these movements' interartistic and transnational nature, and in contrast to previous scholarship on these authors, my analysis cuts across fields, disciplines, and linguistic traditions in its discussion of the works of Carlos Edmundo de Ory and Juan Eduardo Cirlot (in Spanish), Joan Brossa (in Catalan), and Brazilian author João Cabral de Melo Neto (in Portuguese), whose contribution to Dau al Set was essential in defining the group's politics and aesthetics.",1614471949,,Dissertations & Theses," Mateu-Adrover, MelcionMateu-AdroverMelcionMateu-Adrover, Melcion",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3466830691 , 88214752 , 66569 , 9781321162554 , 3635273 , 3635273", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321162554, Spanish, Spanish,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1614471949?accountid=14496," 0298 Modern literature , 0440 European Studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0440 European Studies"," 0298 Modern literature , 0440 European Studies",," 0298 Modern literature , 0440 European Studies"," Modern literature , European Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Catalan literature , Luso-brazilian literature , Spanish literature",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=La+rosa+en+las+tinieblas%3A+Dau+al+Set%2C+Postismo+y+la+vanguardia+latente+%281945-1953%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mateu-Adrover%2C+Melcion&amp;isbn=9781321162554&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Kindred Sounds: Afro-South Asian Musical Intersections in Jazz and Hip Hop,"This project traces the resonances between African American and South Asian diasporic musical collaborations during the postwar jazz and post-9/11 hip hop eras in the U.S. It challenges scholarship in ethnomusicology and popular music studies that tether these cross-cultural exchanges to similar practices by white artists—connecting Afro-South Asian hip hop to Madonna's commercialization of South Asian style commodities; and linking postwar jazz's use of Indian music to The Beatles. What happens when we consider South Asian sonic excursions of black musicians as distinct from those of their white counterparts? Using interviews and archival materials, this project argues that the South Asian inflections of mid-twentieth-century jazz and of twenty-first-century hip hop must be understood as elements in a specifically Afro-South Asian sonic trajectory. It thereby illuminates Afro-South Asian hip hop and jazz as alternative sites of knowledge formation—forged among minoritized subjects—that resist dominant systems of whiteness and appropriation. This dissertation pivots around three interrelated claims: 1) Many African American and South Asian musicians involved in creating collaborative sound(s) during the mid-twentieth and twenty-first centuries understood their engagement as distinct from similar projects by white musicians; 2) Afro-South Asian productions in 1960s/1970s jazz and twenty-first century hip hop not only took place alongside larger historical contexts, but also served as sites from which African American and South Asian (diasporic) artists sought to form cross-cultural, interracial, and transnational political alliances; and 3) These racial, cultural, and spatial coalitions in Afro-South Asian hip hop and jazz were inextricably tied to formations of gender and sexuality. This dissertation is divided into four chapters. The first two chapters explore the recordings of jazz musicians, John Coltrane and Miles Davis, respectively, and illustrate the ways in which their appropriations of South Asian music articulated and shaped larger U.S. domestic and transnational Afro-Asian connections of the civil rights and black power movements. In particular, I argue that Coltrane utilized South Asian music in order to proffer a transnational political vision of social justice, and that Davis understood South Asian sound as central to black masculinist political consciousness of the 1970s. The final two chapters examine the role of South Asian and South Asian diasporic music and artists in hip hop during the early twenty-first century. The third chapter investigates Truth Hurts' ""Addictive"" and Erick Sermon's ""React"" to argue that these songs' sampling of South Asian sound bridged African American and South Asian American communities in a post-9/11 period when such connections were divorced. The final chapter examines the career of South Asian American hip hop singer, Raje Shwari, and how she manipulated her voice in ways that articulated queer desires when such desires were rendered illegible within U.S., Indian, and the South Asian diasporic popular culture and discourse.",1614472337,,Dissertations & Theses," Powell, Elliott HunterPowellHunterElliottPowell, Elliott Hunter",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3466840741 , 87092742 , 66569 , 9781321162776 , 3635293 , 3635293", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321162776, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1614472337?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0413 Music , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0413 Music , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0413 Music , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0323 American studies , 0343 Asian American Studies , 0413 Music , 0631 Ethnic studies"," African American Studies , American studies , Asian American Studies , Music , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , African american , Afro-asian , Hip hop , Jazz , Queer , South asian american",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Kindred+Sounds%3A+Afro-South+Asian+Musical+Intersections+in+Jazz+and+Hip+Hop&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Powell%2C+Elliott+Hunter&amp;isbn=9781321162776&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Dispossessive Acts: Aesthetics of Accumulation,"This dissertation explores the implications of material and psychic dispossession for the aesthetic mediation of the social contradictions of accumulation in late capitalism. As it focuses in particular on solo performances that stage confrontations between workers and machines, this project analyzes the politics and the political economies of aesthetics in terms of how artistic practices waste, distort, produce dissonance within, or theatricalize the social differentials that are critical to the spatio-temporal extension of capitalism within the United States. While I turn to artistic production to synthesize aspects of political economy and philosophies of psychic life, I develop accounts of aesthetic critique that chart the production of difference inside of conditions of compulsion, restriction and expropriation where such production would seem impossible. This project begins with two chapters that analyze performances that attempt to merge their subjects into the sites of commodities and fixed capital. In chapter one, I read the 1972 novel Car by Harry Crews and argue that through it (and other aesthetic projects with which it is contemporaneous) an emergent aesthetic form of estranged proximity to the contradictions of late capitalism takes shape. Chapter two turns to work by the artist Pope.L, in particular his 1997 performance ATM Piece, and argues that his aesthetics of estrangement disturb the municipal-security apparatuses of the late 20 th century global city project. The final two chapters turn to performances that theatricalize the expropriation of particular bodily capacities at work. Chapter three focuses on gesture, as it turns to assembly line performances by Lucille Ball and Tehching Hsieh in order to argue that their badly timed gestures at work function as tactics of evasion within the site of management. The fourth and final chapter then focuses on vocalization in the work of the artist Sharon Hayes and the social movement of Occupy. Here, I argue that their vocal performances produce alternative economies of noisy and dissonant vocalization within conditions that would restrict them. Throughout, I maintain that dispossessive acts are characterized by their proliferations of difference and their miscalculations of the coordinates of a new territory of capital accumulation.",1614473021,,Dissertations & Theses," Pittman, AlexPittmanAlexPittman, Alex",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3466840991 , 88214842 , 66569 , 9781321162752 , 3635291 , 3635291", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321162752, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1614473021?accountid=14496," 0641 Performing Arts , 0650 Aesthetics"," 0641 Performing Arts , 0650 Aesthetics"," 0641 Performing Arts , 0650 Aesthetics",," 0641 Performing Arts , 0650 Aesthetics"," Performing Arts , Aesthetics"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Communication and the arts , Accumulation , Aesthetics , Dispossession , Late capitalism , Performance art",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dispossessive+Acts%3A+Aesthetics+of+Accumulation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Pittman%2C+Alex&amp;isbn=9781321162752&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Sovereigns of the Golden Twilight: Law, land, and sacrificial labor in Ghana","This dissertation examines the often hidden or unremarked cultural, economic, spiritual, and social effects of Ghana's mining industry, which is widely lauded as a great economic success in one of Africa's most celebrated democracies. The project, based on extensive ethnographic and historical research, focuses on Obuasi, a legendary, ethno-cosmopolitan mining town in Asante. The town has long been home to a deep underground gold mine. More recently, it has been the site of bitter controversies surrounding drastic mine labor retrenchments and destructive surface extraction of the precious metal. Obuasi played a central role in the Asante Empire and in British colonialism in the Gold Coast. It is the site of Africa's second most plentiful gold mine and now stands as a key pillar of the country's economy, contributing to Ghana's status as Africa's second largest gold producer. In many ways a company town, Obuasi is effectively run by a leading transnational corporation, AngloGold Ashanti (AGA). It is currently the site of Ghana's most acute mining conflicts, following the dispossession and destruction of many indigenous farmlands and streams, the declining political and spiritual legitimacy of traditional rulers, the casualization of mine labor, soaring youth unemployment, and the rise of an increasingly organized and militarized shadow labor force of small-scale miners (""galamseys""), among them ever more foreigners, especially Chinese. Various advocacy campaigns surrounding these conflicts in Obuasi culminated in the christening of AGA as ""the most irresponsible company in the world"" for 2010, a designation that entailed heavy consequences for the mine and its forms of shadow rule. Gold mining, at once Ghana's most profitable industry and its ""poisoned chalice,"" is one of the most significant domains of contemporary contests over postcolonial citizenship, ethnic belonging, and sovereignty. This ethnography asks, principally: what are the critical paradoxes and forms of life that often lie concealed in the shadows of the mining industry? How do these paradoxes and forms subtend Ghana's wide reputation as the key neoliberal ""rule of law"" success story for Africa - and for the Global South, more broadly? The study interrogates the many dimensions of these mining conflicts, including the clash of property regimes involved in them, the ways in which they often elude the formal court systems, and the shadow authorities that have arisen to provision, police, adjudicate, and otherwise govern this theater of struggle. The principal shadow authorities include the mining company, the informal miners' association, advocacy networks, and various indigenous, Islamic, and Christian religious figures, who furnish significant spiritual backing, symbolic power, and claims to legitimacy. I argue that these authorities operate, ambivalently, as forces of beneficence and terror – at once biopolitical and exceptional, earthly and otherworldly – and exercise sovereign-like rule over territories and populations in the shadows of the formal legal system; the latter itself being founded on the dual existence of a colonially constructed customary law and a liberal state legal regime. The struggles and collaborations among these shadow authorities are fashioning the economic, cultural, and social lives of the Ghanaians who inhabit their worlds. This is especially so for those who sense that their lands, labor, and sources of livelihood have been sacrificed to a mine and to a state - to conceptions of ""sovereign wealth"" - that do not offer them viable sources for future life. I also argue that multivalent sacrificial logics fuel reckonings of destruction and dispossession. Further, these logics crucially underwrite the bold spirit of those who seek to labor for land and gold, themselves sacred spirits, and to claim forms of entitlement that state and traditional rulers no longer secure for them. More broadly, I argue that the mounting discontent and advocacy movements surrounding these conflicts in mining towns have converged with soaring global mineral prices to produce Ghana's recent ""upward adjustment"" reforms for its mining industry. In these reforms, the nation attempts to claim significantly enhanced state takings and to roll back many of the most dramatic liberalization provisions of structural adjustment. I examine the Ghanaian case as a pacesetter, at the forefront of a larger trend toward ""upward"" sovereign takings across many nations in the resource-rich South, perhaps auguring novel futures for prevailing modes of law, sovereignty, capitalism, and political authority. In so doing, I engage and complicate anthropological and social theoretical debates on law, sovereignty, politics, moral and spiritual economies, cosmology and the sacred, and cultures of capitalism, particularly in the postcolonial world.

The idea that The White-Haired Girl was originally inspired by folklore has often been emphasized by the Chinese literary establishment to make it appear as a collective creation of the nation and interpreted by scholars as evidence of the Communist Party’s successful appropriation of popular social values for revolutionary propaganda during the war. This study goes beyond such claims by examining the roles of the individual writers, literary theorists and dramatists who produced The White-Haired Girl to reveal how themes and forms from Chinese folk culture were converted into artistic signs of the social authenticity of the revolution, in a process I label revolutionary folklorism . Examining the ways that romantic nationalist ideas of folkloric authenticity mediated modern literary and theatrical aesthetics and revolutionary politics in China during the war, I aim to resituate Chinese Communist cultural production within a larger global history of modernism’s attempts to overcome tradition through reconfigurations of elite and popular cultures. Although widely understood as originally inspired by an authentic oral folktale, the first chapter of this study argues instead that the narrative of The White Haired Girl was crafted by the little-known writer Shao Zinan, who utilized motifs of the fantastic from folklore and traditional fiction and drew upon modern literary, social-scientific and political imaginaries to depict the plight of women under rural patriarchy and offer Communist revolution as a vision of gender liberation. The second chapter of this dissertation examines how the Marxist literary critic Zhou Yang, head of the premiere Communist literary and artistic training institute during the war - the Lu Xun Art Academy, sponsored the production of The White- Haired Girl amidst criticisms that its narrative was too fantastic by re-interpreting Shao’s story in light of theories of Russian literary aesthetics, Soviet Socialist Realism and the Maoist ideology of national liberation. The third chapter of this study examines the intersecting legacies of the Western and Soviet modernist theaters and the early twentieth-century movement to reform traditional Chinese theater that the drama theorist Zhang Geng drew upon as he supervised the stage production of The White-Haired Girl at the Lu Xun Academy. Through Zhang’s influence, the music-drama was conceived as type of national revolutionary Gesamtkunstwerk , or “total art-work,” that could maximize the emotional affect and political impact of the work on the basis of a formal integration of elements of Chinese and Western and folk and elite performing arts, revealing unexpected traces of the influence of Wagnerian aesthetics on the revolutionary literature and art of twentieth-century China. This study concludes by considering how The White-Haired Girl represented a unique historical repurposing of traditional Chinese modes of literary production on the basis of local folkloric sources to apply a Marxist critique of ideology to popular religious consciousness in China, an operation which outlined the Communist revolution within the paradoxical discursive figure of a legend about the falsity of legends or an anti-mythological myth.",1615099254,,Dissertations & Theses," Bohnenkamp, Max LowellBohnenkampLowellMaxBohnenkamp, Max Lowell",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3468256901 , 88211552 , 66569 , 9781321222333 , 3638535 , 3638535", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321222333, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1615099254?accountid=14496," 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music , 0465 Theater"," 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music , 0465 Theater"," 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music , 0465 Theater",," 0305 Asian literature , 0342 Asian Studies , 0358 Folklore , 0413 Music , 0465 Theater"," Asian literature , Asian Studies , Folklore , Music , Theater"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , China , Chinese literature , Communism , Folklorism , Revolutionary literature , Theater",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Turning+ghosts+into+people%3A+%E2%80%9CThe+White-Haired+Girl%E2%80%9D%2C%0Arevolutionary+folklorism+and+the+politics+of+aesthetics+in+modern+China&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bohnenkamp%2C+Max+Lowell&amp;isbn=9781321222333&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Beyond the democratic state: Anti-authoritarian interventions in democratic theory,"Though democracy has achieved widespread global popularity, its meaning has become increasingly vacuous and citizen confidence in democratic governments continues to erode. I respond to this tension by articulating a vision of democracy inspired by anti-authoritarian theory and social movement practice. By anti-authoritarian, I mean a commitment to individual liberty, a skepticism toward centralized power, and a belief in the capacity of self-organization. This dissertation fosters a conversation between an anti-authoritarian perspective and democratic theory: What would an account of democracy that begins from these three commitments look like? In the first two chapters, I develop an anti-authoritarian account of freedom and power. In Chapter I, mobilizing insights from libertarians and republicans, I offer an account of freedom that is divorced from self-sovereignty and committed to non-domination. In Chapter II, utilizing work in anarchist anthropology, I show why freedom as non-domination is incompatible with the state, and that an alternative to the statist organization of power is possible. While a centripetal logic unifies society's power in a Leviathan, a centrifugal logic disperses power across many non-sovereign nodes. In the second half of the dissertation, in order to elaborate what centrifugal power may look like in our contemporary context, I focus on two core anti-authoritarian social movement practices: direct action and networked organization. In Chapter III, I argue that direct action, a practice that enacts collective power, is democratic to the extent that it upsets power inequalities and domination, and creates spaces for others to exercise political power. In Chapter IV, I argue that networks enable two ends that are often thought to be in tension: coordination, and self-governance, on the one hand, and diversity and pluralism, on the other. In contrast to representative elections and directly democratic assemblies, however, networks do not require a well-defined people, a centralized decision-making body, or even a single, unifying decision. Throughout the dissertation, I argue against the platitude of the ""democratic state"" in favor of a democracy against the state. I conclude by re-imagining democracy as the dispersion of power.",1615100531,,Dissertations & Theses," Bernhardt, Brian CarlBernhardtCarlBrianBernhardt, Brian Carl",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3468271041 , 88735792 , 66569 , 9781321171112 , 3635786 , 3635786", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321171112, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1615100531?accountid=14496," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science"," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science"," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science",," 0422 Philosophy , 0615 Political science"," Philosophy , Political science"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Anarchism , Democracy , Direct action , Libertarianism , Networks , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Beyond+the+democratic+state%3A+Anti-authoritarian+interventions+in+democratic+theory&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bernhardt%2C+Brian+Carl&amp;isbn=9781321171112&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"To Serve the Present Age A Critique of 19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century New Measures and 21st Century Fresh Expressions,"1.1 The Question/Problem: The United Methodist Church in America is shrinking. In response to this truth, I researched historical practical divinity practices in America that grew and sustained the church in the past. Many of these practices are still applicable to serve our present age. How do we make converts in the most effective way to usher in the reign of God and represent an incarnational Christ to the world so that the world becomes Christian through social holiness practices and holy beliefs? Some theologians think practice makes perfect while others insist upon holy assurance for salvation. What practical practices work most excellently to serve our present age? 1.2 Methodology: In this dissertation, I identify, examine, compare, and contrast applicable and historically consistent and effective practices employed by these church movements in the nineteenth and twenty-first centuries to gain new converts and produce church growth. The introduction explains my calling to address how to best serve our present age and expresses my interest in John Wesley, Charles Finney, Phoebe Palmer, and Elaine Heath. In chapters 1 and 2, I begin with Charles Grandison Finney's New Measures as well as Phoebe Palmer's participation in the Holiness movement in the nineteenth century including theological opposition. Performing historical analysis on Finney's and Palmer's relative primary sources reveals their theology of call, scriptural emphasis, and social holiness practices. I identify the ""New Measures"" as promoted by Finney and Palmer as established by Wesley using primary and secondary sources. In chapters 3 and 4, I examine modern day fresh expressions as well as Elaine Heath's missional communities, a movement designed to promote a way of life for new converts and church growth. I include Heath's primary sources and her analysis of Phoebe Palmer's theology. In addition, I interviewed Heath on her work and how it connects Finney, Palmer, fresh expressions, and missional communities to participate in God's reign for our day and time. I attended a Bible Study where she expounded on scripture that illustrates Jesus' missional ministry. I discussed the opposition to fresh expressions as a means of understanding orthodox theology and accepting innovation as Holy Spirit empowerment. In chapter 5, my analysis compares and contrasts the new measures of the nineteenth century with the twenty-first century fresh expressions movement. I identify similarities and differences and address their innovation as a means to reveal successful evangelical church growth practices for present church leaders and communities that are sustaining over time for the purpose of making disciples to transform the world. Finally, I present the conclusion and analysis of my findings that successfully usher in the reign of God for practical divinity practices. 1.3 Conclusion: At the age of ten, it was during a revival that the tongue of fire touched me and called me to accept Jesus as the only way to salvation, set me on the path of faithful discipleship, and planted within me a fire in my belly to transform the world and usher in the Kingdom of God. During my first appointment as a minister in a small rural church, my conference recognized my gifts for church growth. At their request, the Board of Global Ministries trained me to plant churches. My training and experience as a church planter, church revitalization training, and tenure on District and Conference Boards of Congregational Development have allowed me to participate in church revitalization, church plants, and experience the power of the Holy Spirit blowing at the will of God and growing the Church of Jesus Christ. All of the churches that I have served have consistently produced new converts and grown in discipleship. It is my experience that the historically effective church practices of the nineteenth century revealed by this research produce a healthy Body of Christ on earth that authentically replicates the ministry of Jesus and ushers in the reign of God in America and throughout the world. In nineteenth century America, Finney's New Measures and Palmer's altar sanctification relied on Wesley's revival methods calling the American Church to radical change and theological overhaul, so that believers could become a people of method and service based in God's word. In the present age, fresh expressions and Elaine Heath call the church to a radical overhaul - a return to the model of Christianity as set forth by Christ and the apostles. This incarnational model is the bridge to the past that is Holy Spirit empowered, scripturally rooted, and affirms the call of laity and clergy, for the purpose of participating in social holiness that ushers in the reign of God in this present age. When we, the United Methodist Church, faithfully return to these practices, the Church of Jesus Christ will again grow and thrive so that it can follow Jesus, make disciples, and transform the world.",1615129217,,Dissertations & Theses," Michael, Suzanne Stewart GaineyMichaelStewart GaineySuzanneMichael, Suzanne Stewart Gainey",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3468285431 , 91185742 , 66569 , 9781321236873 , 3639355 , 3639355", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321236873, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1615129217?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0376 Divinity"," 0337 American history , 0376 Divinity"," 0337 American history , 0376 Divinity",," 0337 American history , 0376 Divinity"," American history , Divinity"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Charles finney , Elaine heath , Leadership , Phoebe palmer , Practical practices , Social holiness",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=To+Serve+the+Present+Age+A+Critique+of+19th%0ACentury+New+Measures+and+21st+Century+Fresh+Expressions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Michael%2C+Suzanne+Stewart+Gainey&amp;isbn=9781321236873&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""A Study of Civil Rights Leader, Labor Organizer, and Educator Jack Hunter O'Dell and His Contribution to the Institute for Community Leadership","This study appreciates the socialization of storytelling as the passing-on of daily living and experience with optimum possibility for influencing the lives of others (Merriam, 2002). In storytelling, interpretations of events and people are passed along with the expectation or hope of making meaningful connection with and for others. My research embarked upon the storytelling of a unique organizational experience that examines the significant and selective contributions of civil rights and labor organizer Jack O'Dell, to the development and enhancement of a nonviolence, educational organization -- the Institute for Community Leadership (ICL). Jack O'Dell's life has been one of profound engagement, activism, and leadership as he has assumed a front row seat in the navigation of some of society's gravest contradictions and inequities. Born on August 23, 1923 in Detroit, Michigan, O'Dell's service to our nation and to humanity includes as a Merchant Marine during the WWII fight against fascism, a labor organizer with the National Maritime Union, an Executive Committee member, fund developer, and Director of Voter Registration for Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), and an editor of Freedomways, historic journal of the Black freedom movement. O'Dell served as the International Relations Director for Operation PUSH and the National Rainbow Coalition, and as a campaign advisor on two presidential campaigns. The Institute for Community Leadership, an educational organization dedicated to closing the achievement gap along race and socioeconomic lines, owes its connection to O'Dell to his nearly 30 years of mentorship to ICL Director, Dr. Roy Wilson. Together they have together assured profound and meaningful integration of organizational participants from ages 11 to 85, in an ongoing series of sessions with O'Dell over this period. ICL organizers have sought O'Dell's analysis and input on its organizational development, educational trajectory, and integration into the global, historical context of the Civil Rights Movement in a series of over 80 meetings and retreats over 25 years. At least 60 of these sessions were recorded, with the vast majority remaining untranscribed and in audio form. My research gathered, transcribed, evaluated, and analyzed salient stories from this ample reservoir of exchange. Specifically, it sought to document O'Dell's response to ICL work, and ICL's integration of the teaching and learning that has come from this formative relationship. It analyzed and classified the stories through a narrative descriptive lens based on seven significant themes where key findings were examined, including, • The need for civil society organizations, then and now; • The role of internationalism; assisting participants in solving problems at home and learning about themselves, through others; developing relations with and studying the struggles of other peoples and nations; • The essential role of intergenerational relations to bridge the experience and theory of elders with younger generations, so the struggle does, in fact continue; • The vital need for intentful interracial relations in the Civil Rights Movement as well as the educational organization; • The science of community organizing, particularly providing constant, meaningful community activity, without straying off purpose or spreading organizational resources too thin; • The development of social change versus social service organization, including in its organizational priorities, methods of funding, personnel, and organizer development; • The science of survival, considerations for organizational longevity, including size and quantity, strength, developing a dual authority, and the development of qualities of an organizer including curiosity, courage, and reliability. The purpose of my study was to analyze lessons described above as they were applied to the association and working relationship of Jack O'Dell and the Institute by illustrating and providing insight into the work of ICL and its contribution and advocacy for community empowerment, educational equity, and social justice. O'Dell's contribution to ICL has been life giving. His life experience and rigorous, dialectical study have accorded him a remarkable mastery of the science of social change. He provides a unique political, economic, sociocultural, and historical context, as well as a profound hope, for the challenges affecting the American people.",1615411598,,Dissertations & Theses," Rosen, NylaRosenNylaRosen, Nyla",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3469338901 , 87709592 , 66569 , 9781321180633 , 3636434 , 3636434", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321180633, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1615411598?accountid=14496," 0304 Biographies , 0325 Black studies , 0449 Educational leadership , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0304 Biographies , 0325 Black studies , 0449 Educational leadership , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0304 Biographies , 0325 Black studies , 0449 Educational leadership , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0304 Biographies , 0325 Black studies , 0449 Educational leadership , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Biographies , Black studies , Educational leadership , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Education , Civil rights , Freedomways , King, martin luther , O'dell, jack , Rainbow coalition , Social justice",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=A+Study+of+Civil+Rights+Leader%2C+Labor+Organizer%2C+and+Educator+Jack+Hunter+O%27Dell+and+His+Contribution+to+the+Institute+for+Community+Leadership&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rosen%2C+Nyla&amp;isbn=9781321180633&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Brazilian Northeast, Inside Out: Region, Nation, and Globalization (1926-1968)","Each chapter of this dissertation presents a different event or moment of intense international interaction in which meanings of the Northeast and its place in the world are questioned and debated. It begins in 1926 with the Regionalist Conference of Recife, organized by Gilberto Freyre and ends with Martha Vasconcellos’ victory as Miss Universe in 1968, the same year in which the repressive Ato Institucional Número Cinco (Institutional Act Number Five) suspended many Constitutional rights (including the right to protest) and limited the ability to discuss the Northeast, its movements, its poverty, and its activism. Along the way, this dissertation examines an Orson Welles movie on a protest in the form of a two-month voyage by sailboat from Fortaleza to Rio de Janeiro, allegorical representations of the presence of U.S. military bases in the Northeast during World War II, the transformation of the Northeast into a region of “resistance” often represented by the bandit figure, a campaign to bring a World Cup event to Recife, and the representations of World Cup soccer in cordel literature, art, and popular music. Each of these chapters presents how Northeasterners from several walks of life discuss the many meanings of the Northeast in the nation and the world, emphasizing brief moments of consensus in which the Northeast was transformed from a meteorological designation into a place of rustic stocisim, from rustic stoicism to naiveté and abandon, and from abandon to resistance. In the end, while Gilberto Freyre’s foundational myth – that Brazil’s national culture derived from a mixing of European, African, and indigenous cultures – became the dominant narrative for national identity,3 although based on his interpretations of the Northeast, it did not survive as the dominant narrative of Northeastern identity. Instead, the terms of conversation on the region centered on the notions of drought, poverty, inferiority, and potential for rebellion. This analysis of international events in the Northeastern region demonstrates that regional identity in the Northeast is multivalent by nature and in a process of constant negotiation between state and intellectual invention and popular imagination, mediated by the region’s inhabitants and exiles. Identity, then, is better understood as a process than as a descriptive noun – a process of negotiation, mediation, contestation, and only brief moments of consensus. It is a multivalent process, cut through and patched back up with the reconciliations of class, gender, and race. It is not merely reflection and definition, but emphatically narration and creation. Nonetheless, while the meaning of the Northeast changed over time, reflecting concerns emanating from various social classes, and influenced by its international embeddedness, within its multiple meanings, the threads of inferiority, drought, poverty, and potential for rebellion stand out as dominant narratives.",1617520078,,Dissertations & Theses," Campbell, Courtney JeanetteCampbellJeanetteCourtneyCampbell, Courtney Jeanette",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3473370761 , 91303202 , 66569 , 9781321253313 , 3674116 , 3674116", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321253313, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1617520078?accountid=14496," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations"," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations",," 0312 Latin American literature , 0336 Latin American history , 0601 International Relations"," Latin American literature , Latin American history , International Relations"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Brazil , Brazilian northeast , Popular culture , Regional identity , Regionalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Brazilian+Northeast%2C+Inside+Out%3A+Region%2C+Nation%2C+and+Globalization+%281926-1968%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Campbell%2C+Courtney+Jeanette&amp;isbn=9781321253313&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Planning Development: International Experts, Agricultural Policy, and The Modernization of Nigeria, 1945-1967","The period after the Second World War was a significant moment in British colonialism in Nigeria. It was the height of the decolonization movements in many of Britain's colonial holdings and was the cradle of what David Low and J. M. Lonsdale call the ""second colonial occupation."" This occupation in which the British government carried out expansive development policies was an intentional attempt to wrestle with social unrest due to the neglect of the social welfare of the people during the Great Depression and in the period thereafter. Such a development vision was represented by the passage of the 1940 Colonial Development and Welfare Act. Unfortunately, the implementation of this act was interrupted by the war. After the war, this act was updated and passed in 1945. With a fund of £120 million earmarked for development in the colonies, this represented the single greatest financial investment by the British government in the colonies. Each of the colonies were asked to produce ten-year development plans. The plan that was produced by Nigeria depicts an important starting point in development planning and it reflected an agrarian bias. Several other plans have been produced since the 1945 plan. My study focuses on the 1945 plan and the 1962 plan which was the first post-independence national plan. This study particularly looks at the process that resulted in the plan documents. This is important because it helps to reveal the factors that led to the success or failure of development plans. The planning process shows us that outcomes do not always reveal intentions and it is important not to use the outcomes to judge intentionality. This work argues that the failure of late colonial development in Nigeria was not as a result of bad intentions but because of the racial limitations inherent in the colonial state. Such limitations led to the exclusion of Africans in the development process and in the rejection of indigenously produced knowledge. A case study of the Niger Agricultural Project, Mokwa treated in the fourth chapter sheds light on the importance of local knowledge to the development process. This study also reveals that persons and institutions matter in the development process. These reflect the human side of development. This dissertation shows how the feuds and conflicts between the technical departments and the political wing of the colonial state affected the 1945 colonial plan. The 1962 plan suffered because of conflicts between the main architect of the plan, Wolfgang Stolper, and the World Bank advisor to the prime minister, Narayan Prasad. This work also shows that despite the rhetorical claims of modernization theorists such as Walt Rostow and his colleagues at CIS, in practice, modernization theorists continued colonial development policies. In Nigeria, the 1962 plan that was designed by US social scientists such as Stolper continued the agrarian bias that was emblematic of colonial development. The study concludes that both the colonial and early ""postcolonial"" plans were affected by five factors: development ideology, human resources, financial resources, International experts/indigenous knowledge, and corruption.",1617956758,,Dissertations & Theses," Utietiang, BekehUtietiangBekehUtietiang, Bekeh",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3474546571 , 91305072 , 66569 , 9781321205848 , 3637651 , 3637651", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321205848, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1617956758?accountid=14496," 0331 African history , 0473 Agriculture , 0585 Science history , 0630 Public policy"," 0331 African history , 0473 Agriculture , 0585 Science history , 0630 Public policy"," 0331 African history , 0473 Agriculture , 0585 Science history , 0630 Public policy",," 0331 African history , 0473 Agriculture , 0585 Science history , 0630 Public policy"," African history , Agriculture , Science history , Public policy"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Agricultural policy , Cold war , Colonial britain , Nigeria , Nigeria development , United states international development policy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Planning+Development%3A+International+Experts%2C+Agricultural+Policy%2C+and+The+Modernization+of+Nigeria%2C+1945-1967&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Utietiang%2C+Bekeh&amp;isbn=9781321205848&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Sex Worker Political Development in Costa Rica: from Informal Solidarities to Formal Organizing,"While many accounts of sex workers presume they lack agency, this project studies how people framed as powerless assert positions of power through social interactions, friendships, and organizing. I examine sex workers' politics and power from the perspective of a subset of female Costa Rican sex workers. I engage specifically with sex workers who organize, in order to theorize everyday experiences of politics, including solidarity building and acts of accommodation or resistance vis-à-vis state interventions, health policies, and the police. Central theoretical bases for the project include Michael Hanchard and James Scott on ""politics from below."" I also draw on the work of Michele Berger in order to advance Political Science literature and frameworks in regarding everyday and labor-related interactions, challenging and extending the field's understanding of the politics of work-related interactions. I position sex-work as a form of labor and analyze the role that informal interactions play in organizing. The project also engages a multi-disciplinary set of literatures, including key texts from feminist and gender studies as well as theoretical and empirical approaches to studies of race, ethnicity, discrimination, and social movements. I discuss the political valences of stigma against sex work by extending concepts of discrimination from African-American studies. This study examines micro and macro aspects of sex worker activism through resistance politics, empowerment strategies, and organizing. It also provides practical and theoretical insights on sex worker politics that can apply to other communities. The project's central questions are: 1) what kinds of political actions characterize sex workers' engagement in Costa Rica? and 2) how are informal and formal strategies used to organize sex workers? Unique among studies of sex work, I present a multi-level analysis of these perspectives in a Latin American context. As a case, Costa Rica highlights the diverse ways sex workers organize to resist the status quo. The dissertation examines three distinct but interconnected contexts: individual sex workers working in San José's zona roja (red zone); female sex workers who organize with the twenty-year-old sex worker project La Sala ( The Living Room ); and the international network of Latin American sex worker organizations, RedTraSex.",1617960223,,Dissertations & Theses," Kone, Mzilikaz AshakiKoneAshakiMzilikazKone, Mzilikaz Ashaki",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3474590651 , 87866552 , 66569 , 9781321206586 , 3637686 , 3637686", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321206586, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1617960223?accountid=14496," 0451 Social psychology , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0451 Social psychology , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," 0451 Social psychology , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science",," 0451 Social psychology , 0453 Womens studies , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0615 Political science"," Social psychology , Womens studies , Latin American Studies , Political science"," Social sciences , Psychology , Empowerment , Human rights , Organizing , Politics , Sex workers , Transnational organizing",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sex+Worker+Political+Development+in+Costa+Rica%3A+from+Informal+Solidarities+to+Formal+Organizing&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kone%2C+Mzilikaz+Ashaki&amp;isbn=9781321206586&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Non-citizen citizenship: A comparative ethnography of undocumented activism in Chicago and Brussels,"Over the past few decades, undocumented immigrants have established a tangible presence in North America and Europe. Regardless of the social, cultural, and economic contributions they make to their societies of residence, they remain unrecognized. As non-citizens, they are largely excluded from the rights and privileges associated with citizenship. Despite this non-recognition, undocumented immigrants have increasingly ""come out of the shadows"" in recent years to claim their rights. Scholarship on migration and citizenship is unable to fully grasp the meaning of undocumented activism because it fails to acknowledge the importance of legal status on the one hand and privileges institutional adaptation as a driver of citizenship transformation on the other hand. This study investigates the transformation of citizenship in times of global migration from the perspective of the non-citizen, the liminal subject located betwixt and between statuses. I introduce a theoretical understanding of ""non-citizen citizenship"" that assigns a central place to the political practices whereby non-citizens make claims to belonging, inclusion, and recognition. Accordingly, I adopt a hermeneutic approach to study the processes of strategic (dis)-identification through which undocumented immigrants become rights-claiming subjects. Based on comparative ethnographic research in civic organizations in Chicago and Brussels, this research demonstrates how undocumented activists make claims to recognition in their societies of residence. I argue that schools and churches respectively operate as ""safe spaces"" for undocumented immigrants' self-organization and representation. I then outline how undocumented youth embraced the power of storytelling as a political tool in Chicago. I contend that storytelling is employed as a community-building, mobilizing, and claims-making social movement practice. In Brussels, I describe how, in the absence of political openings, gaining public visibility became the sans-papiers' primary objective. I argue that the sans-papiers politicized their bodies through hunger strikes, occupations, and marches so as to claim specific rights. On a broader level, this transatlantic comparative case study shows that regardless of the circumstances, undocumented activists contest prevailing dichotomies of citizen/non-citizen and legal/illegal by creatively (re)-inventing ways of being political. While non-citizen citizenship differs depending on the political context, it nevertheless points towards a reconfiguration of citizenship in the twenty-first century.",1619356946,,Dissertations & Theses," Swerts, ThomasSwertsThomasSwerts, Thomas",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3480272931 , 91473082 , 66569 , 9781321225235 , 3638699 , 3638699", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321225235, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1619356946?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Social structure , Organizational behavior"," Social sciences , Citizenship , Civic organizations , Ethnography , Irregular migration , Political sociology , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Non-citizen+citizenship%3A+A+comparative+ethnography+of+undocumented+activism+in+Chicago+and+Brussels&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Swerts%2C+Thomas&amp;isbn=9781321225235&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Fixin' to tell: Cultural preservation, multiculturalism, and a delicate double commitment in Appalshop's ""insider"" activism","From global non-profits to local community centers, many groups working with and from within mis- and under-represented populations have embraced documentary media in activist work as a tool for undermining stereotypes and engendering positive identity formation. Despite steady increases in community-based documentary work, such programs remain relatively underscrutinized, with the majority of scholarship praising the liberatory potentials of documentary self-representation. Further, of the many programs implementing community-based documentary work as a tool for social change, I found very few based in rural regions of the Southern U.S. Likewise, in scholarly discourse associated with such programs, the South, in general, remains an understudied region. The one exception to this rule is Appalshop, a community media organization based in Whitesburg, Kentucky. While Appalshop is widely celebrated for its documentary activist work, this thesis is primarily concerned with Appalshop's organizational self-representation and how particular assumptions therein may inform, and problematize, their contemporary activist goals. I examine Appalshop's organizational identity, especially as it manifests in concepts of tradition and cultural authenticity, in the utilization of positive stereotypes, and in an asserted commitment to the ""value of diversity."" I consider how Appalshop's particular approach to place-based identity may perpetuate a process of cultural exclusion that is rooted in early strategies to define and ""fix"" southern Appalachia. In the following chapters, I first provide an overview of the particular social and political ideologies undergirding common perceptions of Appalachian culture, beginning with particular attention to outside influences and then briefly introducing an internal movement in opposition that emerged in the early 1970s, at which point Appalshop becomes my central focus. The next two chapters comprise a two-part critique of Appalshop: First, exploring a perceived commitment to authentic Appalachian culture central to their work, and, second, considering how this commitment to authenticity undermines their organization's contemporary commitment to the ""value of diversity."" In conclusion, I consult scholarship on cultural heritage tourism and poststructuralist feminist discourse on education and identity in order to begin to imagine alternatives approaches to doing implementing community-based documentary education programming in rural Southern contexts. This work is an exploration into the potential of community-based documentary work to engender radical thought and action, with the hope that it might contribute to a larger project: a framework for self-sustaining documentary education programs, specifically suited to rural communities in the South.",1620743719,,Dissertations & Theses," Hudson, Kathleen S.HudsonS.KathleenHudson, Kathleen S.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3483968511 , 91555952 , 66569 , 9781321238099 , 1566329 , 1566329", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321238099, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1620743719?accountid=14496," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0604 Regional Studies"," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0604 Regional Studies"," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0604 Regional Studies",," 0455 Multicultural Education , 0604 Regional Studies"," Multicultural Education , Regional Studies"," Social sciences , Education",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fixin%27+to+tell%3A+Cultural+preservation%2C+multiculturalism%2C+and+a+delicate+double+commitment+in+Appalshop%27s+%22insider%22+activism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hudson%2C+Kathleen+S.&amp;isbn=9781321238099&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The &lt;i&gt;Dekassegui&lt;/i&gt; movement: Identity transformation of Japanese Brazilian &lt;i&gt;Dekassegui&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Arubaito&lt;/i&gt; young adults to Japan and upon return to Brazil,"International migration between Japan and Brazil dated back to 1908, when initial Japanese migrants arrived in Brazil. Nearly twenty-five years later after Brazil's crippling economic crisis in the 1980s coincided with a boom in the Japanese economy, a reverse flow occurred, as thousands of Brazilians of Japanese descent traveled to Japan to work in manufacturing and construction factories. Within this migratory flow, also known as the Dekassegui movement, exist a group of university students, or Arubaitos, who chose to work in Japanese auto, electronic, and food sectors during their three to four month summer break. The 2008 financial crisis not only destabilized Japan's economy, but it also created much uncertainty for foreign migrant workers, including the Japanese Brazilians. The global economic crisis served as a background context to this study to determine how migration transformed individual lives and group membership and how ethnicity and identity boundaries shifted and were reconstructed under distinct social, economic, and political contexts. This research seeks to contribute to the ongoing discussion in migration, ethnic identity, intercultural adaptation, and student mobility literature by understanding how the (ethnic) return migration to Japan and repatriation to Brazil not only shaped third generation Japanese Brazilian young adults' adaptation experiences, but also highlighted the importance of the intersections of ethnicity, culture, and identity. This dissertation employed a qualitative and multi-site ethnographic case study approach using a mixed method data collection of surveys, semi-structured interviews, and archival documents. Findings illustrated that through short-term migration to Japan, the Japanese Brazilians engendered a resistance identity towards the host country and realized a more pronounced Brazilian identity. I contend that key factors such as age, motivations, expectations, and length of stay shape both the Arubaitos and Dekasseguis' migration decision making and re-adaption process into Brazil. The return flow back to their home country of Brazil revealed the complex and fluid process of identity formation and allowed both the Arubaitos and Dekasseguis to obtain a sense of ethnic identity achievement through a clearer, nuanced, and fuller understanding of their transcultural Japanese and Brazilian identities.",1622417309,,Dissertations & Theses," Sasaki, Lindsey Y.SasakiY.LindseySasaki, Lindsey Y.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3491523491 , 91669932 , 66569 , 9781321303131 , 3643040 , 3643040", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321303131, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1622417309?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Latin American Studies , International Relations , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Ethnic identity , International migration , International student mobility , Japanese brazilian , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Dekassegui+movement%3A+Identity+transformation%0Aof+Japanese+Brazilian+Dekassegui+and+Arubaito%0Ayoung+adults+to+Japan+and+upon+return+to+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sasaki%2C+Lindsey+Y.&amp;isbn=9781321303131&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""The Greek Fire"": The Greek War for Independence and the Emergence of American Reform Movements, 1780-1860","This dissertation places early Americans in the midst of a global conflict that pit the Greeks against the Ottoman Turks. Although historians have focused a great deal of attention on American support for the French Revolution, few have examined a similar conflict, the Greek War for Independence. Fought from 1821 to 1832, this war generated nearly as much popular support and interest as had the French movement. Perceiving strong cultural and intellectual ties with Greece, American men and women identified the region as the seedbed of American democracy and a crucial source of American values. Contrasting their western classical tradition with the Muslim origins of the Ottoman Empire, Americans portrayed the struggle in Greece as a climactic battle between western freedom and Oriental despotism. The sentimental bond with ancient Greece, along with contemporary distrust of the Ottoman Empire, produced an outpouring of popular enthusiasm. Joining in a transatlantic alliance that linked Britain and the United States, American authors produced numerous poems, plays, and political tracts to generate support for the Greek cause. At the same time, American men and women throughout the country organized at the grassroots level to send men, money, and supplies to aid the Greeks. Pressure was placed on Congress to intervene on the Greeks' behalf. These efforts, however, encountered serious resistance from U.S. officials who wished to maintain official neutrality and cultivate commercial ties with the Ottomans. After the Greek War ended, American interest in Greek independence continued to exert an influence on American society and politics. Lurid portrayals of Ottoman slavery and their mistreatment of women had inadvertently highlighted American failures with regard to slavery and the status of women. Many men and women who had organized in support of Greek independence transitioned into supporting other forms of social and political reform. More than a transient political movement, support for the Greek War had created a practical school for politics that facilitated the emergence of abolitionist and women's rights movements in antebellum America.",1625052290,,Dissertations & Theses," Santelli, Maureen ConnorsSantelliConnorsMaureenSantelli, Maureen Connors",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3495778061 , 89828242 , 66569 , 9781321331851 , 3644804 , 3644804", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321331851, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1625052290?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0506 World History"," 0337 American history , 0506 World History"," 0337 American history , 0506 World History",," 0337 American history , 0506 World History"," American history , World History"," Social sciences , Abolitionism , American foreign relations , American reform movements , Ancient world , Greek revolution , Women's rights",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22The+Greek+Fire%22%3A+The+Greek+War+for+Independence+and+the+Emergence+of+American+Reform+Movements%2C+1780-1860&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Santelli%2C+Maureen+Connors&amp;isbn=9781321331851&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Writing from the Periphery: W. G. Sebald and Outsider Art,"This study focuses on a major aspect of literature and culture in the later twentieth century: the intersection of psychiatry, madness and art. As the antipsychiatry movement became an international intervention, W. G. Sebald's fascination with psychopathology rapidly developed. While Sebald collected many materials on Outsider Artists and has several annotated books on psychiatry in his personal library, I examine how Sebald's thought and writings, both academic and literary, were particularly influenced by Ernst Herbeck's poems. Herbeck, a diagnosed schizophrenic, spent decades under the care of Dr. Leo Navratil at the psychiatric institute in Maria Gugging. Sebald became familiar with Herbeck via the book, Schizophrenie und Sprache (1966), in which Navratil analyzed his patients' creative writings in order to illustrate commonalities between pathological artistic productions and canonical German literature, thereby blurring the lines between genius and madness. In 1980, Sebald travelled to Vienna to meet Ernst Herbeck and this experience inspired him to compose two academic essays on Herbeck and the semi-fictionalized account of their encounter in his novel Vertigo (1990). In this study, I reveal how Sebald incorporated Herbeck within his works over a thirty year period in order to provide a social commentary. Sebald looks to Herbeck to examine what had become the standards of normality in Western Germany following the Second World War from a critical perspective. Not only is Sebald's empathetic identification with the outsider Herbeck in itself a political and social act of protest, but I show how Sebald recognized in Herbeck's language an embodiment of his own viewpoints regarding (eco)politics and critical theory. Since his understanding of Herbeck is informed by a number of disciplines, various cultural discourses assist in my clarification: I turn to Sebald's interest in the Frankfurt School thinkers, such as Max Horkheimer and Theodor Adorno; Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari's ideas on minor literature; political viewpoints as posed by filmmakers such as Alexander Kluge and Werner Herzog; and also the socio-anthropological writings of Pierre Bertaux, Michel Foucault and Claude Lévi-Strauss. I furthermore provide close readings of Herbeck's poems to argue that Sebald imitates Herbeck's style. Focusing initially on archival material, I locate within Sebald's unpublished poetry and prose several thematic, linguistic and semantic characteristics which are typical of Herbeck's poetry. I then expand this analysis to incorporate how these features also reappear in Sebald's published novels. In uncovering underexplored intertextuality, this study sheds new light both on Sebald's novels, since recognizing Herbeck's voice within his prose calls for a reevaluation of what is ""Sebaldian"", as well as on the broader, yet underexplored cultural movement from which I focus on Herbeck as the apex. It also locates Sebald's key political ideas and his values concerning poetics and morality as derivatives of a particular historical and psychological discourse.",1625967881,,Dissertations & Theses," Etzler, Melissa StarrEtzlerStarrMelissaEtzler, Melissa Starr",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3500562581 , 91864432 , 66569 , 9781321258820 , 3640423 , 3640423", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321258820, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1625967881?accountid=14496," 0311 Germanic literature , 0435 Cinematography"," 0311 Germanic literature , 0435 Cinematography"," 0311 Germanic literature , 0435 Cinematography",," 0311 Germanic literature , 0435 Cinematography"," Germanic literature , Cinematography"," Language, literature and linguistics , Communication and the arts , Herbeck, ernst , Psychopathology , Sebald, w. g.",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Writing+from+the+Periphery%3A+W.+G.+Sebald+and+Outsider+Art&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Etzler%2C+Melissa+Starr&amp;isbn=9781321258820&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Rights to the city and spatial justice: The search for social justice in post-1970 Long Beach,"A historical narrative of Long Beach in the rights to the city and spatial justice literature has remained untold within the broader California narrative. This analysis looks at the case of Long Beach and focuses on two critical junctures in its development. The concept of the right to the city centers on social justice for anyone dispossessed by the conditions of urban life which can be achieved by creating more space for democratic participation and inclusivity over the production of the city for all social groups. Related to rights to the city, spatial justice theory posits that the current system of urban restructuring and development reproduce injustices through factors such as uneven development, disinvestment, and marginalization and only by transforming these processes can we achieve social justice. Rights to the city and spatial justice both underscore challenging existing power relations that drive the production of urban space. While the focus of this research is limited to Long Beach, the implications are much broader; the concepts ofthe rights to the city and spatial justice are about understanding and transforming global processes by starting transformation at the local level. The case study of Long Beach can add to both the literature and the right to the city and spatial justice movements by demonstrating ways Long Beach community members have attempted to achieve the right to the city and transform it to a more spatially just urban area. The findings generated from the analysis of two prominent Long Beach social movement organizations, The Long Beach Area Citizens Involved (LBACI) and The Long Beach Coalition for Good Jobs and a Healthy Community (the Coalition), suggest that community members have successfully challenged the processes underlying the development of Long Beach in the pursuit of social justice.",1626712141,,Dissertations & Theses," Madden, Lauren A.MaddenA.LaurenMadden, Lauren A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3503252651 , 91918362 , 66569 , 9781321277272 , 1526927 , 1526927", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321277272, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1626712141?accountid=14496," 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning",," 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," Public policy , Urban planning"," Social sciences , California , Long Beach history , Right to the city , Social movements , Spatial justice , Urban studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rights+to+the+city+and+spatial+justice%3A+The+search+for+social+justice+in+post-1970+Long+Beach&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Madden%2C+Lauren+A.&amp;isbn=9781321277272&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"All the ships that never sailed: A general model of illicit market suppression,"This model predicts progress in transnational illicit market suppression campaigns by comparing the relative efficiency and support of the suppression regime vis-à-vis the targeted illicit market. Focusing on competitive adaptive processes, this 'Boxer' model theorizes that these campaigns proceed cyclically, with the illicit market expressing itself through a clandestine business model, and the suppression regime attempting to identify and disrupt this model. Success in disruption causes the illicit network to 'reboot' and repeat the cycle. If the suppression network is quick enough to continually impose these 'rebooting' costs on the illicit network, and robust enough to endure long enough to reshape the path dependencies that underwrite the illicit market, it will prevail. Two scripts put this model into practice. The organizational script uses two variables, efficiency and support, to predict organizational evolution in response to competitive pressures. The suppression network should become 'flat' and 'market-like,' in order to rapidly adapt, and it should maintain a deeply embedded social movement backing the campaign. Success allows for progress through the operational script, which predicts changes in the illicit market using economic theory. Initially, the illicit market uses public 'focal points' to conduct business. If the suppressor succeeds in injecting unacceptable risk in these focal points through patrolling, the illicit market is forced to take a firm-like 'black market' form. The suppressor shifts to interdiction in response, and if successful again, they subsidize alternate demand path dependencies. Suppression ends either by the suppressor abandoning the attempt or through a path dependency swap to a benign substitute. I test these theories using historical cases—the British suppression of the Atlantic Slave Trade and the USCG's 'Rum War' during Prohibition. Using a multi-method approach inspired by operations research, I use process tracing, statistical analysis, primary historical research, and social network analysis to evaluate changes in relative efficiency and support over time. I then apply the model to contemporary cases—piracy, human trafficking, money laundering, and drug trafficking—for sensitivity and robustness checks. A large-n analysis provides further scoping. Finally, I apply the model to the policy problem of cyberspace-facilitated modern-day slavery.",1629481097,,Dissertations & Theses," Blair, David JosephBlairJosephDavidBlair, David Joseph",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3513722311 , 87743102 , 66569 , 9781321283907 , 3641877 , 3641877", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321283907, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1629481097?accountid=14496," 0501 Economics , 0601 International Relations , 0627 Criminology"," 0501 Economics , 0601 International Relations , 0627 Criminology"," 0501 Economics , 0601 International Relations , 0627 Criminology",," 0501 Economics , 0601 International Relations , 0627 Criminology"," Economics , International Relations , Criminology"," Social sciences , Complexity , Crime , Networks , Prohibition , Slave trade , Trafficking",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=All+the+ships+that+never+sailed%3A+A+general+model+of+illicit+market+suppression&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blair%2C+David+Joseph&amp;isbn=9781321283907&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Contentious Cosmopolitans: Black Public History and Civil Rights in Cold War Chicago, 1942-1972","This dissertation looks at how teachers, unionists, and cultural workers used black history to offer new ways of thinking about racial knowledge from a local level. Numerous efforts to promote and teach this history demonstrated how dissident cosmopolitan political currents from previous decades remained relevant to a vibrant and ideologically diffuse African American public sphere despite widespread Cold War dispersions, white supremacist reactions, and anticommunist repressions. My argument proceeds by demonstrating how these public history projects coalesced around a series of connected pedagogical endeavors. These endeavors included the work of school teachers on Chicago's South side who tried to advance curriculum reforms through World War II and afterwards, the work of packinghouse workers and other union-focused educators who used anti-discrimination campaigns to teach about the history of African Americans and Mexican Americans in the labor movement and to advance innovative models for worker education, and the activities of important cultural workers like Margaret and Charles Burroughs who politicized urban space and fought for greater recognition of black history in the public sphere through the advancement of their vision for a museum. Collectively, these projects expressed important ideas about race, citizenship, education and intellectual labors that engaged closely with the rapidly shifting terrains of mid-20th Century civil rights and international anti-colonialisms. Ultimately, this dissertation offers a social history about how cosmopolitan cultural work in public history and similar forms of knowledge production were at the intersections of political realities and lived experience in U.S. urban life.",1634881183,,Dissertations & Theses," Rocksborough-Smith, Ian MaxwellRocksborough-SmithMaxwellIanRocksborough-Smith, Ian Maxwell",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3521594051 , 92319412 , 66569 , 9781321397406 , 3666649 , 3666649", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321397406, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1634881183?accountid=14496," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history",," 0328 Black history , 0337 American history"," Black history , American history"," Social sciences , African american studies , Black history , Chicago , Civil rights , Cold war , Cosmopolitanism , Cultural workers , Mid-20th century , Midwest , Politics , Public history , Race , Southside , U.s. communism , United states , Urban",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Contentious+Cosmopolitans%3A+Black+Public+History+and+Civil+Rights+in+Cold+War+Chicago%2C%0A1942-1972&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rocksborough-Smith%2C+Ian+Maxwell&amp;isbn=9781321397406&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Building bridges across cultures: A case study of the people-to-people campaign, 1956-1975","This study traces origins, operation, successes and failures of the People-to-People program featured during the second term of the Eisenhower presidency. The program was a product of and a reaction to the Cold War international conflicts that emanated from diametrically opposed ideologies of democracies and the communist world. U.S. claims to the superiority of democracy over communism were rooted in immediate post-war America's quest for world leadership. The People-to-People campaign was a government-backed popular movement, which spread in the 1950s and expanded into the 1960s. It was partially coordinated and partially funded by the United States Information Agency during its first few years, with the expectation that it would attract private as well as grassroots support once it was launched. This dissertation explores People-to-People's various programs and projects including the Sister-Cities and the University chapter as models for secular voluntary movements of ordinary citizens who were committed to improving mutual understanding between peoples from different cultures. The idealistic nature of people-to-people diplomacy, along with a wide variety of personal and social stakes associated with international travel and relations, made the People-to-People University program one of the most popular student organizations on college campuses in the 1960s. People-to-People's popularity and ideals at that time attracted young Americans and provided them with both the opportunity and the enthusiasm to interact with foreign peoples at the grassroots level. It also gave them a sense of belonging to a broader, constructive human network, which promoted an appreciation of diverse cultures and a way to contribute to building the ""bonds of solidarity"" among people of many nations during the contested period of the Cold War.",1637644151,,Dissertations & Theses," Serj, BattsetsegSerjBattsetsegSerj, Battsetseg",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3530610371 , 90130422 , 66569 , 9781321373530 , 3665050 , 3665050", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321373530, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1637644151?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0323 American studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0323 American studies , 0582 Modern history",," 0323 American studies , 0582 Modern history"," American studies , Modern history"," Social sciences , Cold War international conflicts , Eisenhower presidency , People-to-people program , Successes and failures",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+bridges+across+cultures%3A+A+case+study+of+the+people-to-people+campaign%2C+1956-1975&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Serj%2C+Battsetseg&amp;isbn=9781321373530&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Postmodern Warfare, In Images: Esthetics and Conflict Photography in Nicaragua 1978-1989","My dissertation examines the photographic representation of war at the turn of the nineteen-eighties, taking up as a case study the Sandinista Revolution and the Contra War in Nicaragua (1978-1989). By applying art historical methods to the analysis of documentary photography and photojournalism, I seek to unravel the production of esthetic structures in contentious political climates, exploring the meanings of images as socio-cultural entities and their relation to memory. Nicaragua presents a compelling context for analysis, as documentary materials - including photographs, photo-books, films and various forms of non-fiction writing - were instrumental in forwarding both pro-war and anti-war agendas, motivating violent and non-violent strategies of resistance in turn. Located at the intersection of social upheaval and civil unrest, revolutionary idealism and nation-building processes, militancy, activism and human rights, these photographic objects speak to a transitional period during the late seventies and eighties, when important debates around documentary practices accompanied the emergence of critical theory and postmodern discourse in Latin America and in the United States. Throughout the Cold War, and more actively during the nineteen-eighties, a transnational network of Latin American, North American, and European photographers followed the development of revolutionary movements and civil wars in Central America. An extensive visual record ensued, documenting decades of instability, and some of the deadliest and most violent global conflicts from the second half of the past century. Unbound by territory, preserved in various repositories throughout the world, this inter-textual ""imaginary archive"" of documentary photography has rarely been analyzed in relation to broader contemporary esthetic practices.

It argues that, drawing from this intellectual tradition, writers on the interwar left in Yugoslavia used literature to reimagine the space of South East Europe and negotiate broader concerns with international revolution, local self-determination and cultural development, posed by the rapid integration of this region into global political and economic structures. The first chapter (1870-1914) traces the reception of the communist idea to the Balkans in the late nineteenth century, arguing that theorists such as Svetozar Markovic and Dimitrije Tucovic developed the vision of a Balkan Socialist Federation to articulate anti-colonial demands for regional self-determination. The chapter argues that this idea of a Balkan Federation shaped the local reception of the communist idea, drawing from its intellectual reservoirs new visions of community that rejected the homogenizing tendencies of nationalism and re-imagined the geographies of Europe and the Balkans. The second chapter (1918-1926) follows the fate of Balkan Federalism among the post-war radical avant-gardes, exploring their efforts at re-envisioning the space of their region in line with revolutionary communist and radical aesthetic practices. Chapter three (1928-1934) recounts the emergence of the Yugoslav social literature movement during the 6 January Dictatorship and argues that the movement's linguistic politics and strategies of cultural development undermined ideas of Balkan community. The idea of a distinctly Balkan space, however, was kept alive by certain intellectuals on the literary left of Yugoslavia and chapter four offers a close study of the work of the Croatian modernist Miroslav Krleza and his attempt to reimagine the space of south east Europe through the framework of the communist idea. It undertakes a close reading of Krleza's first novel, The return of Philip Latinowicz, to show how the author's construction of the imagined space of 'Pannonia' and his use of an abject aesthetics operated according to a political-economic logic of community at odds with that of nationalism. Chapter five (1934-1938) continues to trace the erosion of ideas of Balkan community among the Yugoslav literary left. It concerns the rise of fascism and the formation of the popular front, and argues that during this period leftist writers in Yugoslavia undertook a rapprochement with Europe, reimagining their own region as part of a wider European space. As writers sought to adapt the communist idea to the new strategic priorities of the popular front, leftist intellectuals sought to appropriate popular and national histories to use against rising fascist movements. In initiating this leftist appropriation of the past, they cast themselves as defenders and successors of a distinctly European history of progress, enlightenment and democracy. The dissertation makes three broader contributions to the literature in the field of European history. First, it challenges existing scholarly assumptions regarding the hegemony of nationalism, and instead points to different forms of imagined communities grounded in alternative logics of belonging. Second, by showing how writers on Europe's periphery engaged with the fraught question of belonging to or escaping from a wider European space it seeks to decenter Europe as the sole political and cultural horizon for the Balkans. Finally, it offers an intellectual history of communism in Eastern Europe that suspends the teleological focus on the post-war socialist regimes and instead addresses the multiplicity of visions, aspirations and perspectives contained within communist thought during the interwar period.",1637646153,,Dissertations & Theses," Robertson, JamesRobertsonJamesRobertson, James",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3530631191 , 87092852 , 66569 , 9781321375039 , 3665200 , 3665200", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321375039, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1637646153?accountid=14496," 0314 Slavic literature , 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies"," 0314 Slavic literature , 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies"," 0314 Slavic literature , 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies",," 0314 Slavic literature , 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies"," Slavic literature , European history , East European Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Balkans , Communism , Community , Intellectual history , Literary left , Yugoslavia",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Balkan+worlds%3A+Community%2C+space+and+revolutionary+internationalism+on+the+Yugoslav+literary+left%2C+1870-1938&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Robertson%2C+James&amp;isbn=9781321375039&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Tango, Not-For-Export: Participatory Music-Making, Musical Activism, and Visual Ethnomusicology in the Neighborhood Tango Scenes of Buenos Aires","This dissertation examines how local neighborhood tango music movements–reacting to ""for-export"" tango and the neoliberal cultural trends of Argentina in the 1990s–have reclaimed and reterritorialized tango as a form of local musical social life and as an approach to musical activism in Buenos Aires over the past 15 years. To most non-Argentines, tango is thought of as a passionate and sensual form of dance. However, tango as a musical culture also has a rich history in the city of Buenos Aires, and not one that is always associated with dancing. Scholars in the late 1990s studied the processes through which tango was deterritorialized, exoticized and transformed into a transnational ""for-export"" dance phenomenon. More recent works have discussed the ways that, following the 2001 Argentine economic crisis, the government used ""for-export"" tango as an economic and cultural resource to promote tourism. Moving away from government agendas, my research explores how, parallel to these other phenomena, musicians have been revitalizing tango music as a form of everyday socialization and everyday urban activism in the contemporary neighborhoods of Buenos Aires. Through a musical ethnography of the Almagro neighborhood, home to the city's most thriving not ""for-export"" tango music scene, I explore how the advent of informal and participatory live musics scenes in small bars in the late `90s allowed for the production of local spaces for musical transmission, urban intimacy, community building, and musical activism for a new generation of tango musicians. Beyond contributing to literature on tango as a contemporary musical form of urban culture in neoliberalizing Buenos Aires, I examine how feelings of locality in contemporary tango scenes are often produced at the complex intersection of sentimentality and post-neoliberal forms of urban activism. In particular, I examine I analyze the neighborhood location of these scenes not only as a physical space where alternative tango cultures developed, but also as a powerful symbolic imaginary where new musical and social practices continue to be constructed on top of powerful historic social imaginaries of the neighborhood. Because globalized pop music genres like tango are so entrenched in powerful visual and sonic stereotypes, I utilize filmmaking throughout my dissertation as a sensorial mode through which to construct new visual and sensory ways of knowing tango culture. Inspired by theories of observational cinema, visual anthropology, and sensory ethnography, I propose sensory filmmaking as a rich methodological approach to studying the complex social dynamics and sensory aesthetics so integral to the production of meaningful local tango cultures today.",1637659378,,Dissertations & Theses," Gubner, Jennie MerisGubnerMerisJennieGubner, Jennie Meris",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3530734961 , 84988902 , 66569 , 9781321381269 , 3665531 , 3665531", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321381269, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1637659378?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies , 0900 Film studies"," Music , Latin American Studies , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Buenos aires , Ethnographic film , Neoliberal resistance , Sensory ethnography , Urban activism , Visual ethnomusicology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tango%2C+Not-For-Export%3A+Participatory+Music-Making%2C+Musical+Activism%2C+and+Visual+Ethnomusicology+in+the+Neighborhood+Tango+Scenes+of+Buenos+Aires&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gubner%2C+Jennie+Meris&amp;isbn=9781321381269&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Luis Chávez y González, Archbishop of San Salvador 1938-1977: His Life and Work","In considering the history of the Roman Catholic Church in El Salvador during the 20th century, many people have focused on the civil war and the religious persecution of the 1980s—notably, the murder of priests, religious, catechists, lay people, and the Archbishop of San Salvador, Oscar Romero. Treatments of this volatile period have usually emphasized the implementation of the Second Vatican Council (1962-1965) and the Medellín conference (1968) through liturgical reforms, popular movements and comunidades eclesiales de base. In most accounts of modern Salvadoran history, little more than passing mention is given to Luis Chávez y González, Archbishop of San Salvador (1938-1977), who attended both Vatican II and Medellin. Nonetheless, it was Chávez y González, who played the pivotal role in implementing the teaching of both the Council and the Conference in El Salvador. Even prior to the Council and the Conference, Chávez y González began implementing a series of reforms in clerical formation, parroquial organization and social involvement by the Church. The nearly four decades of his archepiscopal leadership were both the preparation and the antecedents for the notable changes that subsequently occurred in the Salvadoran Church. From the beginning of his episcopate, Chávez y González was concerned with the formation of the clergy, the establishment of a Catholic University, the sponsoring of catechetical seminars and pastoral workshops, the training of the laity, and the creation of workers' cooperatives and financial institutions for the benefit ordinary people. In addition, he was involved in the founding of primary schools and literacy programs, as well as the establishment of professional and academic associations. The fifty-four pastoral letters of Chávez y González not only addressed such ecclesial themes as the Christian life and popular piety, but also social issues such as the condition of the working class, the rights and duties of employers and employees, inflation and economic development, and especially the mission of the laity in transforming the world. He also introduced pastoral initiatives, such as Catholic Action (1939) and the Archdiocesan Social Apostolate (1962) and sponsored three model Comunidades Eclesiales de Base in Suchitoto, Aguilares y Zacamil. This dissertation investigated the life and work of Chávez y González, which have previously not been studied in detail. Relying on archival materials and oral interviews, in addition to numerous publications, this dissertation presents an historical interpretation of the changes that occurred in the structure of the Salvadoran Church during his episcopate—particularly the transition from a traditional to a more progressive Catholicism. His ecclesial vision and his pastoral activity were often intertwined with national and international events. Special attention is paid to his concern about: social problems, such as the poverty and the education of the Salvadoran people; the formation of the clergy both prior to and following Vatican II; parish activities and the role of the laity; the relationship of Church and society. In sum, this dissertation provides an extended historical account of the life and work of Luis Chávez y González and his lasting impact on the Roman Catholic Church in El Salvador.",1638204451,,Dissertations & Theses," Martinez-Diaz, Paz AlexanderMartinez-DiazAlexanderPazMartinez-Diaz, Paz Alexander",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3531648891 , 90131952 , 66569 , 9781321337655 , 3645135 , 3645135", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321337655, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1638204451?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0336 Latin American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0336 Latin American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0336 Latin American history",," 0320 Religious history , 0336 Latin American history"," Religious history , Latin American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Chavez y gonzalez, luis , Church in latin america , Iglesia salvadorena",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Luis+Ch%C3%A1vez+y+Gonz%C3%A1lez%2C+Archbishop+of+San+Salvador%0A1938-1977%3A+His+Life+and+Work&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Martinez-Diaz%2C+Paz+Alexander&amp;isbn=9781321337655&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Making of a Crisis in Mexico: An Inductive Analysis of Media Sentiment and Information Cascades on the Value of the Mexican Peso during the 2008 Global Financial Crisis,"In the two decades prior to the 2008 financial crisis, the Mexican government pursued policies aimed at liberalizing markets, while simultaneously trying to ensure the stability of the peso. These policies consisted of monetary and fiscal controls to keep inflation low and free trade agreements to reduce Mexico's dependence on the United States. The policies significantly reduced the country's public deficit and were implemented in hopes that they would help reduce the country's exposure to currency crises. Yet, despite all provisions the Mexican government put in place, the country's peso still lost two percent of its value in the first three days following the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, the US-based investment firm. The loss was significant given the average appreciation of the peso in the months leading up to the crisis was one percent per month, and given that not enough time had passed to fully understand the impact that bankruptcy would have had on Mexico. By the following Monday, the peso recovered all of its lost value, suggesting that investors were uncertain about the true impact the events unfolding in the United States would have on Mexico's economy. It also suggested that the uncertainty and negative sentiment within the market during the initial week of the global crisis played a stronger role in the rapid depreciation and recovery of the peso than changes in market fundamentals. Using an inductive analysis of the historical events, this thesis suggests the circumstances in which sentiment engendered by mainstream media and distributed through digital channels during the financial crisis could have contributed to the dramatic short-term swings in the price of the peso. Specifically, this paper focuses on the new, digital information technologies, their use among investors as a means for financial research, and the role of high-frequency trading (HFT) algorithms in initiating information cascades. HFT algorithms account for nearly 70 percent of daily trading volume in financial markets and can magnify negative market sentiment among rational investors. Utilizing historical trading data for the peso and headlines and tweets published by the Thomson Reuters news group during the crisis, I seek to illustrate the correlations between market sentiment manifest in digital media and the price movements of the peso, indicating possible herd behavior tendencies in the form of information cascades. Though it is not possible to empirically separate the market movements of informed decision-makers from the information cascades of investors and HFT algorithms reacting to media, the fact that information cascades can and do exist as demonstrated by specific examples in this paper has significant implications for the Mexican peso. The existence of information cascades implies that having strong macroeconomic fundamentals is no longer an adequate safe guard against the immediate impacts of external crises. As social media becomes the main source of breaking news and market sentiment for mainstream media and investors, it becomes vital for emerging countries such as Mexico to monitor social platforms for sentiment related to the domestic economy in order to proactively address investor pessimism. Finally, emerging country governments can utilize these platforms to push out relevant and truthful information about the economy in order to diminish investor uncertainty and minimize the impact of externally-induced information cascades.",1639056923,,Dissertations & Theses," Vachalek, Lisa M.VachalekM.LisaVachalek, Lisa M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3533920921 , 92516372 , 66569 , 9781321359688 , 1569692 , 1569692", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321359688, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1639056923?accountid=14496, 0550 Latin American Studies, 0550 Latin American Studies, 0550 Latin American Studies,, 0550 Latin American Studies, Latin American Studies," Social sciences , 2008 global financial crisis , Digital information technology , Media sentiment , Mexican peso , Mexico , Social media",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Making+of+a+Crisis+in+Mexico%3A+An+Inductive+Analysis+of+Media+Sentiment+and+Information+Cascades+on+the+Value+of+the+Mexican+Peso+during+the+2008+Global+Financial+Crisis&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vachalek%2C+Lisa+M.&amp;isbn=9781321359688&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The complexities of praxis: Freirean-based popular education, unstable places, and implementing policy at a Zapatista elementary school in Chiapas, México","In advocating for social justice, social movement organizations (SMO) have turned to education in culturally and institutionally relevant settings, either supplementing, reforming, or replacing state-administered schooling. These efforts have acted as an educational process to meet academic standards, create awareness of systemic inequities, and cultivate communal leadership. Popular education associated with Brazilian educator Paulo Freire has been at the forefront of such schooling trends, and utilizes a specific pedagogy and curriculum in serving these ends. Students learn multiple literacies (e.g., textual and contextual) and what Freire refers to as ""reading the word and the world"". In México, the Zapatistas have formed a network of Indigenous communities in eastern Chiapas that employs principles of Freirean-based popular education to reach academic, cultural, and political objectives. Demanding self-determination and social justice for over 500 years of systemic inequities, these communities revolted against the state in 1994, and established an alternative and egalitarian society, including an education system of their own. This dissertation assesses the goals, workings, and outcomes of Zapatista educational policy, grounded in Freirean-based pedagogy, in one community in eastern Chiapas. Specifically, the assessment determines the extent to which local teachers have implemented a student-centered pedagogy and curriculum and met educational and other objectives at ""La Ceiba Elementary School"" during site visits from July 2007 to January 2010. This qualitative case study responds to previously identified gaps in scholarly research on Zapatista schooling, as well as the challenges of measuring the impact of Freirean-based popular education programs. Particular attention is given to understanding policy implementation as a complex process, especially in what might be considered politically volatile and hostile contexts. In so doing, this dissertation has major policy implications for social change movements that view education as an agency for achieving more just social orders at all levels, from the local to the global.",1640761945,,Dissertations & Theses," Berumen, Juan G.BerumenG.JuanBerumen, Juan G.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3539010731 , 89305962 , 66569 , 9781321387506 , 3665885 , 3665885", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321387506, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1640761945?accountid=14496," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0458 Education Policy , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Education Policy , Latin American Studies"," Social sciences , Education , Community-based participatory research , Concientizacion , Educational policy , Paulo freire , Popular education , Zapatistas",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+complexities+of+praxis%3A+Freirean-based+popular+education%2C%0Aunstable+places%2C+and+implementing+policy+at+a+Zapatista+elementary+school+in+Chiapas%2C+M%C3%A9xico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Berumen%2C+Juan+G.&amp;isbn=9781321387506&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Resisting Displacement Through Culture and Care: Workplace Immigration Raids and the Loop 202 Freeway on Akimel O'odham Land in Phoenix, Arizona, 2012-2014","Low-income communities of color in the U.S. today are often vulnerable to displacement, forced relocation away from the places they call home. Displacement takes many forms, including immigration enforcement, mass incarceration, gentrification, and unwanted development. This dissertation juxtaposes two different examples of displacement, emphasizing similarities in lived experiences. Mixed methods including document-based research, map-making, visual ethnography, participant observation, and interviews were used to examine two case studies in Phoenix, Arizona: (1) workplace immigration raids, which overwhelmingly target Latino migrant workers; and (2) the Loop 202 freeway, which would disproportionately impact Akimel O'odham land. Drawing on critical geography, critical ethnic studies, feminist theory, carceral studies, and decolonial theory, this research considers: the social, economic, and political causes of displacement, its impact on the cultural and social meanings of space, the everyday practices that allow people to survive economically and emotionally, and the strategies used to organize against relocation. Although raids are often represented as momentary spectacles of danger and containment, from a worker's perspective, raids are long trajectories through multiple sites of domination. Raids' racial geographies reinforce urban segregation, while traumatization in carceral space reduces the power of Latino migrants in the workplace. Expressions of care among raided workers and others in jail and detention make carceral spaces more livable, and contribute to movement building and abolitionist sentiments outside detention. The Loop 202 would result in a loss of native land and sovereignty, including clean air and a mountain sacred to O'odham people. While the proposal originated with corporate desire for a transnational trade corridor, it has been sustained by local industry, the perceived inevitability of development, and colonial narratives about native people and land. O'odham artists, mothers, and elders counter the freeway's colonial logics through stories that emphasize balance, collective care over individual profit, and historical consciousness. Both raids and the freeway have been contested by local grassroots movements. Through political education, base-building, advocacy, lawsuits, and protest strategies, community organizations have achieved changes in state practice. These movements have also worked to create alternative spaces of safety and home, rooted in interpersonal care and Latino and O'odham culture.",1640767345,,Dissertations & Theses," Diddams, MargaretDiddamsMargaretDiddams, Margaret",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3539067591 , 87871942 , 66569 , 9781321384550 , 3665659 , 3665659", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321384550, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1640767345?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0630 Public policy , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0366 Geography , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0630 Public policy , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0366 Geography , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0630 Public policy , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0366 Geography , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0630 Public policy , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Geography , Environmental Justice , Public policy , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Carceral geography , Displacement , Environmental justice , Migrant workers , Settler colonialism , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Resisting+Displacement+Through+Culture+and+Care%3A+Workplace+Immigration+Raids+and+the+Loop+202+Freeway+on+Akimel+O%27odham+Land+in+Phoenix%2C+Arizona%2C+2012-2014&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Diddams%2C+Margaret&amp;isbn=9781321384550&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Neighborhood Networks: Social and Spatial Organization of Domestic Architecture in Greco-Roman Karanis, Egypt","My doctoral thesis examines how physical architectural remains preserve ancient concepts of spatial organization and reflect neighborhood social organization. I document the architecture of Karanis, Egypt, a small Greco-Roman town of the Egyptian Fayum (250 B.C.E. to the first half of the seventh century C.E.). Through functional architectural analysis and space syntax analysis, I quantify and compare how private space and social control varied from individual private properties and local neighborhood interactions to the larger system of settlement-wide public access. Previous scholars have suggested that as a Roman province, housing in Greco-Roman Egypt was defiantly conservative of native practices, insular, and isolated from Roman tradition. My research challenges this assumption through the use of space syntax theory to evaluate how architectural spaces reflect networks of social interaction at the level of household, neighborhood, and settlement. Space syntax theory offers a quantifiable method to measure relative values of accessibility and privacy. This study therefore demonstrates that instead of remaining resistant to cultural interaction and change, the inhabitants of Karanis were heavily invested in maintaining complex social networks that transcended binary conceptions of ""private"" versus ""public"" designations of space. The results prove that houses were often accessed by individuals from outside the immediate household group: extended family, friends, visitors, guests, business associates, and any other individuals who may have had cause to enter the house and interact with the inhabitants and their domestic spaces. The creation of local pathways and shortcuts through neighboring properties facilitated movement and provided alternative routes to the public street system. Because access to privately-owned land had to be granted by the owner, the use of these alternate routes required negotiation and interpersonal agreements which created and reinforced social ties between neighbors. Thus the architecture of Karanis was designed to foster varying degrees communal interaction, and adaptations over time show that private property owners strove to balance their own needs and rights to privacy with the essential social role of maintaining good relationships with their neighbors.

While recent scholarly accounts of literacy brokers—defined as individuals assisting others with writing—approach brokers mainly for their instrumental role as translators, editors, or scribes, my study proposes that literacy brokers’ emotional work of mediation must be further explored. I argue that literacy brokers perform mediation through what I call “literacy as affinity.” “Literacy as affinity,” an emotional discursive repertoire, comprises empathetic language, personal stories, and social connections embedded in the literate experience. Literacy as affinity intervenes in contexts of people’s mobility in spaces of in-betweenness, of transitions, and gaps in one’s experience. In doing so, it creates bridges of communication but also provides a sustainable infrastructure for one’s learning. In this study, I approach the brokers’ work of affinity in multiple contexts—local communities, schools, libraries, and courtrooms—and through the lens of various types of brokers such as the state, community members, and various organizations. Drawing on thirty-two literacy history interviews, textual artifacts (travel documents, personal writings/ notes, advertisements for community events, ethnic newspapers), and archival research in Romania, I show how brokers’ work of affinity is experienced both as a loss and recovery of familiar texts, languages, and contexts. With each chapter, I follow the immigrant journey. After providing an overview of transnational mobility in the Introduction, in Chapter two I start my analysis of literacy brokers in Romania where the immigrant story begins. I emphasize the role of the totalitarian Romanian state in managing people’s affinities for the nation through literacy. Following the immigrant journey, in Chapter three and four I discuss the brokers’ emotional investment as it unfolds in the lives of political refugees (Chapter three) and economic immigrants (Chapter four). The regulation of the personal through documents and institutional bureaucracies creates spaces of in-betweenness where brokers intervene to facilitate mediation. Such spaces may be marked by lack of English knowledge, limited familiarity with documents or legal writing, or gaps in cultural knowledge. In Chapter five, I examine the writing researcher as a broker and various affinities developed through personal, institutional, national or international affiliations. In this dissertation, I argue that literacy brokers and their use of literacy as affinity provide a compelling case for why literacy education must acknowledge individual needs rather than instrumental ways to accomplish educational goals. At a time when universities try to acclimatize to digital, open courses and mass migration, my dissertation suggests that literacy brokers’ work of affinity serves both as a motivational support and a driving engine in accomplishing literate actions. To this end, literacy as affinity can offer a sustainable system for the literate experience, as it concerns the entire process of one’s literacy trajectory, both in and out of school. Sustainability and transfer are current concerns in education and this study offers a small intervention in this area by directing attention to the role of emotions in learning.",1642406847,,Dissertations & Theses," Mihut, Ligia AnaMihutAnaLigiaMihut, Ligia Ana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3546756891 , 93020972 , 66569 , 9781321365924 , 3646583 , 3646583", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321365924, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1642406847?accountid=14496," 0314 Slavic literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0314 Slavic literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0681 Rhetoric"," 0314 Slavic literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0681 Rhetoric",," 0314 Slavic literature , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0681 Rhetoric"," Slavic literature , Ethnic studies , Rhetoric"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Affinity , Emotion , Immigrants , Literacy brokers , Sponsor , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%22Stories+from+our+people%22%3A+Immigrants%2C+brokers%2C+and+literacy+as+affinity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mihut%2C+Ligia+Ana&amp;isbn=9781321365924&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Cross-border M&amp;amp;A deal incompletion: Institutional processes and outcomes,"My objective in this dissertation was to understand the processes leading to incompletion of the high profile cross-border deals. A conceptual framework was developed which suggests that announcement of a cross-border merger and acquisition (M&amp; A) deal starts a string of institutional processes that leads to incompletion of the bid. I proposed that less powerful host country actors threatened by the MNC’s bid proposal politicize the transaction turning the deal into a transgression. These actors publicize this transgression, initiating a scandal, to gather support of multiple audiences in their attempts to thwart the threat that the MNC poses. Thanks to their efforts in appealing to audiences and publicization of the deal as a transgression, these actors mobilize audiences who reveal hostile reaction against the MNC and the proposed bid. Such mobilization and hostile reaction, in turn, lead to proposed bid’s incompletion. Qualitative analysis results based on a sample of seven high profile cross-border transactions provided support for the conceptualized processes, namely politicization, scandal, mobilization and hostile reaction, while indicating a different order of process progression compared to the linear one conceptualized. I found that in all cases the process of scandal subsumed the other processes that kept scandal alive. In turn, scandal fed these processes giving more leverage to the mobilization efforts and/or increasing the hostility of the actors opposing the deal. The findings revealed that these processes happened simultaneously and that in cases where mobilization did not emerge, hostile reaction substituted for the lack of mobilization. Additionally, analysis showed that not only less powerful actors but also powerful actors, elites, sought to initiate a scandal when the host country political, legal or bureaucratic processes did not work for them in thwarting the deal. This dissertation by examining social construction, power and politics within the host country institutional environment in the context of high profile cross-border deals, presented a framework that explained how and why the hostility leading to deal incompletion emerges in the host country. In so doing, this dissertation strengthens institutional theory, theory of scandal, social movements theory and elite theory as powerful perspectives in international strategic-management.",1642727628,,Dissertations & Theses," Yapici, NiluferYapiciNiluferYapici, Nilufer",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3548226391 , 89277872 , 66569 , 9781321404029 , 3647566 , 3647566", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321404029, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1642727628?accountid=14496, 0454 Management, 0454 Management, 0454 Management,, 0454 Management, Management," Social sciences , Case study , Cross-border M&A , Deal completion , Institutional theory , Mergers and acquisitions , Qualitative research , Scandal",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cross-border+M%26amp%3BA+deal+incompletion%3A+Institutional+processes+and+outcomes&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yapici%2C+Nilufer&amp;isbn=9781321404029&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Transforming Indigenous Performance in Contemporary South Korean Theatre: The Case of Sohn JinCh'aek's Madangnori,"Contemporary South Korean theatre of the twenty-first century has actively embraced the reproduction of indigenous tradition. Productions marked with Korean cultural codes are now a format for success among domestic and non-domestic audiences. Today, the revivalist movement of Korean indigenous arts is widely recognized as a pathway to the global market. The aim of this movement is to establish “Koreannesque theatre,” that accurately represents Korean culture, as a competitor among other national or ethnic theatres. Ultimately, this revitalization demonstrates an unceasing longing for “national theatre,” or theatre that proudly represents Korean culture and sentiments to others. Here, the adjectives “Korean” and “Koreannesque” take on a nationalistic meaning that presupposes ethnically unique Korean features that broadly refer to the indigenous or traditional customs and culture prior to the influence of Japanese colonization and Western influence. The objective of this study is to critically examine South Korean director Sohn JinCh'aek's creatively revived form of madangnori , an indigenous outdoor performance marked by theatrical story-telling and musical-like quality. The study investigates how Sohn contradicted contemporary society and artistic direction, and how he sought to establish a new theatre genre unique and native to Korean ethnic identity. By examining madangnori 's social and artistic relations with the representative theatrical work at that time, I will locate its place within the domestic and international domains. At the same time, I will explore the uniqueness of this uncommon and unrecognized theatrical form, which was ironically, made popular by a mainstream theatre director. This dissertation also indexes the rich matrix of events which led to the creation of madangnori and to its unusually long-term success; “Long-term” relative to other theatrical forms in South Korean theatre. I will examine the somewhat unclear relationship between madangnori and two stylistically similar genres, ch'angguˇk and madangguˇk. Chfangguˇk is a modernized adaptation of p'ansori which is performed as an opera. Madangguˇk is a modernized adaptation of mask dance drama which shared great stylistic similarities with Sohn's earlier productions before madangnori settled down as a specific performance genre after the 1990s. Ch'angguˇk and madangguˇk were created and promoted by different political groups, yet madangnori partly share the stylistic and ideological directions with them. I argue that Sohn's work has more in common with these two theatre genres more than with the two contemporary directors, Oh T'aeSoˇk and Lee YunT'aek, whose work also have been discussed under the “modernization of tradition.” To varying degrees, madangnori, ch'fangguˇk , and madangguˇk aimed to formulate a “national” theatre and a “folk” theatre, an objective shared by Oh and Lee. While their objectives and medium seem to overlap with Sohn, Oh and Lee chose vastly different means for executing their aims. This study is an attempt to call attention, in both Korean and international theatre scholarship, to the mapping of contemporary Korean theatre through the lens of Sohn's work, the madangnori .

Four key discursive threads provided continuity between the interwar, postwar, and post-Thaw years, despite the social and political devastations of World War II and its aftermath. These were discussions about Polish backwardness, cultural dissemination ( upowszechnienie kultury ), genius, and national tradition. Together, these threads constituted a foundation upon which composers, intellectuals, and political leaders could work to stimulate Polish cultural progress. The powerful trope of Poland's cultural backwardness facilitated exchange and cooperation between the cultural and political spheres. The strategic wielding of this language generated propulsive energy, as participants came together to ameliorate backwardness and to achieve its opposite condition, forwardness. In this context, the concept of an ""avant-garde movement"" was naturally very attractive. It was always important, though, that this avant-gardism be particularly suited to the Polish context, and that it not be derivative. Beginning in the immediate postwar period, there was a push to define a course towards cultural, musical progress that would engage and activate the Polish audience, that would generate meaningful, expressive art, and that would represent the Polish national identity on an international stage. Towards these ends, cultural and political actors worked to build cultural institutions that would cultivate elite and mass audiences, such as the Experimental Studio at Polish Radio and the musical journal Ruch Muzyczny. Critics constructed a discourse of genius around Witold Lutoslawski, whose Funeral Music (1958) modeled the synthesis of technical innovation and musical meaning. Polish avant-gardism was subsequently built upon this institutional and aesthetic foundation, as critics and scholars applied the language of innovation, expressivity, and tradition to a new generation of composers, including Henryk Mikolaj Górecki and Krzysztof Penderecki. In this way, balancing their competing political and aesthetic allegiances, composers, intellectuals and political ideologues were able to establish shared goals and commitments and, therefore, to work together to generate vibrant forms of cultural growth.",1648414750,,Dissertations & Theses," Vest, Lisa CooperVestCooperLisaVest, Lisa Cooper",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3570313471 , 85969412 , 66569 , 9781321444247 , 3669007 , 3669007", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321444247, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1648414750?accountid=14496," 0413 Music , 0437 East European Studies , 0650 Aesthetics"," 0413 Music , 0437 East European Studies , 0650 Aesthetics"," 0413 Music , 0437 East European Studies , 0650 Aesthetics",," 0413 Music , 0437 East European Studies , 0650 Aesthetics"," Music , East European Studies , Aesthetics"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Avant-garde , Backwardness , Communism and music , Penderecki, krzysztof , Poland , Witold, lutosławski",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+discursive+foundations+of+the+Polish+musical+avant-garde+at+midcentury%3A+Aesthetics+of+progress%2C+meaning%2C+and+national+identity&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Vest%2C+Lisa+Cooper&amp;isbn=9781321444247&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Seinendan: Youth Associations as Social Technology in Late Meiji and Taishō Japan,"This thesis is an investigation into the rise of the rural youth association (seinendan) movement in Japan, focusing on the period from around 1890 to the first years of World War I.

American self-immolations were extreme political acts of self-sacrifice. They were a form of nonviolent protest inspired by the Buddhist religious tradition in Vietnam, but also had a historical context rooted in a uniquely American nonviolent tradition that encompasses the Quakers, Abolitionists, and Civil Rights Movement. American self-immolations occurred in greater numbers than the historiography shows and were deliberate acts of protest and solidarity. This dissertation examines the history of self-immolation in Asia and its role as social protest. It discusses the 1963 Buddhist Crisis in South Vietnam and the international response. It covers the tradition of nonviolent protest in the United States. It presents case studies of American self-immolations and the media response, both domestic and international, to these acts.

Lusk and Francis J. Murnane,"Catholic Action was an international movement that encouraged active promotion of the Catholic faith by ordinary believers. While the idea gained force at a local level in Italy in the early twentieth century, Pope Pius XI gave the philosophy official Church approval in 1931. Catholic Action served as a major intellectual and religious force among American Catholics from the Great Depression until the transformations in Catholicism caused by the Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965. The program encouraged American Catholics both to promote the practice of the faith among fellow Church members and to express Catholic teachings in the public realm in order to influence political and economic policy. Because the Church's social teaching articulated strong reservations regarding free-market capitalism, Catholic Action proved compelling to progressives and leftists among the faithful. American Catholic leftists during this era continued a long tradition of social justice activism among Catholic immigrant workers and their descendants. Yet Catholic political mobilization could also serve conservative ends, as when believers gathered in rallies against Hollywood movies or communism. Regardless of whether they engaged in progressive or conservative activism, however, Catholics' organized efforts in the mid-twentieth century fortified their already strong sense of religious identity. This thesis examines two Catholic public figures in Portland, Oregon during the era of Catholic Action: Hall S. Lusk, a lawyer who held many public offices including that of Oregon Supreme Court Justice, and Francis J. Murnane, a leader in the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. Biographies of the two men demonstrate that the two served as important spokesmen for Catholic principles in mostly non-Catholic Portland. While Lusk viewed Catholic Action as an opportunity to strengthen American Catholics' devotion to the nation, Murnane's version authorized radical dissent against the nation's social and economic structure. An analytical chapter examines how the same Catholic Action philosophy drove the two men in different directions politically but imbued each with a strong sense of Catholic identity. The Conclusion discusses the continued relevance of the study of the Catholic Action period by pointing to the surprising durability of Catholic cultural cohesion throughout American history and to the powerful force that religious faith possesses to inspire activists on both the left and the right.",1651241077,,Dissertations & Theses," Berge, Ian AlanBergeAlanIanBerge, Ian Alan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3579340541 , 90368342 , 66569 , 9781321475272 , 1572737 , 1572737", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321475272, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1651241077?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history"," Religious history , American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , American Catholicism , Catholic action , Catholics , Oregon",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Catholic+Action+in+Twentieth-Century+Oregon%3A+The+Divergent+Political+and+Social+Philosophies+of+Hall+S.+Lusk+and+Francis+J.+Murnane&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Berge%2C+Ian+Alan&amp;isbn=9781321475272&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Styles of Struggle: Community Organizing, Youth Culture, and Radical Politics in New York City, 1968-1981","Styles of Struggle: Community Organizing, Youth Culture, and Radical Politics in New York City, 1968-1981 builds on a recent historiographic trend challenging narratives of the 1970s as a period of conservative retrenchment, and demonstrates that the multiracial, anti-imperialist visions fueling the radical dreams of the 1960s continued to inform local struggle in what me might call the ""long 1970s.""

Local efforts to transform social and spatial relations drew on a longer history of anti-racist and anti-imperialist organizing. By the late 1970s, activists combined the two threads into a powerful critique of the resurgent frontier discourse used to justify neglect or destruction of the city's minority communities. From the multiracial Black Theatre of Urban Arts Corps to the largely Puerto Rican United Bronx Parents' fight for community control of education, from the tenuous alliances of Columbia students and Harlem activists to South Bronx youth partnering with avant-garde art gallery Fashion Moda, communities in struggle worked to develop a range of approaches for survival and self-determination. I conclude by analyzing how these practices came together in 1980-81 protests against the anti-Black and anti-Puerto Rican film Fort Apache: The Bronx, when hip hop culture was first explicitly deployed as a political organizing tool. Contributing to Civil Rights, popular culture, and social movement historiographies, Styles of Struggle locates the historical continuities of the long 1960s against what is often characterized as a point of rupture, interrogates the relationship between transnational and local politics, and demonstrates how expressive culture shapes and sustains ongoing struggles for social justice into the 21st century.",1652566795,,Dissertations & Theses," Edwards, Cutler CurtisEdwardsCurtisCutlerEdwards, Cutler Curtis",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3584496971 , 91724562 , 66569 , 9781321516463 , 3673974 , 3673974", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321516463, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1652566795?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history"," American studies , American history"," Social sciences , Community organizing , Hip hop , New york , Popular culture , Race and ethnicity , Radical politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Styles+of+Struggle%3A+Community+Organizing%2C+Youth+Culture%2C+and+Radical+Politics+in+New+York+City%2C+1968-1981&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Edwards%2C+Cutler+Curtis&amp;isbn=9781321516463&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Who I am I must become: Sense of self of single, child-free professional women in the retirement transition","One important new global sociological phenomenon of the 21st century is the rise of elite single professional women worldwide, who have important roles as trailblazers. The Civil Rights and Women's Movements disrupted historical power systems and altered race relations, the workplace, women's lives, marriage patterns, and transformed retirement for this generation of retirees. Empirical research about always single, child-free professional women (ASCFPW) is scarce due to their minority status and the social bias toward married women; The lived experience of this minority population is often overshadowed in studies by the greater percentage of single-again women—widowed, divorced, or separated women with very different life experiences—with whom they are traditionally grouped in research. Simultaneously this population is increasing and can be role models for majority women who become single again as they age. The respectful acronym and neutral terminology of ASCFPW (always single, child-free, professional woman) is used; traditional research labels of ""never married"" and ""childless"" are negative, and ostracizing, therefore eschewed in this report. This qualitative, multiple case investigation focuses on the lived retirement transition for seven ASCFPW in the first five years of retirement. How does the sense of self of the ASCFPW evolve from her career to a meaningful retirement lifestyle that integrates service, activism or creative praxis (activism in the arts, or a woman's unique creative strategy for service to her community) while embracing her new learning and evolving identity? How does the loss of professional identity at retirement impact the ASCFPW whose career was a significant part of her sense of self, salient roles, and life focus? Their partial life history interviews reveal intelligent, engaged women who excelled in their careers then create a meaningful retirement lifestyle that includes community service, social activism, or creative praxis. Their narratives' data yield meaningful findings to add to existing older women's retirement literature on wholistic retirement planning, career patterns, professional identity versus work identity, the sense of self, new learning, and other surprises. Both transformative learning theory and adult development models are discussed as relevant.

In particular, it challenges the default national frame of most gay movement historiography by putting the ""special relationships"" of homophile activists in dynamic tension with the ""special relationship"" of Anglo-American exchange. In the years following World War II, social identification based on homosexuality was both newly viable and intensely stigmatized in Europe and North America. Homophiles in a variety of countries began to organize on the basis of common sexuality but, struggling against disdain, often found their claims to basic civil protections and dignity mocked. Many therefore reached beyond their immediate communities of citizenship to forge legitimating solidarities with an emerging diaspora of activist groups. Capturing this perspective is an act of recovery, but it also provides tools to reappraise the history of sexuality. It opens up a whole ""Intimate Atlantic"" across which ideas, texts, and people—marginalized in their home cultures—insistently circulated. And it clarifies cross-cultural currents that helped to shape national stories of sexual identity and politics, dating in my study from the immediate postwar years to the gay liberation era. Guided by homophile interests, each chapter advances the overall chronology through a shifting focus on ""Atlantic Crossings."" Chapter One recovers the significance of Alfred Kinsey's 1948 study Sexual Behavior in the Human Male to the takeoff of postwar European homophile activism and tracks its reception in Britain. Factoring in nationalist sentiment and the changing relations of family life to explain Kinsey's impact on British sexual politics, I map mainstream and subcultural coverage of the US professor's research to show how Britain hosted sites promoting homophile expression even while lacking formal homophile organizations. Chapter Two investigates the backlash to sexual sensationalism that in Britain achieved strong expression through a spate of gay scandals soon after the 1953 publication of Kinsey's Sexual Behavior in the Human Female —a pattern noted by homophile groups across the ocean, sensitive to policing and publicity. Demonstrating that ""Lavender Scare"" anxieties stretched along a transatlantic axis, I nevertheless argue that the spectacle of US McCarthyism's privacy violations conditioned British sensitivities in a way that extended an ethic of minority protection towards homosexuals. I thus offer a new interpretation of the British government's 1954 decision to set up a committee on homosexual offences. Chapter Three shows how the result of that enquiry, the 1957 Wolfenden Report, elaborated a jurisprudence of sexual privacy that exerted strong influence in the United States, helping to enact a critical Anglo-American ideological shift towards legitimating sexual privacy, with impact beyond the homophile movement. Charting Wolfenden's progress through legal circles, I show how this British report—together with the associated Hart-Devlin debate over criminal law and morality—precipitated the 1965 Supreme Court decision in Griswold that discovered a constitutional right to privacy, though in terms of marital intimacy rather than homosexuality. By tracing homophile responses to these legalistic circulations, I emphasize the ability of transnational grassroots resourcefulness to surmount the stigma of criminalization even without enacted changes to the law. This is an argument the dissertation's final two chapters further explore. While Wolfenden advocated ""private morality,"" Chapter Four notes how the report's legitimation of homosexuality as a topic paradoxically led to a paradigm shift in publicity, producing a ""queer cultural wave"" that surged from Britain towards the United States against the prevailing currents of Americanization. At a time when US cultural producers endured more restrictive censorship constraints than British counterparts, Britain's relatively depathologized representations of homosexuality appeared particularly valuable to US homophiles and encouraged movement leaders by the mid-1960s to seek their own publicity breakthroughs. Chapter Five examines the transatlantic conditions that one year after Westminster decriminalized gay sex in private led US homophiles to adopt a distinctly moralistic slogan of ""gay is good."" Applying transnational perspective to late 1960s law reform and revolt on the cusp of the gay liberation era, I examine a moment that might be taken as the pinnacle of Anglo-American homophile exchange, but emphasize the important role played by conflict as well as connection in shaping the evolving positions of activists and authorities alike. Finally, my Epilogue concludes by contemplating the quality of transatlantic ""special relationships"" gained and lost as homophile activism entered the gay liberation era.",1658571908,,Dissertations & Theses," Minto, DavidMintoDavidMinto, David",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3606394641 , 94362062 , 66569 , 9781321598353 , 3582167 , 3582167", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014, 9781321598353, English, English,,2014,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1658571908?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0506 World History"," 0337 American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0506 World History"," 0337 American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0506 World History",," 0337 American history , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0506 World History"," American history , GLBT Studies , World History", Social sciences,http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Special+Relationships%3A+Transnational+Homophile+Activism+and+Anglo-American+Sexual+Politics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Minto%2C+David&amp;isbn=9781321598353&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Socioeconomic status and prosperity belief in Guatemala,"A popular belief in the exploding Pentecostal movement in the global South is the idea that if an individual has enough faith, God will bless them with financial prosperity. Although historically Pentecostalism has been identified as a religion of the poor, this study examines recent arguments that the current Pentecostal movement in Guatemala is a religion of the socially mobile middle and elite classes. Data from the Pew Forum on Religious and Public Life’s 2006 survey Spirit and Power: Survey of Pentecostals in Guatemala is used to conduct a logistic regression, in order to measure the effects of socioeconomic status on adherence to prosperity belief. Results suggest that, contrary to the current literature on Guatemalan Pentecostalism, prosperity belief is not necessarily concentrated among the upwardly mobile middle and upper classes, but rather is widely diffused across social strata, and in particular, among those that have lower levels of education.

Through the assessment of one such program, the researcher sought to find out the essential components of the partnership including how the two partner organizations interact and work together. Data was collected using various methods: document review of organization documents such as newsletters, annual or quarterly reports, brochures and other available literature e.g. materials on organizations’ website and on social media; in-depth interviews with stakeholders of both organizations that included staff and board members; observation of staff working; and participant observation during organization events. The findings of the research shows that in order for organizations to have an effective partnership program in place, both partners need to have strong leadership in place, possess a willingness to learn from each other, maintain regular communication, and visit each other regularly. With this in place, several outcomes of the program are likely such as: increasing advocacy for hospice and palliative care, increasing visibility of the organizations both nationally and internationally, and provides an opportunity for organizations to network with other organizations in their locality in order to achieve partnership objectives. The study further reveals that global collaborations in the field of hospice and palliative care began with the advent of the international hospice movement.

Through a phenomenological study of 20 young adults from British Columbia who care about the environment, the research focuses on how the group views modern environmentalism. The findings indicate that the participants believe environmentalism is in transition, and they are optimistic about their role in the changes that are under way. The emerging interpretation retains strong continuity with the past, but notably emphasizes people, a deeply personal view of how one lives a sustainable life, a new localism, a focus on community organizing grounded in social media, and a hopeful narrative predicated on solutions.

The earliest approach to address the problem was founded on a moral ground but adopted a law enforcement strategy by criminalising the procurement of women for prostitution. Consequently consent at the time was discountenanced in favour of the end purpose for which the women were moved. This approach prevailed over a long period until the adoption of the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, Supplementing the United Nations Convention against Transnational Organized Crime (Trafficking Protocol) in 2000. The Trafficking Protocol adopts a three thronged (prevention, protection and prosecution) approach to combating human trafficking. Whilst this is a novel approach the Trafficking Protocol makes consent irrelevant only when the movement of the women is procured through coercion. Accordingly consent or lack of consent became an essential element for distinguishing trafficking from other migratory crimes such as human smuggling. The challenge of applying consent as criterion to differentiate human trafficking from human smuggling particularly becomes problematical when applied to the movement of women for prostitution. This is especially so in the light of feminists’ debate on whether prostitution should be conceptualised as sex work or as violence against women. To establish consent or lack of consent in the context of the Trafficking Protocol is complicated, inexhaustive framing of the consent nullifying elements ignores country specific and cultural practices in recruitment of women for prostitution. This thesis demonstrates the complexity of using consent as a criterion to determine whether Nigerian women moved into Italy are trafficked or voluntary agents. In doing so the thesis highlights the extent to which the interpretation of consent may be influenced by social, cultural and socio-legal issues. This thesis accentuate juju oath ritual and debt bondage as frequently employed to recruit and move Nigerian women into prostitution as consent nullifying elements.",1774183989,,Dissertations & Theses," Aluko-Daniels, O.

Although its roots stretched back to the early twentieth century, the post-war English folk revival significantly occurred in the context of the nation’s de-industrialisation, and exposed tensions between, on the one hand, a nostalgic lament for a fast-disappearing working class life, and a ‘forward-looking’ socialist vision of working-class culture. The original contribution to knowledge of this project lies in its analytic approach to the English folk revival as an important part of the post-war political culture. It looks at the revival from the outside in, and contextualizes the movement in the social and political story of post-war England, while also placing it within a dynamic transnational framework, a complex cross-Atlantic cultural exchange with its more well-known American contemporary. In so doing, this thesis contributes to the existing historiographies of folk revivalism in England, as well as the social and political historiographical discourses of the postwar period: the continued salience of class in English society; the transformation of the nation’s economic infrastructures; the social and political influence of the Welfare State – the folk revival tapped into all of these overlapping strands, and helped to magnify them.",1777322680,,Dissertations & Theses," Mitchell, J.

Grime music, a black Atlantic creative expression, is used as a lens through which to explore and analyse the nature of entrepreneurship within this sector. East London, a site of poverty, movement and migration is the geographical starting point for the project. Over a five-year period from 2007 – 2012, ethnographic field research was carried out in London and Ayia Napa, Cyprus. Forty semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants in the sector. In addition, participant observation was undertaken in various settings including pirate radio stations, nightclubs and music video shoots. The global reach of those who operate within the urban music sector is highly visible and this sector has a significant socio-economic impact. Practitioners utilise advances in technology as well as innovative business practice to create opportunities for self-employment on a local, national and international scale. Grime music and its related enterprise culture is a mechanism for social and economic mobility particularly for those from ethnically stigmatised communities.

From the early 1940s a group of pacifists developed an understanding of war as embedded in the racial, national and grossly unequal socio~economic system. Drawing on Gandhism, Marxism and anarchism, they argued that pacifists could no longer refuse to participate in war alone but needed a repertoire of nonviolent, interventionist and obstructionist techniques which could act as a functional substitute for violence in securing social and political· change. The thesis uses episodes from the biography of civil rights and peace activist Bayard Rustin to map the historical geography of radical pacifism across three continents. I argue that radical pacifism was a profoundly racialized and geographical undertaking which helped forge a particular American relationship with the post~war world. At the dawn of the atomic age, radical pacifists became key exponents of a form of 'One Worldism' which sought to emphasize global forms of citizenship and affiliation. By examining radical pacifism within wider geographical literature on internationalism, cosmopolitanism and the global, this thesis enhances our understanding of peace as a spatially constituted process. Moreover, radical pacifists' global vision coalesced with a historical period in which race relations were being transformed on a planetary scale. In adapting an explicitly Gandhian campaign in the American South and exporting it to liberation movements in sub ~Saharan Africa, radical pacifists promoted a global sense of the shared struggle against racial exploitation. By pulling together struggles from Montgomery to Accra experiments in 'revolutionary nonviolence' were always more than a tactical persuasion alone, but also a means to embed and (re )shape racial solidarity itself, often across vast political and geographical distances. Working with the likes of Nnamdi Azikiwe, Kenneth Kaunda, Martin Luther KingJr., Jawaharlal Nehru and K wame Nkrumah, radical pacifists like Rustin had remarkable access to some of the leading figures of the twentieth century. Yet, rooted between their tactics and their aspiration lay the spatial paradox of pacifism: the universalism of its One World vision stood in direct opposition to their strategic access to anti~ colonial nationalist movements. The thesis shows how the fortunes of radical pacifists waxed and waned as they came to terms with the disorderliness of politics, place, and the problem of geography.",1779546004,,Dissertations & Theses," Hodder, JakeHodderJakeHodder, Jake",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4015191221 , 103112712 , 101309 , 10083228 , 10083228", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1779546004?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10083228 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Bayard+rustin+and+the+historical+geographies+of+radical+pacifism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hodder%2C+Jake&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Caricom and the politics of migration: securitisation and the free movement of community nationals in barbados,"This thesis seeks to understand how the ‘free movement of CARICOM nationals’ (FMCN) and intra-regional migration have become securitised in Barbados. The key aim of the thesis is to understand the social facts constitutive of the FMCN in Barbados. The thesis presents data on key securitising actors and audiences in Barbados. It analyses how Caribbean Community (CARICOM) migrants are understood to be posing threats and dangers to the Barbadian society and/or state. The processes, interactions, and discursive practices that lead to these conditions of security/insecurity are then examined in more detail. The thesis, on the basis of an instrumental case study of Barbados, advances social constructivism and the Copenhagen School’s concept of securitisation as the most appropriate theoretical framework for gaining an understanding on the FMCN and intra-CARICOM migration dynamics. Primary data are drawn from a selection of methods incorporating elite interviews with key state/institutional leaders and the media. This method is complimented with documentary research in the format of parliamentary debates; government speeches and reports; books and journals; communiqués; and newspaper articles. The thesis engages with critical discourse analysis in order to gain analytical purchase on agency within domestic and international structures. It argues that market forces, material conditions, cultural constraints, and technological forces are crucial indicators for any reading of the securitisations taking place in the transnational and national spaces of CARICOM. The key findings and analyses show significant challenges for Barbados regarding perceptions of national versus regional identities. With the functioning of the FMCN, the social construction of fear and mistrust leads to grave misunderstandings among multiple actors. The thesis’ original contribution stems from analysing the securitisation dynamics underpinning FMCN and intra-CARICOM migration in Barbados and CARICOM.",1780249817,,Dissertations & Theses," Brathwaite, George ChristopherBrathwaiteChristopherGeorgeBrathwaite, George Christopher",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018897051 , 102698752 , 101309 , 10075810 , 10075810 , http://hdl.handle.net/10443/2561", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780249817?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/10443/2561 , (UMI)AAI10075810 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Caricom+and+the+politics+of+migration%3A+securitisation+and+the+free+movement+of+community+nationals+in+barbados&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Brathwaite%2C+George+Christopher&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Urban renewal projects and dynamics of contention in istanbul: the cases of fener-balat-ayvansaray and suleymaniye,"The main aim of this thesis is to examine urban movements in Istanbul, Turkey. More specifically, the research has two principal objectives: first, to expand the existing conceptual framework of urban movement studies by critically examining the present literature on urban movements and considering people’s experiences in the cities of global South; and second, to make an empirical contribution to the literature on urban movements in general and the developing literature on urban movements in Turkey, in particular by analysing political mobilisation surrounding contested urban regeneration projects in Istanbul, Turkey. The thesis argues that the research framework of current urban movements’ literature is too static and limited to be able to develop a dynamic, relational and comparative approach to the analysis of mobilisation in urban space in different geographies. The case materials presented demonstrate that the political and social relations established between actors of urban politics are enmeshed in a dynamic political process, and that the motivations that inform the development of urban movements can change over time. In addition, the issues causing conflicts and political mobilisation are perceived and experienced differently under different conditions, which results in a diversification of the ways in which mobilisation is pursued. As such, a-priori assumptions about the emergence and goals of political mobilisation in urban space – for example, assumptions that urban movements necessarily are progressive and a part of a wider political agenda – is shown to be inadequate for examining the dynamics of mobilisation in different settings. In developing these theoretical arguments, the research constructs a dynamic relational framework to the analysis of political mobilisation in urban space, contributing in turn to the existing conceptual framework of urban movement and political mobilisation studies. Empirically, these issues were explored through case studies of two urban renewal areas in the historical neighbourhoods of Istanbul, Turkey, using a qualitative Critical Realist methodology. Like many other megacities, Istanbul has experienced an immense process of socio-economic and spatial restructuring in which the state has played a fundamental role. Moreover, in these new urbanisation dynamics, urban renewal projects have become conspicuously contested, leading to mobilisation at a variety of spatial and governmental scales. This thesis focuses on the different responses of local people in two urban renewal areas in order to examine the factors that enable and inhibit mobilisation. Specifically, the research is framed around two contrasting cases: the Fener-Balat-Ayvansaray renewal area, which is taken as a case of political action, and the Suleymaniye renewal area, which is taken as the case of inaction. The research findings show that the intervention of the state is not the only factor causing mobilisation in the localities. Other factors include: the condition of the built environment and the formation of spatial relations in the localities; the condition of the property market and how property owners value their assets in terms of its exchange and use values; the political relations between the state and the residents; social relations within the localities; and the implementation process of the urban renewal projects. These factors are derived from the empirical findings of the research and combined into a dynamic conceptual framework that contributes to reconfiguring existing analyses of urban movements. As such, by its critical relationship to existing urban social movement theory and through its novel methodology, the thesis aims to make significant contributions both to the conceptualisation and empirical analysis of contentious politics in urban space.",1780282019,,Dissertations & Theses," Turkmen, HadeTurkmenHadeTurkmen, Hade",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018889351 , 89355702 , 101309 , 10077573 , 10077573 , http://orca.cf.ac.uk/73541/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780282019?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://orca.cf.ac.uk/73541/ , (UMI)AAI10077573 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Urban+renewal+projects+and+dynamics+of+contention+in+istanbul%3A+the+cases+of+fener-balat-ayvansaray+and+suleymaniye&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Turkmen%2C+Hade&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The art worlds of punk-inspired feminist networks: a social network analysis of the ladyfest feminist music and cultural movement in the uk,"Riot Grrrl, Girls Rock camps and Ladyfest as social movements act as intermediaries in cultural production spaces, where music focused artefacts are made, collaborations forged, distribution networks established and reception practices enacted to create new conventions which can be understood as feminist art worlds. The growing literature on gender and cultural production, particularly in music communities such as Riot Grrrl, frequently speak of networks in qualitative narrative terms and very little is known about Ladyfest as a feminist movement and as a distribution network. This thesis offers an original contribution to cultural sociology by: employing a novel participatory action research approach to gathering social network data on translocal feminist music based cultural organisations; exploring how these networks can challenge a gendered political economy of cultural production in music worlds; understanding who participates and why; investigating how network structures impact the personal relationships, participation and collaboration opportunities for those involved. Engaging with Howard Becker’s Art Worlds theory as a framework, this thesis explores how music and art by women is produced, distributed and received by translocal networks. It takes into account contemporary issues for feminist music-based communities as well as the historical and international context of these overlapping and developing social movements. The literature suggests that one of the most pressing tasks for a sociology of the arts is to understand how organisational structures negotiate the domains of production, distribution and reception, with distribution modes being the most the most under-researched of the three. By focusing on UK Ladyfest festivals as case study sites, this research serves to address these gaps. Primary data sources include on-line social media, surveys, documents, focus groups and multi-mediainterviews. Findings indicate that those involved with Ladyfest tend to be motivated by a desire to challenge gender inequalities at a local level whilst drawing on local and international movements spanning different time periods and drawing on the works of feminist musicians. Homophily and heterophily both have important roles to play in the longitudinal development of Ladyfest networks. Participants show an awareness of intersecting inequalities such as ethnicity, class and disability with sexuality playing an important underlying role for the development of relationships within the networks. For some, Ladyfest involvement is a gateway into feminist activism and wider social and cultural participation, and for many it leads to lasting friendships and new collaborative artbased ties.",1780282051,,Dissertations & Theses," O'Shea, Susan MaryO'SheaMarySusanO'Shea, Susan Mary",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3989350211 , 102698822 , 101309 , 10032772 , 10032772 , http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:235567", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780282051?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:235567 , (UMI)AAI10032772 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+art+worlds+of+punk-inspired+feminist+networks%3A+a+social+network+analysis+of+the+ladyfest+feminist+music+and+cultural+movement+in+the+uk&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=O%27Shea%2C+Susan+Mary&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The way out: invisible insurrections and radical imaginaries in the uk underground 1961-1991,"This thesis explores a 'hidden' cultural history of experiments to engineer culture to transform humanity. Through a mixture of ideas drawn from artistic avant-garde movements as well as new social and religious movements, it examines the radical political and hedonist imaginaries of the experimental fringes of the UK Underground. Even though the theatres of operation have changed more than once since 1991 with the rise of the internet and a globalised finance economy, these imaginaries still raise questions that speak directly to the contemporary. My central inquiry examines the relations between collective practices with an explicit agenda of cultural revolution and discourses of direct revolutionary action, cultural guerrilla warfare and patchwork spirituality, all aiming to generate new forms of social life. These expanded practices blurred the lines between inner and outer, the invisible and the material. Four singular concatenations of aesthetics, politics, education and mysticism in the period from 1961 to 1991 are the objects of my examination: the sigma project, London Anti-University, Academy 23 and thee Temple ov Psychick Youth. At the core of these imaginaries is an idea about a new type of 'action university', a communal affair which would improvise a new type of social relation into existence by de-programming and de-conditioning us without any blueprints for the future besides to 'make it happen'. The goal of its production would be to produce new subjectivities, new commons and new social relations, thus realising another world 'in the shell of the old' through simple acts of pooling resources, sharing knowledge and building international channels for the exchange of information. Instead of being turned upside down, the world was to be changed from the inside out. Besides historicising and contextualising parts of the 1960s underground which has been relegated to footnotes, the thesis promotes a reading which is neither solely aesthetic (artistic avant-garde) nor political (revolutionary communism) but argues that those tendencies are dependent upon each other. Instead, the case studies can be fruitfully examined as examples on cultural engineering, speculative techniques for igniting an invisible insurrection with cultural means. Thus, it contributes to a discussion of art, medias, politics and radical education in the contemporary.",1794899191,,Dissertations & Theses," Frederiksen, Kasper OpstrupFrederiksenOpstrupKasperFrederiksen, Kasper Opstrup",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4082577051 , 103780892 , 101309 , 10122801 , 10122801 , http://bbktheses.da.ulcc.ac.uk/68/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1794899191?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://bbktheses.da.ulcc.ac.uk/68/ , (UMI)AAI10122801 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+way+out%3A+invisible+insurrections+and+radical+imaginaries+in+the+uk+underground+1961-1991&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Frederiksen%2C+Kasper+Opstrup&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Journeys to engagement with the uk global justice movement: life stories of activist-educators,"This thesis explores how individuals in the UK come to and sustain engagement with global justice issues (such as poverty, development and human rights). It responds to a scarcity of relevant research and a stated desire for greater understanding from those involved in development education and related areas. Relevant literature is used to develop: a working definition of the UK Global Justice Movement; a new conceptual framework for understanding forms of engagement; a ‘route map’ summarising knowledge about individuals’ journeys to engagement; and an understanding of current practice and debates in development education and related fields. Using narrative research techniques, the study then presents five individuals’ life stories with respect to engagement with global justice issues. The respondents come from a range of backgrounds and utilise a number of different forms of engagement, but all act in some way as educators/multipliers of engagement. Their stories are analysed using two different ‘lenses’: together, considering themes relevant to development education, and separately, investigating how concepts related to identity (Social Identity Theory, Identity Theory and Narrative Identity) can be used to understand individuals’ engagement. This analysis includes discussion of: the places in which learning happens; debates concerning learning, criticality and visits overseas; the extent to which respondents might be understood to be development educators themselves; roles they have played; the in- (and out-) groups mentioned; and the various sources of narrative available to each of them over the course of their journeys to and within engagement. Finally, the thesis suggests implications for researchers, policy makers and practitioners. This includes: future use of the concepts developed; further exploration of the potential learning value of ‘low cost’ forms engagement; supporting individuals to engage with different organisations and issues ‘across’ the movement; and, considering possibilities for work with families and faith groups.",1827600854,,Dissertations & Theses," Trewby, JamesTrewbyJamesTrewby, James",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209786541 , 103030042 , 101309 , 10174922 , 10174922 , http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/21704/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2014,, English, English,,2014,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2014,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827600854?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.ioe.ac.uk/21704/ , (UMI)AAI10174922 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Journeys+to+engagement+with+the+uk+global+justice+movement%3A+life+stories+of+activist-educators&amp;issn=&amp;date=2014-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Trewby%2C+James&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Institutional Reproduction: Reproduction of the Umma in the U.K. within the Context of the Muslim Council of Britain and Its Key Affiliates,"This dissertation, explores the institutionalization, or lack thereof, of the Islamic politico-legal institution of the umma in the United Kingdom, and asks the questions of whether and how the umma was reproduced or failed to reproduce in the U.K., and what are the conditions, circumstances and mechanisms that have contributed to this process and made the institutional reproduction of the umma more or less likely?

La escena subterránea en Perú durante los años ochenta,"The dissertation investigates a repertoire of ideas and objects produced by the Underground Scene ( Escena Subterránea ) that problematize notions of property within the Peruvian culture and society of the time. This is a young subcultural and countercultural social formation that bonded around rock music and created urban interventions, fiction and non-fiction literature, visual arts and music. My inquiry focuses on how this scene perceived as marginal contested well-established aesthetic practices and believes. I trace the way in which their poems, lyrics, interviews, cassette tapes, covers and prints deal with the expectations of what is appropriate and proper to, often migrant, young mestizo, working-class people within the cultural field. The conditions placed by the Peruvian Internal Conflict (1980-2000) and the migration of rural Peruvians to Lima created a social space where matters of property of land and circulation of people and goods were pivotal to the social experience. Literary and art criticism, along with the historical accounts of music, tend to explain the communal configuration of the scene and its aesthetics in relation to the violence of the armed struggle. These, I argue, also take from the coexistence with the migrants. The Underground Scene produced alongside with a massive marginality of indigenous rural migrants, appropriating their cultural and aesthetic procedures as well as their organizational forms. It worked within the war reflecting upon its various immediate consequences through a generational perspective using tactics borrowed from international subcultures such as the DIY, and others like piracy vastly and successfully used by the migrants. While this influence has been read as purely cultural, I am proposing a material approach. I claim that these conditions of production shaped up in a definitive way what is widely taken as a subculture and counterculture arranged as a mere imitation of the Anglo-Saxon, white, male punk movement.

A critical and comprehensive appreciation of the global ""war on terror"" reveals terrorism ""from above'"" (state-sponsored terrorism) as a growing issue in the international community. Further, women's varied experiences within communities of resistance are often undermined, ignored, or maligned within formal research on conflict and peace. Liberation psychologists are called to align with oppressed, marginalized, and suffering communities. To this end, this work explores the experience of women political prisoners of the Irish conflict for independence from Great Britain. A qualitative critical psychosocial analysis was used to understand the phenomenology of women's political imprisonment through the firsthand narratives of Republican women imprisoned during the ""Troubles"" of Northern Ireland. The intention of this study was to 1) provide an analysis of power and its connection to social conditions, 2) to provide a psychological analysis of how oppression may breed resistance in communities struggling for liberation, and 3) to explore the gendered experience of Irish women political prisoners. The results indicated that political imprisonment may be understood as a microcosm of oppression and liberation, and the subjective experience of political prisoners may glean insights into how communities develop critical consciousness, organize politically, resist oppression, and meaningfully participate in recognizing their human rights. Additionally, this research challenged the exclusion of women's voices as members of resistance movements and active agents in both conflict and peace building and challenged the failure to investigate state-sponsored terrorism, or terrorism from above.",1658770947,,Dissertations & Theses," Murphy, KathleenMurphyKathleenMurphy, Kathleen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3607622731 , 88188812 , 66569 , 9781321582437 , 3683725 , 3683725", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321582437, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1658770947?accountid=14496," 0451 Social psychology , 0563 Peace Studies , 0622 Clinical psychology , 0733 Gender studies"," 0451 Social psychology , 0563 Peace Studies , 0622 Clinical psychology , 0733 Gender studies"," 0451 Social psychology , 0563 Peace Studies , 0622 Clinical psychology , 0733 Gender studies",," 0451 Social psychology , 0563 Peace Studies , 0622 Clinical psychology , 0733 Gender studies"," Social psychology , Peace Studies , Clinical psychology , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Psychology , Conflict transformation , Critical consciousness , Liberation psychology , Northern ireland , Political prisoners , Women",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Critical+Consciousness%2C+Community+Resistance+%26amp%3B+Resilience%3A%0ANarratives+of+Irish+Republican+Women+Political+Prisoners&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Murphy%2C+Kathleen&amp;isbn=9781321582437&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Neoliberal Dystopias: Postmodern Aesthetics and a Modern Ethic in Four Pairs of Plays by Argentine and Irish Playwrights (1990–2003),"This project is an exploration of eight plays, four from Argentina, four from Ireland, comprehending the period between 1990 and 2003. Both countries share a strong tradition of national theatre that, from its beginnings, was closely intertwined with the development of the nation state. Theatre functions in Argentina and Ireland as a medium through which representations of what it means to be Irish or Argentine have been explored, questioned, and contested. It is the aim of this project to examine how the apparently non-political and ahistorical theater of the playwrights I will examine is indeed a response to a contextualized sense of political, social, and economic uncertainty, fueled by globalization. The postmodern aesthetics of the plays go beyond the playful to question how community, identity, and meaning are articulated in a world where national frameworks are being replaced by transnational movements (both economic and cultural). The impact of neoliberal economic policies implemented on Argentina and Ireland in the 90s and the severe displacement and rise of inequality of large sections of the population in both countries is contested, critiqued, and examined in all the plays of my study. In both the Argentine and Irish cases, lingering repressive practices responsible for human rights violations coexisted with an economic neoliberal agenda that generated its own particular set of discriminations, abuses, and diminish citizenships. This project analyzes how the chosen plays establish links between present and former instances of repression, violence, and abuse--underscoring for audiences unaddressed haunting human rights concerns in late twentieth-century Argentina and Ireland.",1658775307,,Dissertations & Theses," Diaz, NoeliaDiazNoeliaDiaz, Noelia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3607633641 , 93808832 , 66569 , 9781321573381 , 3683261 , 3683261", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321573381, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1658775307?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0465 Theater , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0465 Theater , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0465 Theater , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0465 Theater , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Comparative literature , Latin American literature , Theater , British and Irish literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Communication and the arts , Aesthetics , Argentina , Arias, Lola , Bolger, Dermot , Cano, Luis , Carr, Marina , Daulte, Javier , Ireland , Irish theatre , Laragione, Lucia , McDonough, Martin , Neoliberalism , Postmodernism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Neoliberal+Dystopias%3A+Postmodern+Aesthetics+and+a+Modern+Ethic+in+Four+Pairs+of+Plays+by+Argentine+and+Irish+Playwrights+%281990%E2%80%932003%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Diaz%2C+Noelia&amp;isbn=9781321573381&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Producing Islam: &lt;i&gt;Da'wa&lt;/i&gt; and television in the ""New Egypt""","This dissertation is an ethnography of how new ways of being Islamic become possible and compelling through transnational media technologies, the globalized media cultures they enable, and their attendant sensory politics. It asks what does it mean to ""produce Islam""—both as a media form and in the broader social sense—through exploring the intersections of satellite television and religion in Egypt. Iqraa, the world's first self-declared Islamic television channel, was launched in 1998. Since then, the Islamic satellite sector has increased dramatically with dozens of channels competing for viewers across the Middle East and beyond. Iqraa, however, stands out for first producing the controversial programs of Egypt's ""New Preachers"" ( al-du'ah al-gudud ), so named because their styles of performance and media aesthetics are unprecedented within the country's piety movement. The forms of religious media created by the New Preachers and their affiliated television producers straddle distinct standards of moral probity, commercial success, and sensuous pleasure. Drawing on 31 months of fieldwork in Cairo with Iqraa producers and viewers, this study tracks how Islamic television has become a key site of struggle over religious authority, moral distinction, and cultural authenticity within the country's long-standing Islamic Revival. I argue that at stake in these internal contestations is not just the creation of novel forms of religious media, but also alternative imaginations of what religiosity entails, how it should be cultivated, and to what collective ends. Examining the intersections of Islam and televisual media in a revolutionary context troubles the utility of a secular-religious binary for understanding both the country's turbulent trajectory since the 2011 uprising and the struggles of Islamic Revivalists to create the ""New Egypt.""",1666862623,,Dissertations & Theses," Moll, YasminMollYasminMoll, Yasmin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3636478071 , 94994182 , 66569 , 9781321624366 , 3685892 , 3685892", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321624366, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1666862623?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0459 Communication , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Communication , Middle Eastern Studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Egypt , Islam , Media , Preaching , Religion , Television",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Producing+Islam%3A+Da%27wa+and+television+in+the%0A%22New+Egypt%22&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Moll%2C+Yasmin&amp;isbn=9781321624366&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The making of mass society in Shanghai: The socialist transformation of everyday life, 1949-1958","This study seeks to explain the emergence and ascendance of mass society in China through an investigation of everyday life in Shanghai across three turbulent decades. From the possibilities opened up by Jazz Age consumer culture in the early 1930s to the wholesale restructuring of work and culture under the Chinese Communist Party in the 1950s, the advent of mass society was centrally implicated in — and ultimately provided the resolution of — the long crisis of depression and war in China. By integrating large groups of people who had been marginalized, both socially and economically, into the industrial economy and a new culture of the masses, Communist Party rule after 1949 rapidly gained legitimacy and revived economic growth. Yet the process of integration into mass society also planted the seeds of future crises, as mass society's aesthetic of homogenization and standardization developed in tension with the occupational differentiation and regimentation required by the Party's developmental vision. Bringing together the methods of economic and cultural history, this dissertation explores the Party's vision of social transformation and how it was implemented on the complex social landscape of China's most important center of production, the city of Shanghai. I argue that to understand the 1950s, historians must move beyond an emphasis on the Communist Party's use of propaganda and repression. Mass society was not simply imposed by a domineering state upon a reluctant society, but emerged from a tangle of competing desires that were themselves reshaped through the encounter — converging around an increasingly standardized set of expectations and aspirations. The Party appealed to the powerful popular memory of the dysfunctional ""old society"" and offered in its stead a ""beautiful future"" that would be well-ordered and equitable, but which could only be reached through submission to the collective and to the imperative of expanding production. The possibility of such a future was rendered plausible at the grassroots not primarily by Party propaganda, but by a direct experience of the concrete material traces of mass society. Through a close examination of new work routines and forms of participation in the factories, popular involvement in new political ceremonies, and everyday conditions of residential life, this study shows how material practices, more than abstract ideology, gave form to mass society. I argue that this dynamic was not unique to Mao's China but part of a movement toward bureaucratizing economies and homogenizing cultures across the postwar world. China during the Mao period has often been cast as outside the movement of global history. This dissertation aims to restore China to its global context by identifying a convergence at the level of everyday life on both sides of the Cold War divide. ""Rationalization"" — of the production process and culture alike — was the watchword of the age, animating a worldwide pursuit of standardized mass production, technocratic economic administration, and a form of social inclusion premised on cultural conformity. The realization of these social forms was particularly pronounced in the People's Republic of China, throwing into relief the curious dual nature of ""the masses"" — at once an object of Party administration and an active political subject compelling the Party to repeatedly adjust its policy. The tensions embedded in the masses as a concept and as a practice suggest a new approach to the question of modernity in China. While the Mao period is often cast as a detour in the course of Chinese history, it is precisely the dynamic of reversal and reconstitution of the antinomies of modernity that most clearly marks twentieth century China as modern.",1667735313,,Dissertations & Theses," Werner, JakeWernerJakeWerner, Jake",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3640619011 , 95089532 , 66569 , 9781321645873 , 3687179 , 3687179", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321645873, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1667735313?accountid=14496," 0332 History , 0629 Labor relations , 0999 Urban planning"," 0332 History , 0629 Labor relations , 0999 Urban planning"," 0332 History , 0629 Labor relations , 0999 Urban planning",," 0332 History , 0629 Labor relations , 0999 Urban planning"," History , Labor relations , Urban planning"," Social sciences , China , Chinese Communist Party , Mao , Socialism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+making+of+mass+society+in+Shanghai%3A+The+socialist+transformation+of+everyday+life%2C+1949-1958&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Werner%2C+Jake&amp;isbn=9781321645873&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Internationalization Policy at the &lt;i&gt;Genba&lt;/i&gt;: Exploring the Implementation of Social Science English-Taught Undergraduate Degree Programs in Three Japanese Universities,"This study explored the implementation of social science English-taught undergraduate degree programs in Japanese universities and investigated the challenges they face. As higher education institutions in Japan seek to become more competitive, many institutions are introducing undergraduate degrees taught exclusively through the English language. Existing research in non-Anglophone countries has shown that programs differ in their rationales for implementation and in their design and characteristics, and therefore, experience different types of implementation challenges that inspire varied responses. However, in Japan, studies in the English language focusing on the implementation of English as a medium of instruction in higher education are few and concern only short-term and graduate programs. This study used a qualitative multiple-case study design to examine four-year social science undergraduate programs at three universities from the perspectives of those involved with the implementation process. Data were generated via 27 interviews with senior administrators, faculty members and international education support staff. The results indicate that the rationales for implementing the programs at the case-study institutions are grounded in a desire to increase competitiveness, with a focus on developing the international competencies of domestic Japanese students. Program design is oriented towards international and Japanese students in the same classrooms and is influenced by the understandings of key program implementers. Structural challenges were found to be the most significant obstacles to program implementation. In particular, institutions struggle with issues relating to program coherence and expansion, student recruitment and program identity. Structural challenges are so prominent that the study proposes a new typology of challenges facing the implementation of English-taught programs in Japan. This typology includes challenges related to the constructed understandings of the programs as institutions within the university. Practical responses to the challenges consist of discrete actions with little movement made that affects the university more broadly. Five salient elements that play an important role in the implementation of all of the case-study programs were also identified. These comprise the presence of committed leadership, implementer orientation regarding the English language, the position of the program within its institution, student recruitment, and the clarification of outcomes and goals.",1668131342,,Dissertations & Theses," Bradford, AnnetteBradfordAnnetteBradford, Annette",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3642229301 , 95119422 , 66569 , 9781321651188 , 3687531 , 3687531", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321651188, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1668131342?accountid=14496," 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy , 0745 Higher education"," 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy , 0745 Higher education"," 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy , 0745 Higher education",," 0446 Higher Education Administration , 0455 Multicultural Education , 0458 Education Policy , 0745 Higher education"," Higher Education Administration , Multicultural Education , Education Policy , Higher education"," Education , English medium instruction , International students , Internationalization of higher education , Japan , Program implementation , Student mobility",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Internationalization+Policy+at+the+Genba%3A+Exploring+the+Implementation+of+Social+Science+English-Taught+Undergraduate+Degree+Programs+in+Three+Japanese+Universities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bradford%2C+Annette&amp;isbn=9781321651188&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (pcbs) on the environment and the cultural integrity of the st. regis mohawk tribe in the mohawk nation of akwesasne,"The following research project examines the effects of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) on the environment and the cultural integrity of the St. Regis Mohawk tribe in the Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne. This indigenous community has been subjected to widespread long-term industrial pollution from nearby toxic hazardous waste facilities and Superfund sites. The Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne has the distinction of being the only tribe whose officially recognized territory straddles the border between the United States and Canada. Using qualitative methodologies, coupled with an interdisciplinary framework, this study successfully engages with Akwesasne community members to explore such issues as bottom-up approaches to addressing complex environmental issues, by gaining a comprehensive understanding of organizational structures and tribal governance networks. This study also identifies a clear parallel between the Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne's struggles and history of environmental justice efforts in the U.S. by articulating the effects of environmental degradation on their cultural integrity, in addition to surfacing themes of resistance and resilience in the community as building blocks for future action. The research project focuses on the place of the community's voice in the transnational public policy response to PCB contamination in the Mohawk Nation of Akwesasne. Three case studies were conducted in environmental organizations on the Mohawk Nation territory: the St. Regis Mohawk Tribe Environment Division, the Mohawk Council of Akwesasne, and the Akwesasne Task Force on the Environment. These environmental organizations have been working to protect the environment for approximately three decades. A case study analysis relies on data collected from interviews with staff members to determine how they organized themselves to address the environmental and social disruption caused by exposure to harmful chemical pollutants. Strong parallels can be drawn as a result of an analysis of environmental justice literature, since native communities have not, traditionally, been included in the scholarly academic literature on the Environmental Justice Movement in the United States. In addition to information gathered from institutional policy actors and related stakeholders, in-depth interviews with community members revealed a community framework for future policy development and action. Finally, the research focuses on how those community voices articulate the impacts of PCB contamination on the natural resources in the area, and as a result, on the ability of the St. Regis Mohawk tribe to maintain their culture, heritage, ceremonies, and traditional way of life.",1675961551,,Dissertations & Theses," McRae, KimMcRaeKimMcRae, Kim",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3666640061 , 95659992 , 66569 , 9781321682557 , 3689160 , 3689160", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321682557, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1675961551?accountid=14496," 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0740 Native American studies"," 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0740 Native American studies"," 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0740 Native American studies",," 0528 Natural Resource Management , 0619 Environmental Justice , 0740 Native American studies"," Natural Resource Management , Environmental Justice , Native American studies"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Akwesasne , Biphenyls , Cultural , Integrity , Mohawk , Nation , Pcbs , Polychlorinated , Regis , Tribe",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Effects+of+polychlorinated+biphenyls+%28pcbs%29+on+the+environment+and+the+cultural+integrity+of+the+st.+regis+mohawk+tribe+in+the+mohawk+nation+of+akwesasne&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McRae%2C+Kim&amp;isbn=9781321682557&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Dal cibo nazionale al cibo globale la digestione letteraria di un pasto storico,"In this thesis I explore the evolution of Italian culinary identity from the period of Italy’s unification to the present. In order to investigate this topic I use a multidisciplinary approach, drawing from historical, anthropological, and literary theory. I identify the social and political factors that have contributed to the construction of Italian food identity, thus creating over time, both in Italy and around the world, a myth of Italian food associated with purity, simplicity, local delicacies, tradition, and family. This thesis is divided into two major sections. In the first section, through an analysis of selected literary texts, I explore the role of food in important historical periods: Italian unification, futurism, fascism, the post WWII economic boom, and internal immigration beginning in the mid 1980s. I use a literary approach because fictional works provide insight into sentiments, atmospheres, and attitudes surrounding food culture that history is often unable to capture. Also, I demonstrate the ways in which these literary texts not only represent Italian food culture but also contribute to its construction. Finally, in the second and much briefer section, I explore the ways in which the formation of Italian food culture as evidenced by my historical and literary analysis has laid the foundation for the social and political organization Slow Food which embodies and promotes the virtues of the “traditional” Italian way of eating (local, natural, pure foods) as a solution to current social and environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture. I maintain that while Slow Food is often too idealistic and not practical enough to offer any singular solution to the global environmental crisis, the movement has been fundamental in promoting dialogue concerning this crisis.",1679953465,,Dissertations & Theses," Grose, Madeleine M.GroseM.MadeleineGrose, Madeleine M.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3680532341 , 95976752 , 66569 , 9781321712155 , 1587406 , 1587406", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321712155, Italian, Italian,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1679953465?accountid=14496," 0313 Romance literature , 0440 European Studies"," 0313 Romance literature , 0440 European Studies"," 0313 Romance literature , 0440 European Studies",," 0313 Romance literature , 0440 European Studies"," Romance literature , European Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Food , Italian food culture , Italian food history , Myth , Petrini, Carlo , Slow food",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Dal+cibo+nazionale+al+cibo+globale+la+digestione+letteraria+di+un+pasto+storico&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Grose%2C+Madeleine+M.&amp;isbn=9781321712155&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Performing Thirunangai: Activism, development, and normative citizenship in Tamil transgender performances","This dissertation examines how Thirunangais—members of Tamil Nadu's largest transgender population—use performance art to strengthen their social movement and, more broadly, redefine expectations of normative citizenship. In the past decade, Thirunangai activism has evolved from demands for basic rights and legal recognitions to more nuanced efforts at crafting a political and socioeconomic presence in contemporary Tamil Nadu. In the process, performance has been a primary vehicle through which community leaders articulate varied, sometimes competing visions of Thirunangai advancement. By exploring Thirunangai-generated performed representations in dance venues, filmed interviews, autobiographical films, and a popular transgender beauty pageant, this ethnographic study positions performance art as more than a tool of mobilization or a means of publicly negotiating local and global regimes of normativity. Instead, the dissertation examines the potentiality of performance as an embodied epistemology, capable of accumulating, storing, and transferring knowledge about Thirunangai politics, identity, and varied aspirations of socioeconomic development.",1680834346,,Dissertations & Theses," Samuel, Aaron TheodoreSamuelTheodoreAaronSamuel, Aaron Theodore",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3684525291 , 96072082 , 66569 , 9781321713091 , 3700994 , 3700994", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321713091, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1680834346?accountid=14496," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0492 GLBT Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0641 Performing Arts"," GLBT Studies , South Asian Studies , Performing Arts"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Activism , Aravani , Performance , Tamil Nadu , Thirunangai , Transgender",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Performing+Thirunangai%3A+Activism%2C+development%2C+and+normative+citizenship+in+Tamil+transgender+performances&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Samuel%2C+Aaron+Theodore&amp;isbn=9781321713091&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Negotiating Mine Fields: Public Policy, Protest and the Proposed Penokee Mine","Civil discourse is considered critical to democratic governance. Public perceptions of what that discourse entails — including a demand for a seat at the table — and the reality of what political elites and governments want from the public in the development and practice of public policy — the registering of an opinion—often conflict. Research suggests the conflict over unpopular government policy and the sense of disempowerment and disillusion in the public process often lead to apathy and a decline in public participation. Yet, in spite of a lack of sympathetic or even fair mainstream discourse, in other cases the public engages in sustained letter-writing and lobbying efforts, direct action and civil disobedience, leading to successful social movements. Using archival and historical review, content analysis of traditional and social media, interviews, and participant observation, this qualitative research explored the communications arena surrounding the attempts to site three different controversial mines in Wisconsin over the last 40 years to understand what moves people from apathy to protest and from protest to social movement. Complicating this issue in Wisconsin are treaty rights held by the Lake Superior Chippewa (Ojibwe) to hunt, fish and gather on public lands and waterways in the northern third of the state. With increasing global population, resource conflicts become more prevalent as extraction projects encroach on environmentally and culturally sensitive areas, leading to sustained conflicts and litigation. This research finds that historical precedent, past natural resource conflicts, and strong place-based identity prime communications about these conflicts and help structure a cultural sense of the worthiness of a struggle, but it is framing that shapes the perceptions of a civil taking via procedural, structural and environmental injustices that drives opposition to the streets. Predictive features include the perception of a powerful agent knowingly and even intentionally causing a perceived harm to citizens who have played by the rules. There must be concrete, broadly understood examples of perceived breaches of the social contract that erode trust in the agent, especially when that agent is representative government. The agent must be a clear perpetrator of the injustice, acting with perceived impunity, with identifiable victims with whom the public can empathize. Most critically, the victims must be deemed “worthy” of the moral outrage of those seeing the injustice, by following all the rules and having built up a history of struggle in the equivalent of the David vs. Goliath battle; and there must be a sense of efficacy based on a clear moral high ground to set the stage for hot button injustice frames.",1680841295,,Dissertations & Theses," Turville-Heitz, Margaret E.

These evangelical environmentalists are divided into two camps: the wise-use evangelicals, who believe that humankind should have dominion over creation and take a more economic perspective on environmentalism; and the creation care evangelicals, who believe humans are stewards of creation and take a more ecological approach to environmentalism. The dialogue between these two groups is a rich rhetorical space in which to analyze identity and authority because of the populist, independent, and non-hierarchical nature of evangelicalism and because evangelical identity is often regulated through both political and religious beliefs. Not only are evangelical environmentalists centering new issues, but they are working to redefine what it means to be evangelical, which will be key in understanding the future trajectory of American evangelicalism. This project challenges the scholarly and popular narratives of American evangelicalism while encouraging a broader and more nuanced view of the influence of religious traditions on political and social ideas. It tracks the rhetorical patterns and processes used to build an authoritative evangelical environmental message and create a unique evangelical environmental ethic. It is a study of the interaction and mutual influence of public identities, one religious and the other political. This project explores the three primary legacies of evangelical environmentalism: (1) the normalization of environmental concepts, rhetoric, and action within evangelicalism, (2) the construction of an evangelical environmental theology based in hope, sustainability, and international justice, and (3) the re-definition of ""pro-life"" as a marker of American evangelical identity. Through a historical, rhetorical, and frame analysis of evangelical environmental campaigns, primary literature, and educational materials, this project challenges the previous political perceptions of evangelicalism and environmentalism in order to reveal new understandings of the creation and maintenance of authority and religious identity in the public sphere.",1681025115,,Dissertations & Theses," Burch, Kate NetzlerBurchNetzlerKateBurch, Kate Netzler",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3685632641 , 96098402 , 66569 , 9781321728903 , 3701951 , 3701951", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321728903, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1681025115?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0477 Environmental Studies",," 0318 Religion , 0320 Religious history , 0477 Environmental Studies"," Religion , Religious history , Environmental Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Health and environmental sciences , Creation care , Environmentalism , Evangelical , Identity , Pro-life , Religion and politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Creation+care%3A+Evangelicals%2C+politics%2C+and+the+environment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Burch%2C+Kate+Netzler&amp;isbn=9781321728903&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Genetic dissection of an invasive hybrid swarm,"Biological invasions are a global threat to aquatic biodiversity. Of particular concern are invasive freshwater fishes because they have high establishment rates, and introductions can result in the displacement and extirpation of native species through a range of processes including competition and hybridization. Though it is well known that invasive freshwater fishes commonly spread following introduction events, little is known about how fast and far they may move. Additionally, observations of hybridization involving invasive stream fishes have been linked to elevated turbidity; however, the extent to which impaired water clarity influences reproductive isolation among invasive and native species remains poorly understood. To better understand how invasive freshwater fishes disperse, and how turbidity affects reproductive isolation between native and non-native species, I carried out a series of three related studies. First, I evaluated genetic variation across the native and invasive ranges of red shiner ( Cyprinella lutrensis ), throughout the United States. Second, I characterized genetic variation and clinal stability across a hybrid swarm involving native blacktail shiner ( Cyprinella venusta stigmatura ) and invasive red shiner in the Upper Coosa River Basin (UCRB), USA. Third, I examined whether turbidity influences pre-mating social interactions between invasive red shiner and native blacktail shiner. MtDNA haplotypes from native range populations of red shiner form four divergent lineages and suggest that introduced populations in the western and eastern US originate from dissimilar genetic lineages. I also recovered a previously undescribed lineage of Cyprinella that has been cryptically introduced into the western US. Examination of the hybrid swarm in the UCRB revealed that the proportion of hybrids increased between 2005 and 2011, and that the hybrid swarm is continuing to expand both upstream and downstream. Under turbid conditions, I found that pre-mating social interactions increased, and that native blacktail shiner females are especially likely to interact with invasive red shiner males. Localized control or removal may be effective in managing non-native red shiner; further monitoring, however, is needed to help identify additional factors contributing to hybrid swarm movement. Furthermore, integrating knowledge of species behavior into management planning could help deter the further establishment and spread of invasive red shiner.",1688680287,,Dissertations & Theses," Glotzbecker, Gregory JohnGlotzbeckerJohnGregoryGlotzbecker, Gregory John",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3716553151 , 96905522 , 66569 , 9781321751864 , 3703389 , 3703389", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321751864, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1688680287?accountid=14496," 0329 Ecology , 0412 Evolution and Development"," 0329 Ecology , 0412 Evolution and Development"," 0329 Ecology , 0412 Evolution and Development",," 0329 Ecology , 0412 Evolution and Development"," Ecology , Evolution and Development"," Biological sciences , Biological invasions , Cyprinella , Hybrid zones , Hybridization , Red shiner , Turbidity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Genetic+dissection+of+an+invasive+hybrid+swarm&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Glotzbecker%2C+Gregory+John&amp;isbn=9781321751864&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Crabgrass piety: The rise of megachurches and the suburban social religion, 1960-2000","Although there were less than twenty megachurches (churches averaging over two thousand in weekly attendance) in the United States before 1960, by 2010 there were approximately fifteen hundred. Megachurches are not a homogenous group, but they exist in all parts of the country and they have enough in common to warrant their identification as part of a coherent trend in American evangelical culture. Specifically, most megachurches appeal to an ethos that emerged in the 1970s and 1980s known as the suburban social religion. The suburban social religion combined to differing degrees the American civil religion described by Robert Bellah, meritocratic consumerism, the Therapeutic Moralistic Deism described by Christian Smith, and a faith in managerial science. With respect to church structure, the suburban social religion placed a high value on running the church as a business and giving worshippers what they wanted. These values meshed well with those of the Church Growth Movement. The suburban social religion helped engender the celebration and emulation of entrepreneurial pastors, entertaining worship services, and therapeutic messages. It also fit well with the center-right political discourse of the national Republican Party. Megachurch growth provoked a number of critics, who in the early 1990s severely chastised large churches for catering to consumerism. Finally, American megachurches connected with large churches in other parts of the world. These large churches in many cases predate the rise of American megachurches, and have become important centers in an emerging global evangelical megachurch culture. Although new megachurches will continue to appear, and existing ones will remain strong for many years to come, they have not managed to arrest the secularization of American society. Megachurches are in fact a prime example of the church's loss of influence over other social spheres. Furthermore, in most communities megachurches have failed to stop the overall decline of religious adherence rates among Protestants. They have nevertheless become the most visible evangelical cultural institutions in most metropolitan areas. An understanding of megachurches therefore deepens an understanding of how American communities have changed more generally since 1970.",1690276245,,Dissertations & Theses," Saunders, Nathan JosephSaundersJosephNathanSaunders, Nathan Joseph",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3722417501 , 96643032 , 66569 , 9781321767711 , 3704397 , 3704397", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321767711, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1690276245?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0647 Spirituality"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0647 Spirituality"," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0647 Spirituality",," 0320 Religious history , 0337 American history , 0647 Spirituality"," Religious history , American history , Spirituality"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Consumerism , Megachurch , Religion , Secularization , Suburbs",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Crabgrass+piety%3A+The+rise+of+megachurches+and+the+suburban+social+religion%2C+1960-2000&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Saunders%2C+Nathan+Joseph&amp;isbn=9781321767711&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Human Rights and the Warming World: Knowing Climate Change as a Socio-Legal Problem,"This dissertation examines attempts at the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights (IACHR) and the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) to use human rights law to incite more ambitious action on global warming. Drawing on science and technology studies (STS), the sociology of law, and research on social movements, I argue that such efforts should be conceived as not only framing but also knowing climate change as a socio-legal problem. The IACHR and the UNHRC each outline a precise set of evidentiary requirements necessary to know that a human rights violation has occurred. Substantiating global warming's human rights impact requires that advocates marshal data to meet each arena's demands. Whereas the dominant natural scientific version of climate change relies heavily on natural science, the human rights frame rests on social knowledge. Through content analysis, interviews with key actors, and two weeks of participant observation at a United Nations climate summit, I identified the range of social knowledge claims and practices that advocates use to support their allegations. This analysis contributes to recent efforts to extend classic STS perspectives to the realm of social knowledge, in this case by deepening our understanding of the production of legal knowledge. Specifically, it highlights the role of performance and negotiation in the production of legal knowledge and further underscores the significance of place. Each arena's evidentiary requirements, rules of procedure, norms, and technologies shape how advocates formulate and authenticate their claims, molding the resultant knowledge. Those same site-specific factors that mediate the production of legal knowledge also shape the practice by which advocates translate political claims into legal claims, thus shaping the substance of their demands. Analyzing efforts to advance a human rights approach to climate change also shows that the human rights frame functions as much as an organizational as a moral resource, and it shows how a social movement's failure to achieve its instrumental aims shapes how we conceive of human rights. In addition, tracing the development of the human rights frame sheds light on framing dynamics by illustrating how an institutional arena's communication infrastructure and norms impact a frame's diffusion.",1690881940,,Dissertations & Theses," Koski, Jessica PowersKoskiPowersJessicaKoski, Jessica Powers",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3724722901 , 97104892 , 66569 , 9781321782004 , 3705296 , 3705296", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321782004, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1690881940?accountid=14496," 0398 Law , 0404 Climate Change , 0700 Social structure"," 0398 Law , 0404 Climate Change , 0700 Social structure"," 0398 Law , 0404 Climate Change , 0700 Social structure",," 0398 Law , 0404 Climate Change , 0700 Social structure"," Law , Climate Change , Social structure"," Social sciences , Earth sciences , Climate change , Human rights , Knowledge production , Law , Science and technology studies",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Human+Rights+and+the+Warming+World%3A+Knowing+Climate+Change+as+a+Socio-Legal+Problem&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Koski%2C+Jessica+Powers&amp;isbn=9781321782004&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Mexican Revolution: Leonor Villegas de Magnón and the binational battle for women's equality,"Leonor Villegas de Magnón and her medical corps, La Cruz Blanca, fill an important void in Mexican and Mexican-American women’s history as well as the Mexican Revolution.

The study's impetus is current characterizations of Tambaram as the pinnacle of a church-centric mission theology portrayed as primarily concerned with the numerical growth of the church as an institution under particular cultural norms rather than as an emphasis on the church as the primary agent in mission with growth of the church as a result of mission, rather than the primary aim or goal. The misrepresentation of Tambaram and its church-centrism plays out in the origin story of today's missional ecclesiology movement and also is subscribed to by other proponents of missio Dei mission theology. These groups differentiate themselves from church-centrism by way of theo-centrism—espousing a trinitarian foundation for mission in the missionary nature and activity of God. Historical analysis identifies the contextual factors contributing to Tambaram's turn to the church, the core features of Tambaram's ecclesiology, and the major dissent from Tambaram's affirmation of the church. Further analysis places Tambaram in historical relation to the IMC's Jerusalem meeting in 1928 and pre-IMC modern Protestant mission history in terms of contention over the kingdom of God concept. This analysis of Tambaram is then applied to current characterizations of church-centrism clarifying Tambaram's relation to later developments in conciliar Protestant mission history and Tambaram's (non)reception. Four contextual factors influenced Tambaram's turn to the church and also affected the content of their affirmation of the church: a pattern of growing internationalization and parity in the history of the IMC; geo-political tensions and the threat of war; late-modern socio-cultural changes and the totalitarian claims of secular ideologies, nationalism, and non-Christian religions; and an ecclesiological turn in international Protestantism, especially the 1937 meetings of the Life and Work and Faith and Order movements. Five salient characteristics of Tambaram's latent ecclesiology are identified from textual analysis: penitence, the church called with a purpose, the witness-bearing nature of the church, community and fellowship, and the social and cultural contextualization of indigenous local churches. The study then compares these results with current historical representations and concludes that Tambaram and church-centric mission theology are caricatured. The caricature is rejected, thereby closing off Tambaram from current conversations regarding ecclesiology, culture, and mission. In particular, this caricature and rejection anchors one of the two tributary streams missional ecclesiology narrates in its origin story.

The dissertation traces Ainu historical engagement with the Japanese, starting with the Jomon Neolithic period through successive stages of trade, colonization, and assimilation. By tracing these periods of engagement, we can observe how cross-cultural influences have affected the tonkori and its tradition, and how subjugation practices from colonization led to the rise of Ainu social movements and the reconstruction of a new performing arts genre with the tonkori as its main instrument. The dissertation presents Ainu performing arts as a contemporary phenomenon, one that is being newly created and currently in a transformative process, initiated by key musicians who are also cultural and political leaders. The tonkori is emblematic as a musical instrument that allows its practitioners to convey a distinct Ainu indigeneity within Japanese society, a notion that challenges accepted beliefs in Japan of a homogeneous ethnic identity. This work addresses the roles of individual musicians within the Ainu social movement as mediators engaging with Japanese and international institutions and also as bearers of a newly emerging musical tradition.",1701284743,,Dissertations & Theses," Uyeda, KumikoUyedaKumikoUyeda, Kumiko",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3767934431 , 95736682 , 66569 , 9781321933727 , 3715286 , 3715286", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321933727, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1701284743?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0413 Music"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0413 Music",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0342 Asian Studies , 0413 Music"," Cultural anthropology , Asian Studies , Music"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Ainu , Cultural revival , Indigeneity , Japan , Minoritization , Tonkori",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+journey+of+the+tonkori%3A+A+multicultural+transmission&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Uyeda%2C+Kumiko&amp;isbn=9781321933727&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Collective sensing and information transfer in animal groups,"This dissertation addresses several topics in collective motion in animal groups. Coordination among social animals often requires rapid and efficient transfer of information among individuals, which may depend crucially on the underlying structure of the interaction network used for communication. In two experimental systems and in one simulation study, we study the nature of interactions and interaction networks, and how these interactions scale up to global order in the system. The resulting collective properties allow animal groups access to ""collective computation"" such that they can process and respond to stimuli in ways in which a single individual cannot. First, we study collective evasion maneuvers, manifested through rapid cascades of behavioral change (a ubiquitous behavior among taxa), in schooling fish (Notemigonus crysoleucas). We determine the functional mapping between socially generated sensory input and motor response during collective evasion. We find that individuals employ simple, robust measures to assess behavioral changes in neighbors, and that the resulting networks by which behavior propagates are complex; being weighted and directed. By studying these interaction networks, we reveal the (complex, fractional) nature of social contagion, and establish that individuals with relatively few, but strongly-connected, neighbors are both most socially influential, and most susceptible to influence. Next, we study the relationship between emergent periodic synchronization in ant colonies, and interactions between ants in different behavioral states. We investigate the factors driving fluctuations in the overall level of synchronization observed in the colony, and find that flexible behavioral responses to interactions can explain these fluctuations, in both real data and in a simulated ant colony. Finally, we model collective movement, motivated by experimental data, demonstrating that simple behavioral rules can allow groups to maximize performance in dynamical search tasks. Additionally, the behaviors that optimize performance place the population near a transitional regime. Individuals locate and track dynamic resources by splitting and fusing to form groups that match the length scale of these resources. This occurs even when individuals cannot evaluate resource sizes or determine the sizes of groups to which they belong. Our model demonstrates that fission-fusion dynamics can allow social animals to balance the exploration-exploitation tradeoff.",1707358207,,Dissertations & Theses," Rosenthal, Sara BrintonRosenthalBrintonSaraRosenthal, Sara Brinton",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3788652571 , 94329752 , 66569 , 9781321882704 , 3711831 , 3711831", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321882704, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1707358207?accountid=14496, 0786 Biophysics, 0786 Biophysics, 0786 Biophysics,, 0786 Biophysics, Biophysics," Biological sciences , Animal groups , Collective sensing , Information transfer",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Collective+sensing+and+information+transfer+in+animal+groups&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Rosenthal%2C+Sara+Brinton&amp;isbn=9781321882704&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Talking points: American dialogue in the twentieth century,"Talking Points offers a new theoretical and historical account of the novelistic representation of colloquial speech throughout American modernism. Through mimetic representations of everyday speech, American modernist novels assign a deeply political valence to popular, technical, or even trivial forms of dialogue, as they assert their vexed cultural authority on matters of race, gender, psychology, and social practice. My project moves the study of dialogue in American literature beyond the dominant critical association with social dialects that began with the work of Mikhail Bakhtin. Talking Points examines four types of dialogue: straight talk, small talk, cross talk, and smooth talk. My project begins with an account of the effects of straight talk on the American novel of manners and traces how Henry James and Edith Wharton experiment with straight talk to provide an expanded theory of adolescent subjectivity. Conduct manuals and elocution classes explode in the early twentieth century, providing a cultural context for the passing narratives of James Weldon Johnson and Nella Larsen. My work on these authors reverses the critical tendency to equate passing with self-denial, instead arguing that Johnson and Larsen convert small talk into an equivocal medium for passing that, paradoxically, makes audible a protest against legal segregation and speech regulation. A third chapter on William Faulkner concerns radio technology, which prompted his experiment with cross talk, a term born from radio interference, as a modernist aesthetic practice and screenwriting technique. Cross talk marks the limits of understanding as technology widens Faulkner's social world and as cultural anxieties over racial difference become central to his novels. From Faulkner, my project turns to the phenomenon of smooth talk that emerges in connection with jazz innovations in novels by James Baldwin and Toni Morrison. These writers transform smooth talk into a style of public intellectualism in the late century, charming transnational and multiracial audiences to gain broad support for civil rights initiatives and wide recognition of historic racial traumas. By recuperating the crucial role of minor modernist dialogues, Talking Points maps the aesthetic improvisations and cultural ambivalences that shaped many of the twentieth century's most significant social movements.",1707681209,,Dissertations & Theses," Krumholtz, MatthewKrumholtzMatthewKrumholtz, Matthew",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3790066531 , 98631532 , 66569 , 9781321894707 , 3712558 , 3712558", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321894707, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1707681209?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies"," 0296 African American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies",," 0296 African American Studies , 0591 American literature , 0733 Gender studies"," African American Studies , American literature , Gender studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Colloquial speech , Dialogue , Twentieth century",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Talking+points%3A+American+dialogue+in+the+twentieth+century&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Krumholtz%2C+Matthew&amp;isbn=9781321894707&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Anthropology, advocacy, and electric vehicles","In this thesis, I examine Sierra Club's Electric Vehicles Initiative (EV Initiative) as a case study for challenges to and strategies within the contemporary American environmental movement, based on observations I made during an internship with the EV Initiative from May through September 2014. Environmental advocacy groups are central forces in organizing public and political action that call for solutions to environmental problems, most notably global climate change. Despite political claims to the contrary, the scientific community has largely concurred that human activities are causing dangerous and rapid increases in the temperature of earth's atmosphere that already threaten public health, human rights, economic systems, and ecosystems worldwide. Environmental advocacy groups, like Sierra Club, are the collective organizations that unify and lead the members of the public who want to see solutions to problems like global climate change. They do so by educating the public about environmental problems and by lobbying for local, state, and federal policies that address them. In short, environmental advocacy groups are the primary spokespeople for environmental solutions in policy and public discourse. Despite this, few researchers have explored how environmental advocacy groups operate and what forces impact their day-to-day decisions and actions. Fewer researchers still have done so while working for the organizations, gaining an insider's unique perspective on the daily interplay between internal dynamics and external social, political, and economic forces. In this thesis I have attempted to do just that. Based on a critical analysis supported by anthropological methods, I evaluate my internship with Sierra Club's EV Initiative as a case study of how an environmental advocacy group negotiates internal and external challenges to address increasingly urgent global environmental threats.",1707866972,,Dissertations & Theses," Goldberg, Melissa J.GoldbergJ.MelissaGoldberg, Melissa J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3790953601 , 98566202 , 66569 , 9781321908923 , 1594136 , 1594136", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321908923, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1707866972?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0363 Alternative Energy , 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0363 Alternative Energy , 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0363 Alternative Energy , 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0363 Alternative Energy , 0404 Climate Change , 0477 Environmental Studies"," Cultural anthropology , Alternative Energy , Climate Change , Environmental Studies"," Social sciences , Applied sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Earth sciences , Applied anthropology , Electric vehicles , Environmental advocacy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Anthropology%2C+advocacy%2C+and+electric+vehicles&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Goldberg%2C+Melissa+J.&amp;isbn=9781321908923&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Competing constructivisms: Modern architecture and design in Japan and Korea, c. 1925-1940","This dissertation focuses on a set of dynamic Japanese and Korean architects and artists who, during the interwar period, actively adopted and transformed the principles of Russian Constructivism, the Bauhaus, and International Architecture into their own artistic style. This study provides the first comprehensive study of the multifaceted connections between Europe, Japan, and Korea to explore the richness of this relatively underrepresented, but decisive, modern aesthetic impulse. Prior to and during the period of the activities of the two major architectural groups in Japan, Bunriha Kenchikukai (1920-1928) and the Sōusha (1923-1932), Yamaguchi Bunzō (1902-1978), the leader of the Sōusha, demonstrated a strong commitment to Marxism and promoted gorishugi kenchiku (rationalist architecture), which acted on his vision of social transformation through a rationalist and functional approach to architectural design. In contrast, Yamawaki Iwao (1898-1987) enjoyed a rather socially neutral perspective of Constructivism and searched for a synthesis between the principles of the Bauhaus style and traditional Japanese interior designs of private houses. Furniture designer Kurata Chikatada (1895-1966), the leader of Keiji Kō¯bō (1928-1940), employed the idea of standardization derived from the Bauhaus workshops, and tried to find a way to mass-produce handcrafts. Whereas Yamaguchi, Yamawaki, and Kurata used Constructivism to open up a wide field of modernist opportunity and inventiveness, Korean architects and artists, who worked under circumstances defined mostly by the colonial status of the nation, embraced the international movement only in a rather informative and redemptive way—a ""local"" way to assert a suppressed national dynamism. The first generation of Korean architects, which included Park Gil-ryong (1898-1943) and Park Dong-jin (1899-1981), suggested a way to incorporate the qualities of Constructivist style into Korean homes. Korean artists Lee Sun-seok (1905-1986) and Yoo Youngkuk (1916-2002), who studied in Tokyo during the 1930s, adapted the Constructivist style to suit the local customs and artistic conventions of Korea after they returned to their homeland. This comparative study will provide new insights into the history of modern architecture and design in Japan and Korea and a reassessment of the significance of these architects and designers who, from the mid-1920s, contributed to make Constructivism internationally recognized.",1707902679,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, SuzieKimSuzieKim, Suzie",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3791044151 , 98599262 , 66569 , 9781321874075 , 3711271 , 3711271", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321874075, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1707902679?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," Asian Studies , Art history , Architecture"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Bauhaus , Constructivism , Modern architecture , Modern art , Modern japanese art , Modern korean art",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Competing+constructivisms%3A+Modern+architecture+and+design+in+Japan+and+Korea%2C+c.+1925-1940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Suzie&amp;isbn=9781321874075&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The struggle to restrict pesticide use: The confluence of social movements and a network of expertise,"In a time of growing technological hazards, there is widespread concern about the demise of citizen control over risk governance. As technological regulatory frameworks are based on experts' decisions, democratic debate is increasingly restricted or eliminated from the process. In this context, new forms of collective action in the arena of regulatory science (Jasanoff, 1990) are emerging, as well as novel relationships between social movements and scientific expertise. This dissertation seeks to understand these relationships by exploring the conflict over the governance of agrarian biotechnology in Argentina. I focus on campaigns for changing agricultural practices and restricting the use of pesticides in the province of Córdoba between 2001 and 2013. Argentina is the third largest producer of genetically modified (GM) soy. Since the 1996 domestic adoption of GM soy that is resistant to glyphosate based herbicides, the proportion of hectares under cultivation and the use of glyphosate have increased exponentially. While agrarian bio-technology has improved productivity levels; the concomitant human health and environmental costs associated with glyphosate-based herbicides use have generated intense protest in the affected agricultural communities. Most of these locally based protests were ignored by the government and dissipated without impacting glyphosate based herbicides usage. Despite the fact that experiments conducted by independent international scientists have revealed associations between glyphosate exposure and a range of health ailments (including cancer, miscarriages, birth defects, infertility, and delayed pregnancies), Argentina’s national regulatory agency classified glyphosate as a product of “low toxicity” and no national law restricting glyphosate based herbicides commercialization and use was ever passed in the country. However, some communities successfully challenged official regulatory science by creating enduring protest organizations allied with scientists and physicians, pressing for the enactment of local regulations that restricted the use of glyphosate based herbicides and mandated change in GM soy cultivation practices. This dissertation documents and analyzes the process through which grassroots movements promoted the emergence of a national network of expertise (Eyal 2010a, 2001b); and how the different but intertwined strategies pursued by the social movements and the emerging network of expertise resulted in positive changes within the science-based regulatory framework in Argentina.",1708927896,,Dissertations & Theses," Arancibia, FlorenciaArancibiaFlorenciaArancibia, Florencia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3795011721 , 98745902 , 66569 , 9781321936940 , 3715468 , 3715468", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321936940, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1708927896?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Counter-hegemonic science , Network of expertise , Pesticides and genetically modified crops , Risk governance , Social movements , Socio-environmental conflict",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+struggle+to+restrict+pesticide+use%3A+The+confluence+of+social+movements+and+a+network+of+expertise&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Arancibia%2C+Florencia&amp;isbn=9781321936940&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Boom and gloom: Comparing diverse development outcomes among oil- and mineral-dependent developing countries,"This dissertation examines the contrasting development outcomes among countries in the Global South that depend on revenue from oil and mineral exploitation. According to the conventional ""resource curse"" perspective, developing countries rich in oil and minerals paradoxically suffer from poverty and underdevelopment. However, a closer look at these economies reveals substantial variation in their levels of economic and social development. Drawing on theories of globalization, development, and political sociology, this dissertation addresses: Why do some oil- and mineral-dependent developing countries end up with relatively high levels of development while others remain underdeveloped? To answer this question, my research uses a multimethod research design involving three phases and both quantitative and qualitative methods. The first phase draws on evidence from quantitative cross-section time-series regression analysis using national development data on 26 oil- and mineral-dependent developing countries for the period from 1985 to 2010. For the second phase, I conduct an in-depth comparative-historical analysis of two similar oil-rich developing countries with divergent development outcomes—Trinidad and Tobago, and Gabon—using more than 100 national documents and secondary sources that I collected during 13 months of fieldwork. In the third phase, I conduct abbreviated case studies of three mineral-dependent developing countries—Guyana, Niger, and Zambia—using secondary data. My explanation for why some countries outperform others consists of two nested claims. First, I find that strong state institutions matter the most for economic and social development, but, unlike previous studies, I also show that the negative impacts of dependence on foreign direct investment and foreign debt on development cannot be ignored. Therefore, the divergence in outcomes among these countries depends on a particular constellation and intersection of local and global factors. Second, the construction of strong state institutions is not solely driven by the legacies of European colonial agents, as is often cited in existing literature, but rather, by the strength of local labor movements. My dissertation thus provides critical intervention into broader debates within the development literature about the relative roles of natural resources, domestic political conditions, and global economic structures in effecting development.",1709003604,,Dissertations & Theses," Edwards, ZophiaEdwardsZophiaEdwards, Zophia",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3795527711 , 98753932 , 66569 , 9781321925470 , 3714787 , 3714787", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321925470, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1709003604?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Developing countries , Economic development , Global south , Social development",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Boom+and+gloom%3A+Comparing+diverse+development+outcomes+among+oil-+and+mineral-dependent+developing+countries&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Edwards%2C+Zophia&amp;isbn=9781321925470&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Democratizing the City Through the Colonization of Public Space: A Case Studey of Portland Food Not Bombs,"The implementation of neoliberal economic and political policies is often touted as a way to increase overall individual well-being and freedom. While these policies may benefit those already wielding economic security and political power, marginalized populations often bear the negative cost associated with such policies. As deregulation and privatization increases, social safety nets and social spending are dramatically reduced. At the local level, liberalization has resulted in increased surveillance and regulation of public space. Organized resistance to global corporatization and increased economic and political marginalization has occurred across the globe. Resisting neoliberalism is complex as the adaptability of the state and capital requires an adaptive form of resistance. Portland Food Not Bombs provides an empirical example of an oppositional social movement organization that resists neoliberal logic and reclaims public space for collective use by serving free meals. This case study includes participant observation of both Portland FNB chapters conducted at chapter specific meal preparation and serving sites. It also includes ten interviews with individuals who are heavily involved with the SMO. Publicly available documents such as Facebook pages, chapter specific websites, and the FNB website provided important contextual information as well. This study finds that the organizational structure of Portland FNB lends itself to more democratic practices and ideals, coinciding with the values of the respondents.

Virally multiplied, witnessed, and repurposed on the Internet, DNIs are playing an increasingly key role in expressions of autonomous, personalized, and self-motivated civic engagement. As manifested in major social uprisings such as the Arab Spring and the Occupy Movement, global citizens increasingly use DNIs not only as a form of political expression but also as a pathway to imagined, post-national unities and online counterpublics operating outside dominate public discourses and/or geographic barriers. Providing critical analysis of contemporary social change mediated through DNIs, this study poses political and theoretical questions about the role of DNIs in effecting political change and causing the expansion of public awareness and subsequent action in response to sociopolitical events on an unprecedented scale. Combining semiotics, media theory, and cultural studies, the study applies an interdisciplinary framework to examine the power and impact of DNIs upon cross-cultural and cross-political life. Examining the participatory dimension of DNIs reveals that an image’s meaning is no longer contingent upon its indexicality or indexation alone, but rather is equally dependent on the fluidity of multiple and immediate textual narratives and visual derivatives that social media users disseminate in response to it. Expanding upon Barthes’ model for semiotic analysis, the study introduces the participatory narrative message as a way to examine the process of meaning formation in DNIs, which operate not in isolation but by and through continuous other mediated, citizen-produced byproducts surrounding them. Lastly, drawing on Foucauldian theories of sovereignty, social discipline, and governmentality, this study uncovers the implications of DNI usage in the perpetration of terror by militant and vigilante groups such as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or the Russian anti-gay group “Occupy Pedophilia.”",1712989196,,Dissertations & Theses," Kasra, MonaKasraMonaKasra, Mona",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3809909141 , 99072912 , 66569 , 9781321997262 , 3719388 , 3719388", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781321997262, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1712989196?accountid=14496, 0646 Web Studies, 0646 Web Studies, 0646 Web Studies,, 0646 Web Studies, Web Studies," Communication and the arts , Counterpublics , Digital image , Internet , Photography , Selfie , Social media",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+digital-networked+image%3A+Temporality+and+post-national+%23sociopoliticalexpression&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kasra%2C+Mona&amp;isbn=9781321997262&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Midwives and Madonnas: Motherhood and citizenship in the American counterculture,"This project examines how counterculture mothers reimagined female citizenship over three decades of protest and activism. Witnessing the restrictive social contract that bound their suburban mothers to Cold War policies, hippie women sought to dramatically redefine the obligations that structured motherhood. They utilized the experimental structure of communal societies to enact a variation of motherhood that encouraged the development of a highly individualized self, free from the oppressive social structures that shaped Cold War society. Hippie women viewed this elimination of oppressive social structures as a reclamation, rather than a departure from, American values. The collapse of communal societies and the broader crisis of American identity in the mid-1970s, however, prompted an evolution in counterculture motherhood and citizenship. Through the home birth movement, these women merged feminism, hippie values, and red power rhetoric to advocate for a variation of motherhood linked a mother’s powerful reproductive ability became to a broader obligation to protect the sovereignty of the earth. Counterculture women produced a global citizenship rooted in an individual connection to the earth and environmentalism, not merely the state. Their incorporation of feminism and liberal citizenship, however, accompanied the embrace of the nuclear family as well as a return to a social contract that equated biological motherhood to female fulfillment. Hippie women’s radical revisioning of motherhood cannot be placed on a liberal-conservative political spectrum; rather, it represents the complexity of identity and citizenship in the 1970s and early 1980s.",1716335520,,Dissertations & Theses," Blankenbaker, Kristen A.BlankenbakerA.KristenBlankenbaker, Kristen A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3818022171 , 98774742 , 66569 , 9781339009803 , 1597585 , 1597585", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339009803, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1716335520?accountid=14496," 0453 Womens studies , 0578 History"," 0453 Womens studies , 0578 History"," 0453 Womens studies , 0578 History",," 0453 Womens studies , 0578 History"," Womens studies , History"," Social sciences , America , Citizenship , Counterculture , Home birth movement , Midwifery , Motherhood",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Midwives+and+Madonnas%3A+Motherhood+and+citizenship+in+the+American+counterculture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Blankenbaker%2C+Kristen+A.&amp;isbn=9781339009803&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Mapping the Global Black South:&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Aesthetics, Labor, and Diaspora","Recent scholarship on black transnationalism and diaspora in the early twentieth century has largely focused on migration to the urban centers of the US North and Western Europe. “Mapping the Global Black South: Aesthetics, Labor, and Diaspora” revises this discourse by exploring the movement of people, cultural practices, and ideas between the US South and the Caribbean as an alternative network of African diasporic affiliation. According to Caribbean theorist Édouard Glissant, “the Plantation system” created a “rhythm of economic production” and a “style of life” that links the US South to the Caribbean and parts of Latin America. Building on Glissant’s geographic frame, this dissertation establishes the plantation—a fundamentally modern form of labor organization—as the figural and literal organizing principle of “the global black south”: a matrix of diasporic articulation, subject formation, and knowledge and cultural production. Through close readings of works by Booker T. Washington, Claude McKay, Zora Neale Hurston, and Jean Price-Mars, this study examines how African American and Caribbean writers and intellectuals mobilized aesthetics—literature, music, photographs, and performance—to imagine alternative futures within and against the legacy of the plantation. By drawing on theories of the plantation in Caribbean and New Southern Studies, “Mapping the Global Black South” makes critical interventions in the field of African American Studies, where the plantation is almost exclusively regarded as a metonym for slavery and anti-modernity. In Caribbean Studies, by contrast, scholars have proposed a more nuanced rendering of the plantation as the genesis of black modern life and culture, and in New Southern Studies, it has been reconceived as the link that tethers the US South to the global south (based on similar patterns of underdevelopment). Through an interdisciplinary and multimedia methodology, then, this study interrogates the paradox of the plantation as at once local and global, fecund and barren, static and fungible—as a site of agricultural production that animates the flow of global capital, on the one hand, and a modern technology of power that exploits the land and the bodies forced to work it, on the other. In so doing, it establishes the plantation as a matrix of global black south cultures that revises traditional understandings of black modernity and creates new systems of connectivity and legibility for contemporary scholarship. Moreover, in reconsidering the plantation as a crucible of black modernity, “Mapping the Global Black South” reconstructs the historical significance of the Tuskegee Institute—a former plantation turned industrial school—as a nodal point of black diasporic affiliation and a model for resolving one of the fundamental predicaments of New World blackness: the problem of free labor. Given that slavery was a system of coerced and exploitative labor, the greatest challenge of emancipation throughout the global black south was transforming a mass of formerly enslaved persons into autonomous workers. Thus, by the turn of the twentieth century, black artists and intellectuals from across the region began to embrace (and adapt) Booker T. Washington’s vision of an agrarian and industrial future (by way of Tuskegee) as a strategy for racial uplift and self-determination. Whereas Washington’s reformism is commonly reduced to a foil for W.E.B. Du Bois’ radicalism, this dissertation resituates Washington within a hemispheric framework to reconsider how his theories contribute to a more capacious epistemology of the “plantation” in African American Studies. “Mapping the Global Black South” is thus organized around two interrelated concerns: the plantation as an alternative framework of black transnationalism and a site of cultural production that evinces the persistence of black life within structures of social death; and Tuskegee’s significance as a symbol of modernity and a nodal point of diasporic articulation at the turn of the twentieth century. In so doing, it illuminates how the plantation shaped the new futures that emerged in the US South and the Caribbean in the aftermath of slavery.",1720263968,,Dissertations & Theses," McInnis, Jarvis ConellMcInnisConellJarvisMcInnis, Jarvis Conell",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3830594751 , 93641402 , 66569 , 9781339061153 , 3723374 , 3723374", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339061153, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1720263968?accountid=14496," 0296 African American Studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," 0296 African American Studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," 0296 African American Studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature",," 0296 African American Studies , 0360 Caribbean literature , 0591 American literature"," African American Studies , Caribbean literature , American literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , African american , Caribbean , Diaspora , Global south , Labor , Modernity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Mapping+the+Global+Black+South%3A+Aesthetics%2C%0ALabor%2C+and+Diaspora&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McInnis%2C+Jarvis+Conell&amp;isbn=9781339061153&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Breaking the Silence: The Catholic Sexual Abuse Survivor Movement in Chicago,"This dissertation is a history of the lay Catholic clergy sexual abuse survivor movement, analyzed through the lens of three survivor advocacy groups: Victims of Clergy Abuse Linkup (LINKUP), the Survivor’s Network of those Abused by Priests (SNAP), and the Coalition of Concerned Catholics (CCC). More than any other population, the community of survivors comprised by the overlapping membership of these three lay organizations has shaped the discursive framework through which the U.S. news media have understood, articulated, and debated the pain of clergy sexual abuse. Drawing on four years of archival and ethnographic research, I argue that the Chicago survivor movement descended from the moral and ecclesiological visions of two preceding generations of Chicago Catholic activists, particularly in survivors’ commitment to women’s liturgical participation and the theology of personalism (as descended through the Catholic Worker movement). This research thus demonstrates that American survivors were not, as prior studies have suggested, coopted into a liberal reform agenda by the so-called “Catholic Left.” Rather, in both substance and form the ecclesiological and legal changes sought by LINKUP, SNAP, and CCC stem from the personal connections between the three women who founded the Chicago survivor movement, Jeanne Miller, Barbara Blaine, and Marilyn Steffel, and their mentors, particularly Nina Polcyn and Patricia Crowley. By harnessing the pain and suffering of betrayal, the Chicago survivor movement embodies an alternative vision of Catholic social justice. I introduce the term “politics of survivorhood” to describe this vision of the disenfranchised. The key politics of survivorhood explored herein are: (i) the recovery of voice as a means to survive abuse; (ii) the privileging of local communal conscience and democratic processes; (iii) the suspicion of patriarchal communities, prayers, and texts; (iv) a lived anthropology of communal suffering; (v) an approach to the “whole person” that integrates medical and religious approaches to heal body and soul; (vi) a set of judicial and legislative reforms that imagines global child abuse activism through a distinctly American Catholic framework; and (vii) a critique of clerical culture in favor of the post-Vatican II ecclesiological definition of church as “the People of God.”",1720843581,,Dissertations & Theses," Clites, Brian J.ClitesJ.BrianClites, Brian J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3831674521 , 99498432 , 66569 , 9781339076515 , 3724212 , 3724212", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339076515, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1720843581?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history"," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history"," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history",," 0318 Religion , 0337 American history"," Religion , American history"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , American history , Catholic , Laity , Roman catholicism , Sexual abuse , Vatican ii",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Breaking+the+Silence%3A+The+Catholic+Sexual+Abuse+Survivor+Movement+in+Chicago&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Clites%2C+Brian+J.&amp;isbn=9781339076515&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Have Your City and Eat It Too: Los Angeles and the Urban Food Renaissance,"Time and time again, the residents of Los Angeles have used the promises of the “garden city” and urban agriculture to imagine a way out of the persistent problems of urban life. In the contemporary moment, alternative food system activists are again working to create a cultural movement committed to “slow,” local and small-scale community-based urban food systems – which, paradoxically, they are organizing through sophisticated digital tools and global social media. This study argues that, beyond debates over urban diets, food is a lens through which post-industrial imaginaries of an egalitarian digital society are fused with pre-industrial imaginaries of utopian, agrarian communities. The consequence of these entangled visions is a unique set of practices that attempt to inject a sense of radical possibility into an urban geography that is itself the result of decades of struggle over land use, livelihoods, and urban culture. Drawing on a combination of archival research, ethnography, interviews and a survey, this dissertation examines how planners, boosters, government officials, and ordinary citizens have sought to wield food and agriculture in the city as a force to ameliorate the economic, social and ecological alienation that can dominate urban life. This study shows that the political, class and racial underpinnings of urban food movements are far more complex and contingent than normally understood, and the case of Los Angeles reveals both deeply conservative, reactionary moments and unprecedented coalitions emerging to make claims on the right to self determination, health and progressive social change in the city.",1725232394,,Dissertations & Theses," Tarr, Alexander RobertTarrRobertAlexanderTarr, Alexander Robert",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3844155721 , 99423682 , 66569 , 9781339019901 , 3720858 , 3720858", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339019901, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1725232394?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0999 Urban planning"," 0366 Geography , 0999 Urban planning"," 0366 Geography , 0999 Urban planning",," 0366 Geography , 0999 Urban planning"," Geography , Urban planning"," Social sciences , California , Digital studies , Food movements , Los Angeles , Urban agriculture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Have+Your+City+and+Eat+It+Too%3A+Los+Angeles+and+the+Urban+Food+Renaissance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tarr%2C+Alexander+Robert&amp;isbn=9781339019901&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Émigré Scientists of the Quotidian: Market Research and the American Consumer Unconscious, 1933–1976","This dissertation is a transnational intellectual and cultural history that examines the role played by a cohort of Central European market researchers and designers in the creation of modern American consumer culture. Each of four principal figures I consider—Paul Lazarsfeld, Ernest Dichter, Walter Landor, and Victor Gruen—was a German-speaking Jew who fled the rise of Nazism in the 1930s and established a very successful career in the United States. Although they all contributed their specialized knowledge and skills to the marketing strategies of American, consumer-oriented businesses, they worked in different fields: Lazarsfeld was a sociologist who practiced his technique, developed his methodologies, and supported his academic institutes by doing market research; Dichter was a psychologist who offered a kind of Freudian psychoanalysis as a consulting service for businesses and advertising agencies; Landor was an industrial designer and graphic artist who created attractive packages for consumer products; and Gruen was an architect who first imagined the suburban shopping center as a pedestrian space with malls and courts that fostered community as much as it facilitated commerce. Lazarsfeld, Dichter, and Gruen were from Vienna, which, in the course of their lifetimes, transformed from a liberalized imperial capital, to a hotbed of social democracy, to an outpost of fascism. Landor, meanwhile, was from Munich, the other city in which Adolf Hitler developed a virulent anti-Semitism that would have such profound consequences in the lives of these Jewish professionals, and for the world. While the work of Lazarsfeld and Dichter influenced the strategies of marketers, Gruen and Landor labored to produce the objects and physical environments that were the material manifestation of postwar consumerism. Their contributions to the material culture of American consumer capitalism grew out of the leftist ideology of Austro-Marxism, the radical experiment in social democracy that characterized interwar Vienna, transnational trends in empirical sociology, the popularization of Freudian psychoanalysis, the modernist aesthetic ethos of the German Bauhaus movement, and the ideal of cosmopolitan internationalism that motivated many German-speaking Jewish intellectuals in the capitals of Central Europe. This dissertation explores the surprising ways in which a cohort of émigrés integrated these Continental ideas and aesthetic sensibilities into the day-to-day operation of the burgeoning consumer economy of postwar America. Relative to existing scholarship, which is vexed by the problem of consumer agency and segregated into several historical genres, this thesis uses documents of the work of market researchers and designers to explain the complexity of consumers’ behaviors and motivations, and it synthesizes the methods of intellectual, business, and cultural history in the style of the new history of capitalism. My research shows that, from a business perspective, consumers’ choices and behaviors were never taken for granted; instead, consumers were intensely studied and even feared for their whims and unpredictability.",1727456952,,Dissertations & Theses," Malherek, JosephMalherekJosephMalherek, Joseph",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3848123211 , 94122212 , 66569 , 9781339027456 , 3721278 , 3721278", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339027456, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1727456952?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0338 Marketing"," 0323 American studies , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0338 Marketing"," 0323 American studies , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0338 Marketing",," 0323 American studies , 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0338 Marketing"," American studies , European history , American history , Marketing"," Social sciences , Advertising , Business , Consumer , Culture , Dichter, Ernest , Gruen, Victor , Immigrant , Jewish , Landor, Walter , Lazarsfeld, Paul , Market research",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=%C3%89migr%C3%A9+Scientists+of+the+Quotidian%3A+Market+Research+and+the+American+Consumer+Unconscious%2C+1933%E2%80%931976&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Malherek%2C+Joseph&amp;isbn=9781339027456&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Los Grupos and the art of intervention in 1960s and 1970s Mexico,"Throughout the 1960s and 70s, Mexican artists employed art interventions in commercial galleries, cultural institutions, and city streets to facilitate a renegotiation of the role of art (and the artist) in society. The art intervention, a mode of conceptualism, served to circumvent traditional spaces for the display of art and to destabilize and expose the hierarchies or power structures that shaped the art world and society at large. Artists began to explore alternative definitions of the artist and the art object as early as 1961, when progenitors of conceptualism such as Mathias Goeritz, José Luis Cuevas, and Alejandro Jodorowsky produced art interventions in galleries, theaters, art schools, museums, and public spaces. These new interventionist practices were forged within the context of local and global social revolutions. In Mexico, widespread repression and censorship at the hands of the state culminated in the 1968 student and workers’ movements. Tragically marked by the government-initiated massacre of peaceful demonstrators in Tlatelolco, the movement accelerated incidents of protest, police and military brutality, and a crisis within cultural institutions. Though the Mexican government presented itself as aligned with socialist causes, the 1970s saw an unofficial dirty war launched against perceived radicals to quash the momentum activists had gained in 1968. This heated environment found artists in a continuing struggle to find new forms of expression as well as spaces for the display of their work. Many turned to collectivization and conceptualist tactics in what has come to be called the movimiento de los grupos or the “Group Movement” that flourished between 1973 and 1979. Despite the proliferation of art interventions across the two decades (and within similar socio-political conditions) connections between the 1960s generation and the Grupos of the 1970s have not been adequately addressed. Accordingly, this project examines the ways in which strategies of intervention served as a form of resistance for both generations. I argue that the intervention served as a primary tool in the renegotiation of the social role of art and the artist.

Video became portable not only materially but also culturally; it could be carried by an individual, but it could also be carried into institutions from the RAND Corporation to the Black Panther Party, from psychiatrists’ offices to art galleries, and from prisons to state-funded media access centers. Between 1967 and 1973, American videographers across many of these institutional contexts participated in a common discourse, sharing not only practical knowledge about the uses and maintenance of video equipment, but visions of its social significance, psychological effects, and utopian future. For many, video was a technology which would bring about a new kind of awareness, the communal consiousness that—influenced by the evolutionary philosophy of Henri Bergson—Pierre Teilhard de Chardin referred to as the noosphere and Marshall McLuhan as the global village. Experimental videographers across several fields were also influenced by the psychedelic research of the 1950s and early 1960s, by the development of cybernetics as a science of both social systems and interactions between humans and machines, by anthropology and humanistic psychology, and by revolutionary political movements in the United States and around the world.",1728895905,,Dissertations & Theses," Collopy, Peter SachsCollopySachsPeterCollopy, Peter Sachs",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3854202201 , 97955722 , 66569 , 9781339052120 , 3722818 , 3722818", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339052120, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1728895905?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0459 Communication , 0585 Science history"," 0337 American history , 0459 Communication , 0585 Science history"," 0337 American history , 0459 Communication , 0585 Science history",," 0337 American history , 0459 Communication , 0585 Science history"," American history , Communication , Science history"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Consciousness , Media , Video",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+revolution+will+be+videotaped%3A+Making+a+technology+of+consciousness+in+the+long+1960s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Collopy%2C+Peter+Sachs&amp;isbn=9781339052120&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Perils of Home: Race, Gender, and Labor on the Pacific Frontier","In the early twentieth century, Chinese men and white women often worked in close proximity to each other in various intimate settings in the North American West— from the kitchens of upper class homes to the noisy cafés of the city. However, little has been said in the scholarship on the social and political significance of these encounters. Instead, this study centers on the different and connected ways in which intimacy shaped the North American West in the early twentieth century. As such, this work makes central and transparent the connections between the expansion of white women’s political and economic rights and efforts to exclude the Chinese in British Columbia and California. Thus, this study asks: How were changes in the status of white women and shifting notions of domesticity related to debates about Chinese labor and migration? Conversely, to what extent was the anti-Oriental movement and its calls for exclusionary measures informed and shaped by debates about gender roles? Last, how might a transnational analysis of these intersecting debates deepen our understanding of how such controversies shaped Vancouver and San Francisco as frontiers and gateways for Chinese labor migration and white settlement? If both Western Canada and the United States were primary sites for Asian labor migration and white settlement, did intimacy and affective labor play out differently in these two contexts? By using primary source documents to analyze two murder cases involving Chinese servants and two legislative efforts regarding affective labor in the distinct but connected contexts of Western Canada and the United States, this study shows how white women and Chinese men working together in intimate settings became increasingly scrutinized and subject to rampant social commentary and governmental intervention as racial, sexual, and class tensions flared.",1730862918,,Dissertations & Theses," Kim, Jason UlimKimUlimJasonKim, Jason Ulim",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3858568921 , 100044522 , 66569 , 9781339215990 , 3733324 , 3733324", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339215990, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1730862918?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0578 History , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0578 History , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0578 History , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0323 American studies , 0578 History , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American studies , History , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Asians in canada , Asians in united states , Canada , Domesticity , Intersectionality , Intimacy , White womanhood",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Perils+of+Home%3A+Race%2C+Gender%2C+and+Labor+on+the+Pacific+Frontier&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kim%2C+Jason+Ulim&amp;isbn=9781339215990&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Equality in the Shadows: Uncovering the Utopian Dimension of Palestinian Film and Media,"How does hope emerge amidst a hopeless situation, freedom amidst apartheid, equality amidst inequality? In the context of Palestine, where is utopian located? A possible answer to these enigmas presented itself in a Freedom March organized by a group of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March 2013. Carrying Palestinian flags, they crossed into a forbidden zone, boldly walking into the section of the street designated for Jewish settlers only. On their faces were masks of Martin Luther King, Jr., in their hands were portraits of Rosa Parks, and on their shirts were four English words: “I have a dream”. By resurrecting the imagery and iconography of the US Black Freedom Movement, these Palestinians were drawing new, imaginative constellations of counterhegemonic protest and forging transnational links of solidarity across time and space. The demonstrators thus staged a disruption. They temporarily interrupted the status quo and transgressed the rules and regulations of the hegemonic order. As a result, they were swiftly apprehended by uniformed members of the Israeli Defense Forces. As if to reenact a scene from Birmingham or Selma, the soldiers ripped the flags from the protesters’ hands and placed them in handcuffs. With MLK masks still on their faces, the demonstrators were loaded onto trucks and quickly taken out of sight. The protest was thus brought to a halt almost as soon as it had begun. In this way, an attempt was made to contain the disruption, to restore the ruling regime of hierarchy and segregation, and to sew up the tear that the demonstrators had ripped in the symbolic universe. But while the protesters themselves could be forcibly removed from the scene, the images they left behind could not be so easily erased. Photographs of the demonstration were immediately published on the Internet and circulated on social media websites. Like apparitions from another dimension, these images demonstrate that another world is possible, a world without ethnic- or religious-determined divisions, a world without apartheid walls, security fences, or segregated streets. They show that the unthinkable can be made thinkable, that the invisible can be made visible, and that the impossible can be made possible. This staged news spectacle represents just one example of a larger trend. In Equality in the Shadows, I look at the role of film, media, and culture in the Palestinian struggle against Zionist colonization. Basing my dissertation on both Edward Said’s notion of “the Palestinian Idea” and Jacques Rancière’s subversive redefinition of equality, I aim to show how through film and media, Palestinian liberation is not only a dream for a far-off and distant future but something that already exists in the present. While my dissertation has a strong foundation in film and media studies, I am drawing on a range of approaches, and I believe my work is relevant to scholars in a variety of disciplines including Black studies, cultural studies, global studies, Middle Eastern studies, politics, and sociology. Each chapter utilizes the work of several critical theorists, and I am attempting to put Palestinian media in conversation with writers such as Ernst Bloch, James Cone, Joan Copjec, Sigmund Freud, Stuart Hall, Dick Hebdige, C.L.R. James, Ghassan Kanafani, Robin D.G.

Analysts have overlooked the role of industrial firms in this transition by emphasizing either converging interests among capitalists or diverging interests between industrialists and financiers. The former approach obviates the need to delve into the subset, while the latter downplays the positive role of the industrialists in the process. In challenging these views, I argue that large US industrial firms unintentionally facilitated the rise of finance in their attempts to restore industrial profits by adopting new business strategies in the 1970s and 1980s. The success of these strategies required them to engage with minimally regulated financial markets and to support liberal economic policies, which created economic conditions conducive to financial expansion. Using original archival evidence and data on financial markets, I trace economic and political activities of US industrial firms and their impacts on the US economy during three shifts that dismantled restrictive postwar financial regimes and paved the way for the rise of finance in the US: (1) the rise of global finance, (2) the change in US monetary policy, and (3) the mergers and acquisitions movement. This research intervenes in key debates in the social sciences. First, it addresses the (capitalist) class dynamics related to contemporary financial transformation. Some observe a consensus within the capitalist class for a systemic change to renew the channel for profit-making, while others focuses on the intra-class conflicts surrounding the preferred venue for profits. Alternatively, I find that distinctive sectoral goals, but shared means, among capitalists led to the shift. Industrialists’ initiatives to rejuvenate industrial profits induced them to cooperate with financiers to promote liberal financial policies. Second, this project demonstrates how the financialization of the US economy co-evolved with the re-vitalization of the US industry in the late twentieth century, challenging prevalent views that emphasize the zero-sum dimension of the relationship between finance and industry. In particular, the chapter on the mergers and acquisitions movement shows that industrial corporations exploited takeover activities to restructure themselves. As such, this research encourages us to re-conceptualize “financialization.”",1731928771,,Dissertations & Theses," Ki, YounKiYounKi, Youn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3860957541 , 95093772 , 66569 , 9781339079998 , 3724489 , 3724489", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339079998, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1731928771?accountid=14496," 0501 Economics , 0508 Finance , 0615 Political science"," 0501 Economics , 0508 Finance , 0615 Political science"," 0501 Economics , 0508 Finance , 0615 Political science",," 0501 Economics , 0508 Finance , 0615 Political science"," Economics , Finance , Political science"," Social sciences , Finance , Large indstrial corporations , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Large+industrial+corporations+and+the+rise+of+finance+in+the+United+States&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ki%2C+Youn&amp;isbn=9781339079998&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Rogue pipelines, oil and amnesty: the social life of infrastructure in the Niger Delta","In October 2009, the Nigerian government signed a cease-fire and amnesty agreement to end a decade-long conflict with local militias in the Niger Delta agitating for greater political participation. Only one year later, as the new peace deal was celebrated as a success, the former conflict area became host to a lucrative and burgeoning illegal bunkering operation. These practices, diverting oil from the legal oil infrastructure to an alternate set of pipelines and refineries, implicated former militants, government soldiers and oil company managers alike. What linkages exist between the dissolution of a political armed social movement and the new rash of pipeline breaches? The events in the Niger Delta are often depicted as the outcome of contest to control oil rents by the state, transnational oil companies and indigenous population. However, this project explores the obverse and often overlooked dynamics undergirding eruptions of violence and protest: the ecology of economies, labor practices and practical relationships that have flourished around the oil infrastructure. Tracing the ways these complex social worlds are anchored in the material and institutional practices of production, rather than a contest for oil rents, the dissertation exposes how nodes of control in the Niger Delta are rendered increasingly porous, rather than defined by discrete actors and interests. Based on 21 months of fieldwork in the Niger Delta, I argue that the lifeworlds entwined with the technological infrastructure help unsettle the dominant arguments about rent-dependant oil states and state violence. They point instead to how practices seeking to delimit the space of extraction and operator liability such as community development initiatives, community subcontracting agreements and safety and security policies have produced hidden perils and exclusions under the rubrics of inclusion, peace and collaboration. This argument is developed over the course of several ethnographically grounded chapters. The first offers a material history of how the oil infrastructure became literally and figuratively embedded within Nigeria’s social and political life. Successive chapters follow as production practices are reconfigured institutionally, materially and discursively around a set of rogue pipelines and illegal refineries in the wake of the amnesty. I explore the constellations of oil community development regimes and the promotion of Nigeria’s “new” democracy; the explosion of oil theft and the concept of the oil economy; and increasing securitization and subcontracting practices. The dissertation demonstrates how these shifting arrangements, seeking to manage spaces of extraction, also generate alternate imaginaries of power, sovereignty and economy and that they render possible interventions, such as large-scale oil bunkering systems, which often exceed any single locus of control.",1732684219,,Dissertations & Theses," Gelber, ElizabethGelberElizabethGelber, Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3864330541 , 92775132 , 66569 , 9781339096902 , 3725414 , 3725414", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339096902, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1732684219?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Infrastructure , Labor , Niger Delta , Nigeria , Oil , Oil bunkering",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rogue+pipelines%2C+oil+and+amnesty%3A+the+social+life+of+infrastructure+in+the+Niger+Delta&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gelber%2C+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9781339096902&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Tracking Wildlife Conservation in Southern Africa: Histories of Protected Areas in Gorongosa and Maputaland,"In this dissertation, I argue that the development and demarcation of protected areas in southern Africa has not only been a process of defining boundaries but also of defining belonging. I focus specifically on how wildlife has been determined to belong in particular areas and how these animals have been claimed as belonging to individuals, communities, provinces, nations, and regions. I focus on the histories of wildlife conservation in Mozambique and the northern part of KwaZulu Natal, with particular emphasis on Gorongosa and Maputaland during the period from the early 1960s to the late 1990s, a time of great social and political change in both South Africa and Mozambique. I have selected these areas not to propose points of comparison between conservation practices in these neighboring countries, but rather to demonstrate complex continuities, exchanges, and cross-fertilizations. Ideas about wildlife conservation crossed national borders, as did animals, their advocates, and, eventually, protected area boundaries. By employing a transnational perspective on protected area histories, I illustrate and analyze this movement of personnel, non-human animals, and conservation practices between nation-states. By interrogating the scientific knowledge production and policy-making of protected area development, my narrative foregrounds the ways that wildlife has been implicated in and impacted by ideas about where these animals belong and to whom. Conceptions of indigeneity and nativeness, which tie belonging to place, have impacted the territories and scales of protected areas, as well as what (or who) has the right to dwell within their borders. However, these categories of belonging are not inherent to the wildlife species they have been attributed to. Instead, “belonging” is a condition that is made through a complex network of biocultural interactions. It is produced through dynamic constellations of political conditions, cultural values, economic interests, scientific ways of knowing, and animal behavior.",1733693340,,Dissertations & Theses," McKeown, KathleenMcKeownKathleenMcKeown, Kathleen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3868640621 , 100252242 , 66569 , 9781339235790 , 3734824 , 3734824", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339235790, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1733693340?accountid=14496," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0293 African Studies , 0329 Ecology , 0331 African history"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0293 African Studies , 0329 Ecology , 0331 African history"," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0293 African Studies , 0329 Ecology , 0331 African history",," 0284 Wildlife Conservation , 0293 African Studies , 0329 Ecology , 0331 African history"," Wildlife Conservation , African Studies , Ecology , African history"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Belonging , Indigeneity , Mozambique , Protected areas , South Africa , Wildlife conservation",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Tracking+Wildlife+Conservation+in+Southern+Africa%3A+Histories+of+Protected+Areas+in+Gorongosa+and+Maputaland&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McKeown%2C+Kathleen&amp;isbn=9781339235790&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Towards urban equity: A just sustainabilities analysis of municipal sustainability policy and planning,"Since the early 1990s, there has been a call for local governments to engage in environmental sustainability planning as an integral part of global sustainable development. Similar to broader sustainable development movements, cities often frame their actions around a triumvirate of concern areas (economic growth, social development and environmental sustainability) to achieve corresponding goals. This dissertation examines and evaluates the challenges and outcomes of urban planning in an U.S urban city. It focuses on municipal environmental sustainability efforts integrated with environmental justice principles, using sustainability as the policy focus and giving attention to equity and justice concerns. This study attempts to distill whether planning and policy are undergirded by equitable practices that ultimately lead to improved considerations and conditions for marginalized communities. Drawing on these strategies this study investigates the tensions between urbanization, sustainability and equity concerns by looking at broader policy issues that extend beyond the analysis of planning, and includes investigating the mechanisms that undergird urban growth and development. A just sustainabilities (Agyeman, 2013) framework will be used to gauge how municipal comprehensive development goes about the work of planning and achieving sustainable development. The work concludes that while cities are conscious of social inequities that are exacerbated and promoted by environmental inequality, it highlights that marginalized communities need a greater voice in policy development to promote more equitable outcomes; while more aggressive policies and development action that disseminate from governments are needed to actively identify and eradicate environmental threats and concurrently promote improved quality of life outcomes, such as access to greenspace, improved mobility options and healthy food options.",1733992286,,Dissertations & Theses," Teron, LemirTeronLemirTeron, Lemir",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3869542131 , 100269032 , 66569 , 9781339164564 , 3730256 , 3730256", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339164564, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1733992286?accountid=14496," 0619 Environmental Justice , 0640 Sustainability , 0999 Urban planning"," 0619 Environmental Justice , 0640 Sustainability , 0999 Urban planning"," 0619 Environmental Justice , 0640 Sustainability , 0999 Urban planning",," 0619 Environmental Justice , 0640 Sustainability , 0999 Urban planning"," Environmental Justice , Sustainability , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Environmental justice , Just sustainabilities , Sustainability planning , Urban policy , Urban sustainability",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Towards+urban+equity%3A+A+just+sustainabilities+analysis+of+municipal+sustainability+policy+and+planning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Teron%2C+Lemir&amp;isbn=9781339164564&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Direct and indirect effects of the caribbean cymothoid parasite &lt;i&gt; Anilocra haemuli&lt;/i&gt; on host energetics, behavior, and trophic interactions","The majority of coral reef research focuses on organisms that are familiar to humans, yet 80% of coral reef animals are parasites. Research on the direct effects of parasitism has suggested that hosts may undergo both behavioral and physiological changes. These changes may manifest at the ecosystem level, yet evidence of such changes are scarce. The objectives of this study were to investigate the direct and indirect effects of the Caribbean cymothoid parasite Anilocra haemuli on Haemulon flavolineatum (French grunt) energetics, behavior and trophic interactions. I conducted field surveys to measure A. haemuli prevalence of infection and determine its association with French grunt host affiliation. To determine if and how infection alters host movement patterns. I quantified the effects of Anilocra spp. on host energetics by measuring different forms of energy acquisition and expenditure, and conducted similar analyses on Chromis multilineata (brown chromis) infected by Anilocra multilineata. Additionally, I tested the effects of A. haemuli infection on host respiration. Lastly, I conducted Carbon and Nitrogen stable isotope analyses on uninfected and Anilocra spp.-infected fish tissues to determine how parasitism influences host trophic interactions. My research suggests that the prevalence of A. haemuli infection is highly variable and correlated with host social affiliation. Moreover, A. haemuli infection is associated with reduced host movement and activity patterns. Although A. haemuli infection was associated with reduced host muscle tissue condition, other measures of energy acquisition and expenditure were similar between infected and uninfected fish. Interestingly, A. multilineata infection on brown chromis did not influence any measure of energy acquisition or expenditure. My respirometry experiment determined that A. haemuli infection increases respiratory demands of French grunt even after parasite removal. The stable isotope analyses I conducted determined that Anilocra spp.-infected fish forage similarly to uninfected fish, A. haemuli infected French grunt are starving, and Anilocra spp. parasites are approximately 1 trophic level higher than their hosts. This research is the first to determine the role of Caribbean cymothoids in coral reef trophic interactions using both field and laboratory analyses, and provides baseline data for future global comparisons of Anilocra spp.-host trophic dynamics.",1734895625,,Dissertations & Theses," Welicky, Rachel LynnWelickyLynnRachelWelicky, Rachel Lynn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3872136041 , 97399912 , 66569 , 9781339247250 , 3735890 , 3735890", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339247250, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1734895625?accountid=14496," 0306 Biology , 0329 Ecology , 0768 Environmental science"," 0306 Biology , 0329 Ecology , 0768 Environmental science"," 0306 Biology , 0329 Ecology , 0768 Environmental science",," 0306 Biology , 0329 Ecology , 0768 Environmental science"," Biology , Ecology , Environmental science"," Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Anilocra haemuli , Coral reef , Food web dynamics , French grunt , Haemulon flavolineatum , Parasites",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Direct+and+indirect+effects+of+the+caribbean+cymothoid+parasite+%0AAnilocra+haemuli+on+host+energetics%2C+behavior%2C+and+trophic+interactions&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Welicky%2C+Rachel+Lynn&amp;isbn=9781339247250&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Heritage of the Future: Historical Keyboards, Technology, and Modernism","This dissertation examines modernist twentieth-century applications of the pipe organ and the carillon in the United States and in the Netherlands. These keyboard instruments, historically owned by religious or governmental entities, served an exceptionally diverse variety of political, technological, social, and urban planning functions. Their powerful simultaneous associations with historicism and innovation enabled those who built and played them to anchor the instruments’ novel uses in the perceived authority of tradition, church, and state. This usage became particularly evident after World War II, when Philips Electronics and the engineers and musicians whose careers were shaped by the military-industrial complex and the Cold War used the organ and carillon to present alternative visions and performances of their research, knowledge, and services. The organ served as a vehicle for innovation for early electronic music and sound synthesis pioneers in three ways. First, it provided a model for an efficient user interface for new synthesizer technologies that found both musical and military communications applications. Second, the pipe organ became the first instrument to be electronically simulated on a commercially viable basis. As a result, the first federal legal proceedings to define the successful simulation of musical sound centered on the electronic organ. Electronic organs also helped shape a historicist “neo-baroque” movement that was, in part, both a reaction to and an outgrowth of their commercial success. Third, inventors in the field of electronics, particularly military electronics, turned to organ building to satisfy a desire to connect with historicist ideas about craft and tradition. They became leaders of the Organ Reform Movement after World War II, dedicated to reviving aspects of Baroque organ building. I build on Richard Taruskin’s critique of “historically informed performance” as itself a form of modernism in order to elucidate previously overlooked relationships between Reform organ building, organ recording artists, the military-industrial complex, and cold war politics. The carillon served as a vehicle for international exchange after World War II, facilitating the sharing of soundscape and landscape design ideas between America and the Netherlands. In the 1950s, the people of the Netherlands donated a carillon to the United States as a sounding symbol of political harmony between the two allies. However, the resulting political squabbles and the disharmony and decay of its bells tolled the ineffectiveness of this instrument of diplomacy. In the following decade, Philips Electronics took inspiration from suburban American corporate research parks to construct a techno-cultural complex in Eindhoven, the Netherlands. This International Style park used the Dutch carillon’s sonic and visual symbolism to re-center the perceived core of Eindhoven and of civic authority onto Philips’ campus. An important part of the broader history of postwar expansion and the military-industrial complex are the science-fiction, mystery, and filmic spinoffs and sonic imaginaries associated with these reinvented carillons and organs, and the way such narratives cross the boundaries between high art and popular culture. The institutions and donors that built carillons often justified them with utopian rhetoric about creating community, public music, and elevating general musical taste. However, a vein of dystopian fiction about bells in literature, opera, film, and television counterbalanced that discourse. The realm of fiction ties together this dissertation’s overarching themes of historical revival, technological innovation, modernism, and military electronics research.",1735411080,,Dissertations & Theses," Ng, Tiffany KwanNgKwanTiffanyNg, Tiffany Kwan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3874199161 , 99768502 , 66569 , 9781339216492 , 3733374 , 3733374", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339216492, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1735411080?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0413 Music"," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0413 Music"," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0413 Music",," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0413 Music"," European history , American history , Music"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Bells , Carillon , Electronic instruments , Electronic music , Organ , Pipe organ",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Heritage+of+the+Future%3A+Historical+Keyboards%2C+Technology%2C+and+Modernism&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ng%2C+Tiffany+Kwan&amp;isbn=9781339216492&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Out of Sync: Is There a Mismatch Between the American Environmental Movement and Public Opinion?,"In this dissertation, I examine four national environmental organizations, the Sierra Club, the Wilderness Society, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and Friends of the Earth, in order to determine whether the American environmental movement is an effective advocate of the most pressing environmental concerns of the American public or not. My analysis is based on a comparison of the top environmental priorities of the four organizations with the greatest environmental worries of the general public. The study uses both qualitative and quantitative research methods spanning a 30-year time period. Based on a framing analysis of the groups' annual reports my goal is to determine whether the organizations present their top issues in a human-centered or nature-centered frame. That is, are the organizations mostly concerned how environmental degradation affects wild habitats or do they focus on aspects such as public health? The findings of the framing analysis are then compared to findings based on public opinion data. Here, I use a battery of questions presented by the Gallup Poll to determine a ranking of peoples' biggest environmental worries. The results show that all four national environmental organizations presented their top issues with a strong nature-centered frame in the 1980s and 1990s; but in the 2000s, three of the organizations added a human-centered frame when discussing environmental degradation. Also, the focus on wildlife and wilderness issues diminished during the most recent decade; and other issues, mostly pollution, global warming and energy were covered more frequently. Here, the environmental organizations are more congruent with the general public who names pollution issues as their biggest environmental worry throughout the 21 years (1989-2010) of the analysis. Public opinion data also show that global warming has been consistently at the bottom of the list of environmental worries. Here, the environmental organizations seem to overestimate peoples' concerns regarding a highly publicized issue which puts them out of sync with the American public. Finally, based on regression analysis I examined how people with different demographic backgrounds and political standing evaluate environmental problems. For instance, I was interested to see whether Republicans, while being less inclined to worry about global warming, express similar opinions toward less politically charged issues such as water pollution. The findings show that a partisan divide is thoroughly established during the 2000s and that it exists for all analyzed environmental problems. In regard to demographics, non-white Americans and people with a high school education or less are more likely to be worried about various environmental problems than whites and people with at least some college education. The result could have important ramifications for major environmental organizations. It shows that, while bi-partisan support for the environment is unlikely in the near future, the groups have the option to diversify their constituency based on racial, ethnic, and social backgrounds. Such a diversification could help the environmental movement to increase their political clout and to become a more influential player in national politics.

Hence, understanding the potential of direct or indirect competition between wolves and humans is useful for managers. In Chapter 1, I used a novel approach utilizing spatially-linked interviews to quantify the distance subsistence users were traveling from communities and rivers to harvest moose in the Yukon Flats. My study was the first to quantify hunter access in the Arctic and may provide managers with a harvest estimation approach that may supplement the current harvest ticket system, for which reporting is considered consistently low. My final results and model may be used by game managers outside of the Yukon Flats where hunter success is linked to access to forecast the impact of creating new access on game populations or forecast the effect of access closure on game populations. In Chapter 2, I quantified wolf movement and evaluated resource selection by wolves within a low prey-density system. I used Global Positioning System (GPS) collars to characterize wolf movement. My results were the first in the literature to examine wolf movements in a low prey-density system and demonstrate that wolves travel farther to make kills. My results provided a mechanism for explaining large wolf territories, which are documented in low prey-density systems, and in our system. Within high prey-density systems, managers could expect wolf travel distances to increase if prey density decreases, resulting in larger territories within their respective systems. My results also demonstrate that similar to high prey-density systems, wolves were utilizing river corridors. By understanding that hunter access for moose and wolf travel paths both occur along rivers, we postulate possible competition along navigable waters. I used the results of my spatial analysis in Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 to evaluate the likelihood of competition between hunters and wolves. I found that in a pack overlapping navigable water, 75% of its use points fall within hunter use areas. However, my spatial data of wolf and human use did not overlap temporally. I suggest that evaluating competition would require comprehensive biological and social datasets which encapsulate moose, wolf, and human behavior. It is critical that these dataset overlap spatially and temporally.",1750592077,,Dissertations & Theses," Johnson, IanJohnsonIanJohnson, Ian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3901057271 , 99767032 , 66569 , 9781339321905 , 1605433 , 1605433", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339321905, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1750592077?accountid=14496," 0286 Wildlife Management , 0329 Ecology"," 0286 Wildlife Management , 0329 Ecology"," 0286 Wildlife Management , 0329 Ecology",," 0286 Wildlife Management , 0329 Ecology"," Wildlife Management , Ecology"," Biological sciences , Alaska , Arctic , Hunters , Moose , Wolf , Yukon Flats",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Space+use+and+movements+of+moose+hunters+and+wolves+in+the+Yukon+Flats%2C+Alaska&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Johnson%2C+Ian&amp;isbn=9781339321905&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Strategies to Sustain Public Private Partnership: A Lebanese Agency Case Study,"Four public private partnerships have been created in Lebanon to fulfill the promises of better public value and accelerated economic development for sustainable business development. The problem is some business owners embark on public private partnership projects without following known documented strategies that ensure business sustainability. The purpose of the single case study was to explore the strategies business owners used to sustain public private partnership businesses in Lebanon. The conceptual framework included the theory of X-efficiency and the new public management model. The Northern Lebanon public private partnership was chosen for the study. All 7 business owners participated through interviews for data collection. The emergent themes from the interviews were compared and contrasted across participants’ responses and were cross referenced with the academic literature and printed agency reports. Data interpretations were triangulated through member checking. The business owners identified 7 specific strategies to monitor the agency’s work. The top 3 strategies were proper selection of partners, the need for a strong technical director, and hiring of professional staff. Three additional strategies noted were the articulation of a clear mission and vision, followed by the development of bylaws and the identification of international best practices. Holding monthly partners’ meetings to discuss emerging needs was the last strategy identified for consistent follow up and forward movement of the businesses. The findings over time could promote social change in Lebanon by revealing how municipalities can partner with the private sector and nongovernment organizations to reduce poverty, create jobs, and ensure local economic development.",1751011250,,Dissertations & Theses," Sweidan, Nada DimachkiehSweidanDimachkiehNadaSweidan, Nada Dimachkieh",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3902107021 , 99886452 , 66569 , 9781339328119 , 3740699 , 3740699", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339328119, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1751011250?accountid=14496," 0310 Business administration , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," 0310 Business administration , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," 0310 Business administration , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0640 Sustainability",," 0310 Business administration , 0555 Middle Eastern Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," Business administration , Middle Eastern Studies , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Local economic development , Local economic development agencies , Local government , Microbusiness , Public private partnerships , Strategy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Strategies+to+Sustain+Public+Private+Partnership%3A+A+Lebanese+Agency+Case+Study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sweidan%2C+Nada+Dimachkieh&amp;isbn=9781339328119&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Moral Vandals: Street Artists in the Service of Change,"Street art is a term that has historically specified its site of display: the street.  With its increasing mainstream popularity, however, the term “street” has become abstracted from this definition which implies a direct reference to art that is literally painted on the streets to refer to a much broader movement, which is often marked by defining principles rather than a uniform medium or location.  This is not to say that street artists do not sometimes perform illegal actions, but that for them, street art is becoming more of an ideology rather than a particular aesthetic style. In other words, street art is not restricted to any medium, format, school, or technique; but instead, is centered around messages. Moral Vandals: Street Artists in the service of Change, examines the ways in which contemporary street artists have shifted their practices from traditional, vandalistic graffiti to more socially based practices in order to effect more immediate and direct change. These artists dispel the notion of street and graffiti artists as vandals to reveal an ethical dimension of street art practice. This dissertation moves beyond the examination of simple, territorial interventions such as wall painting to examine artists who work with global communities, sometimes much like aid workers, but in the service of their art practice, which has social and moral aims. The traditional ethos of this contemporary street art has evolved into a complex matrix encompassing the ethics of philanthropy, social work, and colonization. This necessarily gives rise to many ethical issues and repercussions. This dissertation aims to reorient the reputation of street art as an outsider practice and situate it as a global contemporary art practice that not only has very real linkages to the high art world, but also aims to better society.",1751022111,,Dissertations & Theses," Bullock, Lara KathrynBullockKathrynLaraBullock, Lara Kathryn",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3902129331 , 96181012 , 66569 , 9781339330549 , 3740924 , 3740924", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339330549, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1751022111?accountid=14496, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history, 0377 Art history,, 0377 Art history, Art history," Communication and the arts , Graffiti , Jr , Ngo , Os gemeos , Street art , Swoon",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Moral+Vandals%3A+Street+Artists+in+the+Service+of+Change&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bullock%2C+Lara+Kathryn&amp;isbn=9781339330549&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Between Ethnic Minority and Diaspora: Zainichi Koreans in the era of Global War on Terror,"My dissertation examines the negotiation of citizenship and belonging among Zainichi Koreans (Koreans in Japan) in contemporary Japan. My analysis focuses on the pro-North Korean schools that have become a target of state sanctions, racist hate crimes and media misrepresentation since the revelation of North Korean abductions of Japanese civilians on September 17, 2002. Situating Japan’s anti-North Korean sentiments in a broader context of the global War on Terror, my dissertation reveals how the War on Terror has shaped Japan’s national security discourses and practices, and how the United States has turned the issue of Japanese abductees into an “American” concern, together constructing North Korea as a military and moral threat and justifying various sanctions against North Korea and its associates including those in Japan including pro-North Korean schools. Through ethnographic observation and in-depth interviews, as well as analysis on newspaper articles, government documents, court transcripts, blog entries and tweets, my dissertation examines various survival strategies and tactics that Korean schools have employed. In their efforts to bring life to the space that is meant to disappear, members of the Korean schools devote material, intellectual, cultural and affective labors. In order to navigate and defy the stigma as well as material and symbolic consequences of being labeled as “(potential) terrorists,” Korean schools have also mobilized cultural and political discourses and practices, specifically employing “multicultural coexistence” (tabunka ky?sei) and “students are innocent” narrative as viable frameworks to explain why they are legible and sympathetic subjects. I argue that Zainichi Koreans’ recent social movements on local, national and international levels challenge the traditional pathways to belonging, and disavow full inclusion as the basis of claiming civil rights, while at the same time illuminating the limits of liberal multiculturalism that seeks to depoliticize and dehistoricize Korean schools and education. Simultaneously Korean diasporic subjects and ethnic minorities of Japan, Zainichi Koreans (re)claim ideological and emotional ties with their homeland(s) while claiming full membership and equal rights in Japan, posing a radical alternative to imagining “minority politics” that is not simply about liberal incorporation, but also about engaging in unthinkable politics.",1751029131,,Dissertations & Theses," Ha, Kyung HeeHaHeeKyungHa, Kyung Hee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3902137421 , 98026152 , 66569 , 9781339330815 , 3740944 , 3740944", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339330815, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1751029131?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Asian Studies , Sociology , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Korean schools , Multicultural coexistence , Social movements , Unification , War on terror , Zainichi koreans",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Between+Ethnic+Minority+and+Diaspora%3A+Zainichi+Koreans+in+the+era+of+Global+War+on+Terror&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ha%2C+Kyung+Hee&amp;isbn=9781339330815&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Intimate Empire: Women's Travel Writing and U.S. Imperialism 1880-1920,"This dissertation examines how several turn-of-century U.S. women journalists and travel writers represent U.S. imperialism in a range of locales, trafficking in prevailing discourses of gender and race to represent colonized Others and as they engage in a comparative analysis to evaluate women’s status in the U.S. In doing so, I suggest that these women, largely overlooked in critical discourses on U.S. imperialism, nonetheless contributed to the U.S. imperial imaginary. By recuperating the work of “newspaper ladies” Margherita Hamm, Nellie Bly, and Mary Krout, and through a reconsideration of Edith Wharton’s travel writing, I consider the complex ways that white U.S. women negotiated the nexus of gender and race as consumers and producers of U.S. imperial ideology from 1880-1920. These texts reveal how white women utilized their white racial privilege to negotiate gender oppression at home and abroad. By exploring this subset of U.S. women’s travel writing, I aim to examine the New Woman through a transnational lens, thus illuminating the intersection of empire, gender, and race at the dawn of what would be dubbed the American century. This study reveals the ways that white women utilized travel and text to foreground varying levels of commitment to the women’s movement and to create alternate feminine identities and spaces for public and political engagement. In doing so, they often reify white racial privilege through their support for imperialism along with their utilization of social evolutionary theories, which posited white women as racially and biologically superior to non-white men and women.",1752220831,,Dissertations & Theses," Bebell, AndreaBebellAndreaBebell, Andrea",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3906960951 , 96206482 , 66569 , 9781339343051 , 3741905 , 3741905", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339343051, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1752220831?accountid=14496," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," American literature , British and Irish literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Gender , Race , Suffrage , Travel writing , U.s. imperialism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Intimate+Empire%3A+Women%27s+Travel+Writing+and+U.S.+Imperialism+1880-1920&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bebell%2C+Andrea&amp;isbn=9781339343051&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Unfading halo: The untold progressivism of Elihu Root,"In the latter decades of the nineteenth century, reformers across the nation looked to study, understand, and resolve the major political, social, economic, and moral issues gripping the nation. This study uncovers the rather unlikely progressive credentials of a highly influential lawyer, diplomat, and statesman, Elihu Root. Contemporary critics and political opponents unfairly categorized him as a conservative, and callous corporate lawyer who opposed the Progressive movement at every turn. This inaccurate characterization unduly influenced historical conceptions of the Root and his legacy. On the contrary, Root modernized, reformed, and advanced progressive institutions at home and abroad. Root recognized the growing need for reform, accountability, and efficiency of public institutions, while also promoting an individual responsibility need for education, morality, and self-restraint. Elite lawyers such as Root formed a significant majority of progressive reformers who sought restore public trust in civil government, depoliticize civil service appointments, destroy political machines, ensure the sanctity of the ballot, increase legal access for the poor, promote campaign finance reform, enact corporate and inheritance taxes, and bust trusts. Root devoted his public career to carrying out the public good and uplifting society. Though Root’s domestic reform agenda mirrored the efforts of his progressive counterparts, what set him apart was the fact he transplanted these progressive ideals into reforms into America foreign policy. Since progressives empowered the government to resolve domestic concerns, it only makes sense they used the full force of Washington to solve problems that confronted the globe. He represented a minority of internationally progressive lawyer-diplomats who sought to bring order to the interactions of states, reduce global conflicts, and introduce worldwide institutions comprised of more nations than ever before. He promoted American involvement in international institutions well before the creation of the League of Nations and developed many of the concepts that later comprised part of the United Nations created nearly a decade after his death. Presidents of both parties and numerous secretaries of state worked with Root to secure progressive international policies, ranging from the creation of the World Court to international policies of disarmament.",1754384235,,Dissertations & Theses," Little, RobLittleRobLittle, Rob",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3914217271 , 101254802 , 66569 , 9781339339214 , 3741579 , 3741579", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339339214, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1754384235?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0578 History"," 0337 American history , 0578 History"," 0337 American history , 0578 History",," 0337 American history , 0578 History"," American history , History"," Social sciences , Diplomatic history , Progressivism , Reform",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unfading+halo%3A+The+untold+progressivism+of+Elihu+Root&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Little%2C+Rob&amp;isbn=9781339339214&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Nomadic/Sporadic: The Pathways of Circulation of Indigenous Video in Latin America,"Over the last thirty years, a growing indigenous video movement in Latin America has sought to connect localized communication processes rooted in common struggles with continental and pan-Indigenous networks. Indigenous organizations and media-makers in the region are creating distinct media projects, agreements, and linkages that demonstrate how coordinated local mobilization and transnational networking might allow Indigenous peoples to effectively challenge the pervasive ""indigenist"" rhetoric. This rhetoric promotes concepts of development, assimilation, and citizenship as perpetuated by laws, treaties, and constitutions across Latin American nation-states. This dissertation discusses how Indigenous-produced film and video has gained significance not only within local communities, but also transnationally around the globe. The thesis surveys Indigenous media production in the region, underscoring its ties to specific community and organizational protocols, and examines its circulation, which is occurring mainly outside industrial film circuits. I argue that Indigenous film festivals and other pan-indigenous gatherings have become emblematic events that make visible Indigenous responses to social and political conflict, while presenting an array of strategies to secure their rights. These gatherings bring together widely dispersed media works and authors, opening up spaces for debate around indigenous rights and representation, and facilitating the dissemination of media back to indigenous communities and beyond. Festivals become support networks, discussion forums, and a venue for new work and directors, performing a unique and critical role in circulating Indigenous thought and practices.",1754428583,,Dissertations & Theses," Hidalgo, Amalia Isabel CordovaHidalgoIsabel CordovaAmaliaHidalgo, Amalia Isabel Cordova",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3913063141 , 94994242 , 66569 , 9781339328522 , 3740738 , 3740738", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339328522, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1754428583?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0740 Native American studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0740 Native American studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0740 Native American studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0740 Native American studies , 0900 Film studies"," Latin American Studies , Native American studies , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Film festivals , Indigenous media , Video indígena",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Nomadic%2FSporadic%3A+The+Pathways+of+Circulation+of+Indigenous+Video+in+Latin+America&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hidalgo%2C+Amalia+Isabel+Cordova&amp;isbn=9781339328522&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Magonista Insurrection and the San Diego Free Speech Fight: A Volatile U.S.-Mexican Border Region at the Turn of the 20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century,"At the turn of the 20th century, two events rocked the western-most corner of the U.S.-Mexico border: The Magonista Insurrection of 1911 and the I.W.W. San Diego Free Speech Fight of 1912. Throughout the late 18th and early 19th century, the United States and Mexico experienced a period of rapid industrialization and modernization. This vast social and economic transformation restructured society to better meet the demands of the new industrial-capitalist order. Aside from experiencing an erosion of traditions and a drastic shift in day-to-day social life, inhabitants from both sides of the border encountered analogous worker grievances by new industrial conditions. Workers experienced an increase in demand for productivity all while wages stagnated and working conditions deteriorated. In addition, worker unions and organizations were cruelly repressed by the state acting in the interest of business. As grievances persisted and wealth continued to be disproportionally distributed, workers began to envision a world where the toiler received the full product of his or her toil. Radical groups were formed that directly engaged in disputes with both capital and the state. When the call-to-arms by Ricardo Flores Magon was sent to all sympathizers to aid and/or join the Magonista Insurrection in radically transforming society for the betterment of the peasant and worker class, first in Baja then throughout the world, many individuals in the U.S. answered. Captivated by Flores Magon’s allure of utopia and adventure, a number of Wobblies flocked into San Diego and then into Tijuana. A year later, the most volatile and infamous I.W.W. Free Speech Fight took place in San Diego. These events are often studied separately, however, in connecting them, one observes a transnational history of labor movements that is often ignored by national historical narratives.",1754615459,,Dissertations & Theses," Lopez, MayraLopezMayraLopez, Mayra",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3915097951 , 101279472 , 66569 , 9781339347158 , 1605898 , 1605898", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339347158, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1754615459?accountid=14496, 0578 History, 0578 History, 0578 History,, 0578 History, History," Social sciences , Border , Diego , Fight , Free , Insurrection , Magonista , Speech , U.s.-mexican , Volatile",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Magonista+Insurrection+and+the+San+Diego+Free+Speech+Fight%3A%0AA+Volatile+U.S.-Mexican+Border+Region+at+the+Turn+of+the+20th%0ACentury&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Lopez%2C+Mayra&amp;isbn=9781339347158&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"State and Ideology: Youth Public Policy in Ontario,"As global youth unemployment and youth led social movements become increasingly widespread, states have begun to consider youth a policy concern.

This dissertation investigates holistic education as it occurs in Dalcroze pedagogy. Five Dalcroze teachers and students with varying levels of experience were asked to consider and express holistic learning experiences they encountered when participating in Dalcroze classes. The data is developed and portrayed as narratives, guided by the qualitative research philosophies of Beattie, Eisner, and Clandinin and Connelly.

Placing the rise of environmental consciousness in East Germany in conversation with developments in West Germany and Poland, my project examines how the communist dictatorship and the small but growing opposition each grappled with the mounting pollution problem. Specifically, the dissertation considers why the dictatorship embraced environmental protection—even codifying the right to a clean environment in its 1968 constitution—and how it implemented this mandate. Yet, as the new environmental regulation and social policies raised East Germans’ expectations for a cleaner environment and a higher quality of life, their failures became increasingly manifest. As a result, a protest movement formed in the only institution not controlled by the communist party, the Protestant Church. I argue that Christian activists formulated a critique that challenged not only official environmental practices, but ultimately, the system as a whole. Although this criticism figured prominently in the Round Table discussions leading to reunification in 1990, our understanding of the connections between the environment and communism as well as their legacies remain as yet understudied. This examination of pollution, policy, and protest challenges traditional narratives about environmentalism. First, within the GDR, studying the interactions between institutions, politics, and society illuminates the complex negotiations between state and society under communism. Because environmentalism was not strictly viewed as oppositional, actors engaged in a range of activities for a common cause. Second, I argue that environmental consciousness arose for a variety of domestic and international reasons under communism, neither simply borrowing from western, liberal democracies nor developing in isolation from them. In fact, environmentalism in the GDR drew on a multitude of outside influences, such as western green movements, Christian texts, Soviet rhetoric, and Eastern European dissidents, to respond to serious, local degradation. This broadens the accepted narratives of environmentalism as originating solely in western, liberal democracies and highlights how both Germanys engaged with the environment to support their claims to legitimacy. Environmentalism in the GDR bridged the Iron Curtain, demonstrating the limitations of bipolar understandings of Europe during the Cold War. Its largest success, perhaps, was how uncontentious environmental cleanup proved to be during the unification process in the 1990s. Both East and West Germans had accepted its importance.",1757807038,,Dissertations & Theses," Ault, Julia ElizabethAultElizabethJuliaAult, Julia Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3924590621 , 96488662 , 66569 , 9781339390796 , 3745973 , 3745973", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339390796, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1757807038?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0578 History"," 0335 European history , 0578 History"," 0335 European history , 0578 History",," 0335 European history , 0578 History"," European history , History"," Social sciences , East germany , Environment , Poland , West germany",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Saving+Nature+in+Socialism%3A+East+Germany%27s+Official+and+Independent+Environmentalism%2C+1968-1990&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ault%2C+Julia+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9781339390796&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Contentious Representations: Interpretations of the Representation of French Regional Architecture 1914-1939,"This work attempts to trace the evolution of French regionalism during the first half of the twentieth century from the Great War into the interwar period.

Recent review of the literature has also revealed that there is a significant relationship between these two constructs (Coskunpinar &amp; Cyders, 2013). The current study used college undergraduate social drinkers (at least 3 drinks per week) (n = 42, mean age = 23.27 (SD = 5.21), female: 69.2%) to examine the relationship between specific trait impulsivity facets and alcohol-related attentional biases and to examine how this relationship is affected by measurement type (eye movement, reaction time measures), attentional bias constructs (initial orientation, delayed disengagement), and environmental cues (specifically mood and alcohol olfactory cues).

Understanding community responses to mining in southern Peru,"This dissertation examines response by local Peruvian communities to extraction pressures from international mining companies. The main comparison is between two cases in southern Peru, which responded differently to the possibility of mining during the years 2007 to 2012: one accepting, one rejecting. The Quellaveco project in Moquegua received authorization after a Roundtable negotiation, while intense protests halted Tía María in Arequipa. The specific question explored here is how neighboring Peruvian communities came to mobilize differently in response to mining pressure. More broadly, why do local populations organize high-magnitude mobilizations against corporate concerns in some cases, but not in others? The investigation analyzes how social movements theories, 1) interests, 2) resource mobilization (RM), and 3) political opportunity structures (POS) account for variation in magnitude of mobilization between the selected cases. Research consists of interviews with over 80 community leaders, government representatives, academics, and community members, in addition to in-depth review of newspaper articles and published secondary resources. In terms of theory, the investigation finds evidence for the importance of interests via socioeconomic effects and perceptions of risk in activating resources, and explaining variation between high and low-magnitude mobilization. At the same time, the combination of resource mobilization and political opportunity structures explain mobilizers’ ability to protest. There is also learning, as previous mobilization experiences affect interests, RM and POS. Furthermore, varied positions of stakeholders influence each theory, and the magnitude of mobilization. Together, the cases confirm the significance of the synthetic approach in social movements theory, in which a combination of all three theories largely determines a community’s level of response to extraction pressures. As for empirics, there is measurable difference in protest magnitude over time, with a rise in mobilization that peaks as mining operations near approval and initiation. Meanwhile, negotiation appears possible in each case, and is layered as a further option in addition to mobilization. Overall, the dissertation’s findings are critical for shaping the priorities and strategies of development practitioners concerned with empowering local communities to defend themselves.",1758891563,,Dissertations & Theses," Sussman, David DaughertySussmanDaughertyDavidSussman, David Daugherty",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3928238141 , 95553012 , 66569 , 9781339399706 , 3746536 , 3746536", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339399706, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1758891563?accountid=14496," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0619 Environmental Justice"," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0619 Environmental Justice",," 0550 Latin American Studies , 0601 International Relations , 0619 Environmental Justice"," Latin American Studies , International Relations , Environmental Justice"," Social sciences , Development , Environment , Migration , Mining , Peru , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Confrontation+or+negotiation%3F+Understanding+community+responses+to+mining+in+southern+Peru&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sussman%2C+David+Daugherty&amp;isbn=9781339399706&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Pedagogy, social transformation, and space: Toward a revolutionary critical pedagogy for space","Building on the work of Peter McLaren, Henri Lefebvre, and David Harvey, this dissertation develops a revolutionary critical pedagogy for space. I begin with a historical and theoretical survey of the roots critical pedagogy, a pedagogical orientation that is often called upon but rarely situated deeply. I then break down revolutionary critical pedagogy into seven components. I elaborate the dominant trends in the current social-political moment. I introduce two terms here, neoliberalism and the global class war. I argue that the former is a necessary but ultimately insufficient framework for understanding the present moment, and that the latter provides a necessary supplement because it looks at the global project of the restoration of capitalist class power after the circuit of socialist and national liberation struggles that transformed the globe between 1945-1979. This all entails an emphasis on the level of the global, but why is it that the global is so important, let alone space? I turn to these questions next, bringing in the “spatial turn” in education. I situate this work within the overall development of capitalism. I next turn to a particularly important spatial formation in the present: the city. Cities, I argue, are where the global contradictions of capitalism are most acute and concentrated; where capitalism is most vulnerable to disruption and overthrow. I bring in political movements and research on the “right to the city” as one way that revolutionary critical pedagogy can seize on such vulnerability. Finally, I return to the question of “pedagogy”, a move that not only spatializes educational theory but also educationalizes spatial theory. I do this by focusing in on Lefebvre’s theorization of the production of space as a revolutionary activity and his spatial framework of 1) representations of space; 2) representational spaces; and 3) spatial practice. I augment this framework with an educational triad of 1) learning; 2) studying; and 3) teaching. Claiming that this triad needs to be held in a precarious and dialectic relation, I read this triad through two pedagogical examples: the schoolhouse as curriculum and the 2015 Baltimore Rebellion as praxis.",1760593419,,Dissertations & Theses," Ford, Derek R.FordR.DerekFord, Derek R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3934523111 , 101704192 , 66569 , 9781339413273 , 10001068 , 10001068", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339413273, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1760593419?accountid=14496," 0366 Geography , 0422 Philosophy , 0515 Education"," 0366 Geography , 0422 Philosophy , 0515 Education"," 0366 Geography , 0422 Philosophy , 0515 Education",," 0366 Geography , 0422 Philosophy , 0515 Education"," Geography , Philosophy , Education"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Education , Critical pedagogy , Educational theory , Henri lefebvre , Marxism , Philosophy of education , Space",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Pedagogy%2C+social+transformation%2C+and+space%3A+Toward+a+revolutionary+critical+pedagogy+for+space&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ford%2C+Derek+R.&amp;isbn=9781339413273&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Neighbouring the Syrian War: Lebanon's Unique Case of Dysfunctional Functioning,"The ongoing war in Syria dramatically affects the neighbouring state of Lebanon. Lebanon has all the features of a fragile state that would find it difficult to cope with external shocks. So, what are the impacts of the Syrian conflict on Lebanon? How does its fragility contribute to that? How does Lebanon manage to avoid the spill-over of the war? The main source of Lebanon's fragility stems from severe sectarian divisions, public subordination to political movements, international interference, and deteriorating economic conditions. Consequently, the dissociation policy that the government adopted could not isolate Lebanon from the severe impacts of the conflict. This research discusses how Lebanon's fragility aggravates the consequences of the Syrian war. It explains how upheavals in a neighbouring country impact vulnerable countries as it studies state fragility from a theoretical perspective. Then, the research focuses on Lebanon's long history of fragility and how the Syrian war has exacerbated the situation. It examines the security, political, and institutional impacts of the war such as terrorist attacks, direct clashes, postponing parliamentary elections, and the presidential void. Furthermore, it studies the economic and social effects of the conflict that result from the pouring of refugees into Lebanon. Studying the characteristics of the fragile Lebanese state proves that these elements exacerbate the impacts of the war in Syria on the Lebanese political, social and economic systems. At the same time, sectarian divisions, international interference, the experience of the civil war, and political subordination are the reasons protecting Lebanon from slipping into a full-blown war.",1770444830,,Dissertations & Theses," Tarshishi, AlaaTarshishiAlaaTarshishi, Alaa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3971281811 , 97350282 , 66569 , 9781339511948 , 10020035 , 10020035", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781339511948, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1770444830?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0615 Political science , 0616 International law"," Middle Eastern history , Political science , International law"," Social sciences , Fragile State , Impacts of the Syrian War , Lebanon , Spillover Effect , State Fragility , Syrian Conflict",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Neighbouring+the+Syrian+War%3A%0ALebanon%27s+Unique+Case+of+Dysfunctional+Functioning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tarshishi%2C+Alaa&amp;isbn=9781339511948&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Studentification in china: changing geographies of haidian district, beijing","Processes of studentification encompass socio-economic, cultural and physical changes which are tied to seasonal population movements of university students. To date, most empirical investigations of studentification have tended to take place in Anglophone contexts. This thesis extends the lens of study to China, and shows the salience of the concept for understanding urban transformations which have unfolded since the introduction of a new state policy in 1999 for the expansion of higher education. Using the case study of Haidian District (Beijing), and focussing on Peking University students, the thesis makes original contributions to academic knowledge. First, it argued that the concept of studentification can be transposed to the Chinese context, and that social, cultural, economic and physical signifiers of studentification are evident in Beijing. Second, four main geographies of studentification are revealed, which concur with Smith and Hubbard s (2014) discussion of the co-existence of diverse geographies of studentification in the UK. These include: on-campus, university-managed dormitories (Yanyuan and Shaoyuan by Peking University); off-campus, university-managed dormitories (Wanliu, Changchunyuan/Changchunxinyuan, and Global Village); off-campus, Housing in Multiple Occupation (Haidianlu), and; off-campus, Purpose-built student accommodation (Wudaokou). By contrast to the UK, it is shown that all geographies of studentification are gated . Yet, differential residential and socio-cultural experiences are highlighted, in part, influenced by state regulations for Chinese students to reside within university-managed dormitories, or acquire permission to live off-campus; contrary to less-regulated accommodation patterns of International students. This division marks a conceptual difference between studentification in China and UK, with international students more aligned to stereotypical cultural/lifestyle traits of UK students (e.g. noise, partying), as opposed to Chinese counterparts residing in regulated (study-oriented) spaces on-campus. The thesis presents a redefined conceptualisation of studentification for pining down the diverse geographies of student housing in Beijing, to meet the differential demands of Chinese and international students in an expanded system of higher education.",1780277794,,Dissertations & Theses," Gu, HaoGuHaoGu, Hao",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018950601 , 103020792 , 101309 , 10079441 , 10079441 , https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/17707", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1780277794?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/2134/17707 , (UMI)AAI10079441 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Studentification+in+china%3A+changing+geographies+of+haidian+district%2C+beijing&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gu%2C+Hao&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Indignation as dissent?: the affective components of protest and democracy,"This thesis discusses the Indignados movement, which arose in Spain in 2011, in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. It makes the observation that the Indignados, and many other movements similar to it (like Occupy Wall Street, the Arab Spring, or the Global Justice Movement), gather large amounts of people, but are still struggling to be recognised as political subjects, as influential forces in the political environment. Many times, they are criticised for being too dispersed or too emotional, and lacking the cohesiveness to formulate concrete political aims. The Indignados can therefore be seen as challenging democracy and how political subjectivity is accorded, both in theory and practice. This leads this thesis to inquire into some of the theoretical underpinnings of democracy, and in particular political subjectivity. Its main research question is therefore: Can the Indignados spur a new reading of democracy?To further understand how we can conceive of the political subjectivity of an emotional and dispersed protest movement, this thesis turns to two approaches, social movement theory as well as deliberative democratic theory. After having examined extant literature on the matter, the thesis concludes that both of these approaches employ a distinct separation between emotion and reason, where political subjectivity is almost always hinged upon the latter. In addition, affect is seen as disjointed from signification, and therefore from political articulation. In order to circumvent this theoretical stalemate, this thesis turns to theories of radical democracy, and more specifically to the works of Ernesto Laclau. It argues that Laclau’s juxtaposition of Lacanian psychoanalysis and Derridian deconstruction opens up possibilities for a form of political subjectivity based on affect instead of reason alone. As such, Laclau’s theory of hegemony can shed light on those instances where affect and emotions play a central part in the creation of political subjectivity. In analysing Laclau’s theory, I respond to different analytical challenges that question the viability of explaining movements such as the Indignados through a theory of hegemony. Current observations point to that contemporary movements are not hegemonic (which place too much emphasis on verticality), but rather horizontal and networked. In order to address this critique, this thesis constructs a framework of the hegemonic project. This framework emphasises two commonly overlooked features of Laclau’s theory: the affective and transient nature of hegemony, which stresses the connection between affect and signification. Through two sets of empirical data – ethnographic fieldwork material and social media analysis – the thesis shows how the Indignados exhibit clear instances of verticality, albeit of an affective nature. This hegemonic, affective verticality speaks of two ways in which the movement can construct political subjectivity: viscerally (through unity in affective practices) and virtually (through social media).",1784056967,,Dissertations & Theses," Eklundh, EmmyEklundhEmmyEklundh, Emmy",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017579361 , 102699132 , 101309 , 10090416 , 10090416 , http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:271245", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784056967?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://www.manchester.ac.uk/escholar/uk-ac-man-scw:271245 , (UMI)AAI10090416 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Indignation+as+dissent%3F%3A+the+affective+components+of+protest+and+democracy&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Eklundh%2C+Emmy&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Evolution and learning in heterogeneous environments,"A real-world environment is complex and non-uniform, varying over space and time. This thesis demonstrates the impact of such environmental heterogeneity upon the ways in which organisms acquire information about the world, via a series of individual-based computational models that apply progressively more detailed forms of environmental structure to understand the causal impact of four distinct environmental factors: temporal variability; task complexity; population structure; and spatial heterogeneity. We define a baseline model, comprised of an evolving population of polygenic individuals that can follow three learning modes: innate behaviour, in which an organism acts according to its genetically-encoded traits; individual learning, in which an organism engages in trial-and-error to modify its inherited behaviours; and social learning, in which an individual mimics the behaviours of its peers. This model is used to show that environmental variability and task complexity affect the adaptive success of each learning mode, with social learning only arising as a dominant strategy in environments of median variability and complexity. Beyond a certain complexity threshold, individual learning is shown to be the sole dominant strategy. Social learning is shown to play a beneficial role following a sudden environmental change, contributing to the dissemination of novel traits in a population of poorly-adapted individuals. Introducing population structure in the form of a k-regular graph, we show that bounded and rigid neighbourhood relationships can have deleterious effects on a population, diminishing its evolutionary rate and equilibrium fitness, and, in some cases, preventing the population from crossing a fitness valley to a global optimum. A larger neighbourhood size is shown to increase the effectiveness of social learning, and results in a more rapid evolutionary convergence rate. The research subsequently focuses on spatially heterogeneous environments, proposing a new method of constructing an environment characterised by two key metrics derived from landscape ecology, “patchiness” and “gradient”. We show that spatial complexity slows the rate of genetic adaptation when movement is restricted, but can increase the rate of evolution for mobile individuals. Social learning is shown to be particularly beneficial within heterogeneous environments, particularly when mobility is restricted, suggesting that phenotypic plasticity may act as a substitute for mobility.",1784060998,,Dissertations & Theses," Jones, DanielJonesDanielJones, Daniel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4017583801 , 103020782 , 101309 , 10093461 , 10093461 , http://research.gold.ac.uk/15078/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1784060998?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://research.gold.ac.uk/15078/ , (UMI)AAI10093461 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Evolution+and+learning+in+heterogeneous+environments&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Jones%2C+Daniel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The world we desire is one we can create and care for together,"Written with a contemporary European context of economic, social and reproductive crisis in mind, this thesis presents research about, from and for social movements that struggle against precarity, austerity and capitalist accumulation. Based on accounts and analyses of feminist-autonomist militant practice and networks, this research project revolves around two terms: care and creativity. It maps out a historical-genealogical shift from a paradigm of creativity (reflected in neoliberal governance as well as in social movements of the decades before and after the millenium) to one oriented around care (reflected in the neo-communitarian policy as well as practices of commoning that arise with social and economic crisis in Europe). Structured into three broad sections on work, organisation and governance, the questions at stake here revolve around the possibilities and imaginaries of politics that affirm care and creativity in relation to one another. On the level of work, this means struggles within and against precarity, reproductive and illegalized work; on the level of organisation, it means relating the figure of the network to that of the care chain and the family, confronting new transnational forms of alliance and care; and on the level of governance, it is the relation between neoliberalism and its new communitarian forms that is in question. What the collectives, campaigns and networks constituting the ‘field’ of this research have in common is that they re-think the contemporary relations between autonomy and heteronomy, the global and the situated, as well as macro- and micropolitics. Dwelling on collective experiences and knowledges, this investigation takes care to articulate the dimensions of subjectivity, relation and association with those of economy and governance. Concerned and engaged with contexts of struggle and commoning in the face of crisis politics, precarity and dispersed sociality, a methodology of militant participatory-action research serves to map out contexts of practice in Spain, the UK and Argentina as of 2010-2013.",1788100594,,Dissertations & Theses," Zechner, ManuelaZechnerManuelaZechner, Manuela",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4018947401 , 103733192 , 101309 , 10090487 , 10090487 , http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/jspui/handle/123456789/9115", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1788100594?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/jspui/handle/123456789/9115 , (UMI)AAI10090487 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+world+we+desire+is+one+we+can+create+and+care+for+together&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Zechner%2C+Manuela&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Active citizenship, dissent and power: the cultural politics of young adult british muslims","We need to stop being afraid and realise that as individuals we have power and that power is the ability to use your own reason and just try and look beyond this. (Saif, 27, male, academic activist) This thesis presents findings from an ESRC-funded doctoral study on the cultural politics of young adult Muslims who participate in political and civic activism within British civil society. Based on ethnographic research in the Midlands area, it offers an empirically informed understanding of how these forms of activism relate to themes of political participation, citizenship, security and governance in Britain today. The thesis argues that the diverse mobilisations examined by the research collectively constitute a social movement to resist the marginalisation and stigmatisation of Muslim identities in a post 9/11 context. The war on terror, in response to the international crisis of militant Islam, has placed Muslim citizenship in many Western liberal democracies under fierce scrutiny, prompting uneasy and hard to resolve questions around issues of security, diversity, cohesion and national identity. In Britain, as in Europe, political and public responses to these questions have precipitated a climate of fear and suspicion around Muslims, rendering their citizenship contingent and precarious and undermining their ability to identify with the nation and participate in its political processes. This thesis reveals how young Muslim activists negotiate these challenges by engaging in a range of activities typical of social movements, not only in terms of distinctive modes of action but also with respect to their transformative social and political visions and imaginaries. Muslim activists engage in cultural politics to demand a more inclusive and post-national notion of citizenship, by seeking to turn negative Muslim differences into positive ones. Participants’ engagement in democratic processes through political repertoires commonly adopted by other progressive social movements challenges the moral panic engendered by the exceptionalism ascribed to Muslim identity politics. This thesis argues that these cultural politics constitute a British Muslim social movement to contest Islamophobia through resistance to two dominant forms of power in contemporary Western societies. Firstly, this movement is a response to the multiple technologies of power articulated by Foucault’s concept of ‘governmentality’, which are difficult to distinguish and confront due to their imperceptible and socially dispersed nature. Secondly, cultural politics is necessitated by direct threats of force that Foucault described as a ‘relationship of violence’ and which are discernible in the rise of the securitisation of citizenship in the wake of 9/11. The nature of resistance from Muslim activists suggests that their cultural politics are not only a strategic but also a less risky political response to both these prevailing forms of power. Foucault’s argument that the nature of power can be deciphered from the forms of resistance it provokes suggests responsive rather than reactive political strategies by young Muslims. The thesis concludes that these cultural politics represent forms of active citizenship premised on a more equal, participatory and radically democratic social contract than nationalist and neoliberal forms of governance presently concede.",1794984356,,Dissertations & Theses," Mustafa, AnisaMustafaAnisaMustafa, Anisa",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4082604451 , 103733082 , 101309 , 10121851 , 10121851 , http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/30533/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1794984356?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/30533/ , (UMI)AAI10121851 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Active+citizenship%2C+dissent+and+power%3A+the+cultural+politics+of+young+adult+british+muslims&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mustafa%2C+Anisa&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Emergent movements: the role of embodiment and somatics in british contemporary dance,"This thesis explores somatic practices as a social movement by focusing on the relationship between embodiment, somatics and contemporary dance practices. It looks specifically to Body-Mind Centering® (BMC®) and traces an ethnographic history of the practice examining it as a post-modern western somatic method forming part of an international social movement. The research is grounded on post-structuralist dance anthropology and analyses BMC® as a “socially constructed movement system” (Grau 1993). Through experimentation, the somatic movement cultivates bodily awareness and an embodied sense of self. The thesis points to the ways in which the emphasis on embodiment may form a key component in this social movement and its relation to British somatic-informed dance. While providing the conceptual and historic context for experimentation in contemporary dance in Britain since the 70s, the thesis illustrates that New, and later, Independent Dance artists drew from BMC® as well as other somatic practices. It argues that the exploration of embodiment as a human attribute and lived phenomenon from a somatic perspective gave rise to a culturally distinct discourse of practice, known today as somatic-informed dance. It works to illustrate the nature of the new pedagogical approach that emerged and, specifically, the way this aspect of contemporary dance evolved as a result of the emphasis on embodiment and the somatic influence. To do so, the thesis identifies and analyses distinct principles and pedagogic tools employed through an anthropological perspective and ethnographic, historical and practice-led research methods. Further illustrating the way the concept of embodiment is understood in somatic informed dance pedagogy, it critically examines the claim that embodiment processes may re-educate dualist perceptions. It, thereby, argues that it is only in the experience of integration in the lived moment that the problem of dualism might be challenged. Through an investigation of lineage, the thesis situates BMC® and somaticinformed contemporary dance practice within the socio-cultural, artistic, conceptual and philosophical context in which they developed. Pointing to the parallel expansion of scholarly and artistic interest in embodiment over the past five decades, it demonstrates a permeability of bodies, places, ideas and culturally constructed movement systems. Overall, the thesis is underpinned by a critical engagement with the position that embodiment and experience form the existential ground for culture and self (distilled in Csordas’ 1994a), offering an analysis of BMC® informed dance practice as another source of data shedding new light to this insight. Capturing a moment in dance history with a synchronic investigation (Sahlins 1998), this research works to further contribute towards an understanding of a diachronic property of the formation of cultures. In line with Csordas’ position, it suggests that given their distinct approach to experientially gained corporeal knowledge and awareness, the emergence of ‘culturally constructed movement systems’ such as BMC® and somatic informed contemporary dance form a potential illustration of the way culture is existentially grounded on embodiment and experience.",1807095358,,Dissertations & Theses," Giotaki, G.GiotakiG.Giotaki, G.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4129485741 , 103733182 , 101309 , 10134663 , 10134663 , http://curve.coventry.ac.uk/open/items/dddf2f58-70b8-4c9b-a3b8-8b4308208f50/1", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1807095358?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://curve.coventry.ac.uk/open/items/dddf2f58-70b8-4c9b-a3b8-8b4308208f50/1 , (UMI)AAI10134663 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Emergent+movements%3A+the+role+of+embodiment+and+somatics+in+british+contemporary+dance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Giotaki%2C+G.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Improving the quality of teaching and learning in mauritian primary schools: the role of learner-centred pedagogy in current educational reform,"This study examines the international transfer of learner-centred pedagogy as a means to improve the quality of teaching and learning in developing countries, with special reference to detailed fieldwork in the Small Island Developing State (SIDS) of Mauritius. Specifically, this' case study critically examines a primary schooling initiative in Mauritius called 'Zones d'Education Prioritaires' (ZEP). This education reform was conceptualised in the light of international agendas calling for a Quality Education For All. Such initiatives often promote social justice for marginalised children through the integration of learner-centred pedagogy in schools and classrooms. This research investigates efforts to shift from formalistic to learner-centred pedagogy in the ZEP Initiative, with reference to the history of Mauritian education reforms, the evolution of ZEP policy, alid a detailed and empirically grounded case study of one ZEP school. The study explores the successes achieved, along with the challenges and barriers encountered, in implementing learner-centred pedagogy in the Mauritian context. Fieldwork engaged directly with ZEP Initiative staff at the Mauritius Ministry of Education and Human Resources, support organisations present at ZEP schools, ZEP teachers, pupils, school administrators, and communities. The findings suggest that there is slow, but unsustainable, movement towards learnercentred pedagogy in the ZEP Initiative. Progress is restricted by hierarchical social norms that have perpetuated competition in the country's formalistic education system. The study's major findings indicate that sustainable progress may depend upon greater practical attention to quality-oriented policies and processes that underlie learnercentred pedagogy. In concluding, the study explores the implications of the research for the case study school, for the ZEP Initiative, for related government policy and practice, and for the theoretical literature on the international transfer of learner-centred pedagogy and educational reform processes in SIDS.",1810881524,,Dissertations & Theses," Colin, Mindy LeeColinLeeMindyColin, Mindy Lee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4145039341 , 103890502 , 101309 , 10136965 , 10136965", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1810881524?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," (UMI)AAI10136965 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Improving+the+quality+of+teaching+and+learning+in+mauritian+primary+schools%3A+the+role+of+learner-centred+pedagogy+in+current+educational+reform&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Colin%2C+Mindy+Lee&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Living transnational: citizenship, identity and home among south african former immigrants and refugees in botswana since 1957","This thesis analyses how South African former immigrants and refugees in Botswana have established transnational connections between their country of origin and their country of migration since 1957. The thesis develops across two main and overlapping strands: transnationalism and citizenship. Considering transnationalism, it argues that the migrants that have crossed the border from South Africa to Botswana (economic immigrants, refugees and freedom fighters) have established multi-layered transnational connections that stretch from their personal identity to the economic and political fields. These connections are contextualised within the broader labour migration movement in southern Africa and the anti-apartheid struggle. Furthermore, these links have allowed migrants to create a sense of community in solidarity with the struggle against white minority rule and to create spaces to set their survival strategies in order for them to decide, among a range of opportunities, what was most convenient to them. In this way, Botswana’s role as a transit corridor for refugees assumed different social meanings: a route to the northern territories of the continent, a temporary solution, a permanent settlement, a passage to return to South Africa for trained saboteurs. Considering citizenship, the thesis shows that South African migrants have conceptualised citizenship taking into account their transnational links but also Botswana’s processes of nation-building and citizenship construction. Migrants’ understanding of citizenship not always reflects Botswana’s official discourse. Because of this, migrants’ process of integration intertwined with their ways to cope with perceptions of discrimination and exclusion that have emerged in Botswana as a result of the nation-building process that privileges the eight Tswana tribes over minorities and naturalised citizens. This thesis is based on original research which drew on a number of methods including archival research and oral histories. It is also interdisciplinary in focus, drawing mostly on literature from sociology, history and migration studies, but also anthropology, geography and international relations. It thus contributes to debates on transnationalism, on citizenship in Botswana and on the country’s role in the South African liberation struggle.",1810887846,,Dissertations & Theses," Spano, ElisabettaSpanoElisabettaSpano, Elisabetta",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4145038111 , 103030282 , 101309 , 10134468 , 10134468 , http://hdl.handle.net/1842/15744", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1810887846?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/1842/15744 , (UMI)AAI10134468 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Living+transnational%3A+citizenship%2C+identity+and+home+among+south+african+former+immigrants+and+refugees+in+botswana+since+1957&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Spano%2C+Elisabetta&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Permaculture as farming practice and international grassroots network: A multidisciplinary study,"Agroecology is a promising alternative to industrial agriculture, with the potential to avoid the negative social and ecological consequences of input-intensive production. Transitioning to agroecological production is, however, a complex project that requires action from all sectors of society – from producers and consumers, and from scientists and grassroots networks. Grassroots networks and movements are increasingly regarded as agents of change, with a critical role to play in agroecological transition as well as broader socio-environmental transformation. Permaculture is one such movement, with a provocative perspective on agriculture and human-environment relationships more broadly. Despite its relatively broad international distribution and high public profile, permaculture has remained relatively isolated from scientific research. This investigation helps to remedy that gap by assessing permaculture through three distinct projects. A systematic review offers a quantitative and qualitative assessment of the permaculture literature, through the lens of agroecology. This review is organized around a layered conception of permaculture as design, practice, movement, and worldview. The major points of our analysis are as follows: (1) principles and topics largely complement and even extend the agroecological literature; (2) distinctive approaches to perennial polyculture, water management, and agroecosystem configuration suggest promising avenues of inquiry; (3) discussions of practice consistently underplay the complexity, challenges, and risks that producers face in developing diversified and integrated production systems. The second project, an international web survey, with over 700 responses from over 40 countries, provides a first look at permaculture as an international grassroots network. The survey examined self-identified roles of permaculture participants and explored the relationships between those roles and socio-demographic factors race, gender, and socioeconomic status. The influence of structural factors on participant roles was examined by including multidimensional national indices of development, inequality, and ecosystem vitality, for the 45 countries in the sample. Results showed the participation of women at or above parity (53%), while participation by race showed a white supermajority (96%). Multivariate regression demonstrated that race, gender, and socioeconomic status are shaping participation in distinct ways and that each of these variables interacts with structural factors. The third project provides the first systematic investigation of the agricultural sector in permaculture, using innovative methods to gather enterprise-level data at 48 self-identified permaculture farms in the US. This project develops a preliminary typology of permaculture farms based on livelihoods, and assesses the relationship between farm diversification and labor efficiency. Multilevel modeling shows that both diversification and involvement with permaculture increase returns to labor, but may interfere with each other, and that tree crops have significantly higher returns to labor when integrated with animal production systems.",1815141497,,Dissertations & Theses," Ferguson, JeffreyFergusonJeffreyFerguson, Jeffrey",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4164655051 , 107456242 , 66569 , 9781369064971 , 10151794 , 10151794", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781369064971, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1815141497?accountid=14496," 0285 Agronomy , 0473 Agriculture , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," 0285 Agronomy , 0473 Agriculture , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," 0285 Agronomy , 0473 Agriculture , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0640 Sustainability",," 0285 Agronomy , 0473 Agriculture , 0477 Environmental Studies , 0640 Sustainability"," Agronomy , Agriculture , Environmental Studies , Sustainability"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Agroecology , Diversified farming systems , Grassroots networks , Permaculture , Sustainability transitions",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Permaculture+as+farming+practice+and+international+grassroots+network%3A+A+multidisciplinary+study&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ferguson%2C+Jeffrey&amp;isbn=9781369064971&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Reading the golden city: Spatial representation and urban semiotics in the work of Ivan Vladislavić,"With the fall of apartheid in 1994 came the erosion of previously demarcated social spaces throughout South Africa, a process which necessitated a drastic reimagining of South African national identity. Since this transition, South Africa has legislated the collapse of apartheid and the attendant reorganization of movements of people through urban landscapes while simultaneously negotiating its re-entry into international networks of commerce and cultural exchange. There are, however, numerous ways in which literary works have challenged the narrative of the “rainbow nation” by pointing to how South African urbanscapes physically manifest various anxieties of post-apartheid subjectivity. To illuminate this interaction, this thesis explores the interrelationship between formations of national identity and fictionalized representations of urban space in the works of Ivan Vladislavić. Vladislavić is an acclaimed yet surprisingly under theorized South African author whose work gestures to the conceptual challenge of rethinking the relationship between subjectivity and social space. Vladislavić's characters are frequently architects or city planners; his narratives focus on the symbology of the contemporary cityscape, enabling him to illustrate how, in the specific context of Johannesburg (the setting for each of his major works), imagining and representing space is foundational to understanding and influencing the material reality responsible for controlling human movement. The central contention of this thesis is that Vladislavić’s novels The Restless Supermarket , The Folly , and The Exploded View , provide a critique of urban development discourse by deconstructing discursive systems that produce static, closed, and diagrammatic spatial representations and in doing so reveal key ideological foundations of apartheid that both pre-existed and currently survive its formal regime. Additionally, his novels Double Negative and Portrait with Keys provide examples of alternative subjectivities whose spatial imaginations offer different vantage points for mapping the built environment that remain changeable and open to alterity and that therefore suggest a potential ethical response to existing inside/outside social demarcations that are currently spatially realized in South Africa.",1819570324,,Dissertations & Theses," Hawkins, FraserHawkinsFraserHawkins, Fraser",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4182904631 , 107795162 , 66569 , 9781369102031 , 10155118 , 10155118", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015, 9781369102031, English, English,,2015,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1819570324?accountid=14496," 0316 African literature , 0654 South African Studies"," 0316 African literature , 0654 South African Studies"," 0316 African literature , 0654 South African Studies",," 0316 African literature , 0654 South African Studies"," African literature , South African Studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Apartheid , Ivan Vladislavić , National identity , Rainbow nation , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Reading+the+golden+city%3A+Spatial+representation+and+urban+semiotics+in+the+work+of+Ivan+Vladislavi%C4%87&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hawkins%2C+Fraser&amp;isbn=9781369102031&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Vernácula modernidad. influencia de la arquitectura vernácula mediterránea en la aparición y desarrollo de la arquitectura moderna durante el primer tercio del siglo XX,"The thematic and conceptual framework developed in the PhD thesis has led us to consider the influence of traditional Mediterranean architecture on different European social and cultural contexts during the first decades of the 20th century. Our objective has been to determine the role played by this architectural style in the emergence and evolution of architecture in the Modernist Movement. The theoretical-critical backdrop that we have developed rests mainly on the basis of the analysis and assessment of the documentary sources, considering the diversity of individuals who were decisive in this broad artistic and intellectual process as well as the social and cultural contexts in which these ideas originated and developed. The cultural contexts of Central Europe and the Mediterranean have been analysed. In the first case we analysed the proliferation of diverse reform and transformation movements in the beginning of 1900’s, mainly in Austria and Germany. In addition to these more general contexts, we studied the particular case of Le Corbusier, because of his importance at an international level and the crucial role he played in the promotion of the Modernist Movement. In the Mediterranean context we are dealing with the impact that the Modernist Movement has had on Italian and Spanish architecture since the 1920s. The conclusion of the doctoral thesis jointly tackles the issues referred to above, so as to establish a critical balance in regards to the role that Mediterranean vernacular architecture played in the emergence and subsequent development of Modernism in architecture.

El objetivo ha sido determinar el papel ejercido por esta arquitectura en el surgimiento y evolución de la arquitectura del Movimiento Moderno. El cuadro crítico teórico que hemos desarrollado se ha construido fundamentalmente a partir del análisis y valoración de las fuentes documentales, teniendo en cuenta la diversidad de personalidades individuales que protagonizaron este amplio proceso artístico e intelectual, así como la variedad de contextos sociales y culturales en las que estas ideas se fraguaron y desarrollaron. Se han analizado los contextos culturales de Centroeuropa y del Mediterráneo. En el primer caso analizamos la proliferación en torno a 1900 de diversos movimientos de reforma y transformación, principalmente en Austria y Alemania. Junto a estos contextos más generales, estudiamos el caso particular de Le Corbusier, por su importancia a nivel internacional y el papel de adalid que jugó en la difusión del Movimiento Moderno. En el contexto mediterráneo abordamos la repercusión que el Movimiento Moderno tuvo en la arquitectura de Italia y España desde la década de 1920.

Tongzhi and ku-er arose during a period of liberalisation that permitted expression to the to the previously inexpressible, in this case, issues surrounding unconventional sexual identity. The growth of these movements was inspired by an increasing awareness among the sexually marginalised in Taiwan, of the developments that had occurred in the West regarding sexual identity. The newly tolerant political climate enabled a demand for previously unobtainable cultural material to be supplied, leading to a demand for translators of this material. This thesis concerns itself with the role of translation in the formation and evolution of tongzhi and ku-er movements through fiction. In the history of literature dealing with same sex desire, the rise of tongzhi and ku-er literature reflects a variety of social, political and literary trends, the international and politically rebellious elements that characterized tongzhi and ku-er identities. Translation, by turn is an important component that brings in foreign influence to tongzhi and ku-er literature, whereby the literature itself translates aspects from Western sources in a way that is characterized as ‘translocal’. Despite the close ties of tongzhi and ku-er literature with global and local political movements and translation, very little has been written on the subject of tongzhi and ku-er translation. The two translated texts selected for analysis, Angelwings: Contemporary Queer Fiction from Taiwan and Notes of a Desolate Man engage with the aforementioned global and local frameworks.

It examines five significant topics: abortion, lesbianism, pornography, prostitution, and rape, all of which were campaigned on by feminists in each country. There has been a distinct lack of historical comparative works on the two movements, and few attempts to compare their discussions and activism on sexuality, which has resulted in a limited view of each movement, something this thesis aims to rectify. Using written grassroots sources, published primary material, and oral history interviews, it argues there were broad similarities between the two movements, but differences in the scope, shape, and progression of their campaigns as a result of national, cultural, and social factors. This study covers the period when each movement was at its height but also when it began to wane in activism, and explores how each approached sexuality in public campaigns and discussions. Examining multiple topics allows a deeper comparison of the feminist approach to sexuality, including: how they dealt with outside organisations; the significance of personal experience; and connections between class, sexuality, and the limits of ‘sexual liberation’. By providing the first historical comparative analysis of the movements’ approaches, this project shows there were many parallel ideas between the two as result of similar origins and outside influences. Yet it was national events and contexts that converted these ideas on politicising the personal into distinctive feminist activism, and a ‘global sisterhood’ manifested differently on each side of the Channel.",1827870051,,Dissertations & Theses," Gurun, AnnaGurunAnnaGurun, Anna",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4211382641 , 103733052 , 101309 , 10179399 , 10179399 , http://hdl.handle.net/10588/23072114-94b9-412a-88a6-64f536725a13", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827870051?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/10588/23072114-94b9-412a-88a6-64f536725a13 , (UMI)AAI10179399 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Second-wave+feminist+approaches+to+sexuality+in+britain+and+france%2C+c.1970-c1983&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Gurun%2C+Anna&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Gendered migrations: an exploration of the influence of migration on polish women's perception of gender roles,"Following the expansion of the European Union (EU) in 2004, migration from the new Accession 8 EU Member States to the United Kingdom (UK) has been identified as one of the most significant international migratory movements to the UK in recent times. The largest member of these states is Poland and the UK has been the most common destination for Polish migrants post 2004. Arguably, there is limited literature that focuses solely on women; indeed, women migrants were invisible until the 1970s. In relation to A8 migration, gender and gender roles are an under-researched area. The aim of this thesis is to fill this gap and offer new insights with regard to the influence of the migratory experience on Polish women’s lives and the way they negotiate their gender roles through migration. This thesis contributes new and unique evidence to the debates surrounding migration, gender, Polish women and comparative social policy, in particular with regard to the role of networks in migration; enduring and new push and pull factors; the icon of ‘Matka Polka’ and work-life balance. Through the use of 32 qualitative in-depth semi-structured interviews with Polish migrant women resident in two countries – the UK and Poland, this thesis considers the factors that motivate the initial and any subsequent ‘return’ international migratory movements undertaken by Polish women between the UK and Poland. Additionally, the ways in which Polish migrant women (re)negotiate their gender roles in regard to paid work and informal familial care across time and space are explored. It is concluded that motivations for migration as well as motives to remain in the host country are often related to economic factors and the availability of migrant networks. It is shown that the migratory process may indeed influence women’s perception of gender roles which seem to be re-evaluated post migration.",1827871211,,Dissertations & Theses," Duda-Mikulin, Ewa A.Duda-MikulinA.EwaDuda-Mikulin, Ewa A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4211388171 , 103733232 , 101309 , 10180139 , 10180139 , http://usir.salford.ac.uk/35634/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827871211?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://usir.salford.ac.uk/35634/ , (UMI)AAI10180139 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Gendered+migrations%3A+an+exploration+of+the+influence+of+migration+on+polish+women%27s+perception+of+gender+roles&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Duda-Mikulin%2C+Ewa+A.&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Hegemony and counter-hegemony in the agri-food system in thailand (1990-2014),"This thesis has two main objectives: (1) to provide a critical political economy study of local-global interlinkages and structural problems of the current agri-food system, using a case study of Thailand; and (2) to explore the possibilities that the current agri-food system can be transformed towards more socially and ecologically sustainable paths. With these two objectives in mind, the thesis asks the central research question: ""How have hegemonic and counter-hegemonic forces shaped the agri-food system in Thailand (1990 to 2014)?"" The thesis uses a combined neo-Marxist and Gramscian theoretical framework, as well as English and Thai primary and secondary sources. Overall, 87 interviews from 7 provinces in the North, Central, South and Northeastern regions of Thailand are used in this thesis. The thesis argues four main points: (1) that the mainstream agri-food system in Thailand has been shaped to aid capital accumulation by domestic and transnational hegemonic forces, and is sustained through hegemonic agri-food production-distribution, governance structures and ideational order; (2) that the Thai sustainable agriculture and land reform movements' counter-hegemonic ideas, production-distribution practices, and governance structures have managed to influence the agri-food system in Thailand and offer alternatives to certain extents; (3) that hegemonic forces have many measures to co-opt dissent, alternative and reformist forces into hegemonic structures; and (4) that counter-hegemony should be seen as an un-linear ongoing process over a long period of time, where predominantly counter-hegemonic forces may at times retain some hegemonic elements. The threat of co-optation suggests that counter-hegemonic forces need to continually refine and develop clear ideas and practices in order to guard against co-optation. The thesis makes six main original contributions to knowledge. First, it brings new empirical information from the Thai case study into existing literatures on the corporate agri-food system and agrarian political economy. Second, the thesis brings new empirical information from Thailand into existing literatures on alternative agri-food and agrarian movements. Third, the research extends neo-Marxist and Gramscian theoretical perspectives in the study of the agri-food system. Fourth, the dissertation provides new perspectives as well as recent data on Thai agrarian development and social movements. Fifth, the work provides new perspectives as well as recent data on practices and discourses of Thai localism. Sixth and finally, the thesis provides a new perspective on polarised politics in Thailand. Empirical exploration of the agri-food system in Thailand supports the thesis' argument that transformative change in the agri-food system can appropriately be seen as an un-linear process over a long period of time, which challenges agri-food studies from the Marxist tradition which tend to focus on ""crisis and change"". Through the combined neo-Marxist and Gramscian theoretical approach, the thesis suggests the importance of counter-hegemonic struggles at ideational and material levels, and that social movements do not necessarily have to resemble stereotypical images of politicised, structured, and leftist national movements. Moreover, by providing new perspectives on Thai localism and polarised politics in Thailand, particularly how cross-class alliances can further or frustrate counter-hegemonic movements, this thesis points to the importance of analysing social movements in relation to established political authority.",1857843573,,Dissertations & Theses," Chiengkul, PrapimhanChiengkulPrapimhanChiengkul, Prapimhan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4299308961 , 103733252 , 101309 , 10135854 , 10135854 , http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/73929/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1857843573?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/73929/ , (UMI)AAI10135854 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Hegemony+and+counter-hegemony+in+the+agri-food+system+in+thailand+%281990-2014%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chiengkul%2C+Prapimhan&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Social mobilisations, politics and society in contemporary kyrgyzstan","This dissertation is about social mobilizations in rural Kyrgyzstan from 2010-2015. Following a constructivist approach, I aim to answer a puzzling question in regard to multiple but rarely sustainable protests in this global periphery: Under what conditions can provisional episodes of mobilization be transformed into sustained mobilization? In particularly, I consider Eric Hirsch’s insight that the commitment of participants of mobilization to the cause is formed within collective instances, i.e. ‘group processes’, and I employ it in the Kyrgyzstani context of generalized distrust and discredited corrupt politics. I explore the conditions in which participants of episodes of mobilization create trust in organizers and into the cause of mobilization. I investigate these conditions in two case studies: one concerns a fragmented labour force at a state-owned gas and oil company in which, in the course of four years, workers succeeded to empower themselves as a collective actor within the group processes of collective learning and collective decision-making. The second tells a story about a fragmented rural community that goes against mining operations but sees the decline of an initially successful mobilization within group processes of monitoring. These findings point to the presence of a specific ‘pre-condition’ for any lasting mobilization: trust between organizers and participants of episodes of mobilization must be established in the process of monitoring the commitment to collective interests. With this insight I contribute to the literature on social movements and mobilizations that tends to take commitment and trust as pre-established resources. Furthermore, this work intervenes in the ongoing discussion on social change in the former Soviet Union. First, my observations of the difficult formation of protest groups lead, surprisingly, to the conclusion that the weak state produces a weak society. Second, due to the fragmented and localized nature of these mobilizations, social and political change in Kyrgyzstan is most likely to occur at the local level.",1896107433,,Dissertations & Theses," Doolotkeldieva, AselDoolotkeldievaAselDoolotkeldieva, Asel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4322233735 , 103112902 , 101309 , 10596173 , 10596173 , http://hdl.handle.net/10871/21665", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1896107433?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://hdl.handle.net/10871/21665 , (UMI)AAI10596173 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Social+mobilisations%2C+politics+and+society+in+contemporary+kyrgyzstan&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Doolotkeldieva%2C+Asel&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Food sovereignty and the via campesina in mexico and ecuador: class dynamics, struggles for autonomy and the politics of resistance","This thesis analyses the class dynamics, politics, and ideology of food sovereignty in Mexico and Ecuador. It argues that engagement with class dynamics within the Via Campesina, the world's preeminent transnational agrarian movement struggling for food sovereignty, is essential for the construction of 'unity in diversity' necessary to challenge the neoliberal food regime. It interrogates the claim made by the movement and its proponents of a 'unified people of the land' to show that the food sovereignty project currently underrepresents rural labour and producers of cash crops. It also shows that struggles of the landed peasantry for autonomy from and within the market can successfully resist the accelerated forces of proletarianisation, dispossession and immiseration that characterise much of the rural South in the neoliberal era. Autonomous struggles are the foundation of peasant production and reproduction strategies in Mexico and Ecuador today and are the basis from which food sovereignty's productive, political and ideological alternatives to neoliberalism must be developed. However, state-peasant movement relations are central to the construction of counter-hegemony. So too are peasant organisations' internal structures, their modes of representation between leaders and bases, and alliance building and conflict with other subaltern groups. These factors are critical in determining whether, and to what extent, the food sovereignty movement is able to transform neoliberal food and agricultural policies in favour of sustainable, small-scale peasant production guided by concerns for social and environmental justice rather than those of capital accumulation.",1913432577,,Dissertations & Theses," Henderson, Thomas PaulHendersonPaulThomasHenderson, Thomas Paul",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4323005497 , 103733372 , 101309 , 10613340 , 10613340 , http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/22778/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1913432577?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.soas.ac.uk/22778/ , (UMI)AAI10613340 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Food+sovereignty+and+the+via+campesina+in+mexico+and+ecuador%3A+class+dynamics%2C+struggles+for+autonomy+and+the+politics+of+resistance&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Henderson%2C+Thomas+Paul&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Constructing maritime geographies: the pragmatic mobility of senegalese fishermen,"Senegalese fishermen have significantly expanded their mobility into the eastern Atlantic Ocean since the early 1980s. Fishermen have been crossing international maritime borders and organising long sea journeys, in part as a response to the decrease in fishing resources in Senegalese waters. From the early 2000s, they began carrying West African migrants on the maritime routes from Senegal to Spain, diversifying into irregular maritime migration or ‘people smuggling’. Fishermen’s fishing techniques and the migration flows they have facilitated are well documented. We have a good understanding, too, of the push-and-pull factors shaping these maritime migration patterns. Thus far, the social and political meanings of fishermen’s maritime mobility and cross-border movements have been comparatively neglected. This thesis argues that these mobility patterns are connected, revealing links between regional fisheries and mobilities and international migration flows that create distinctive maritime geographies. Drawing on participant observations and narratives collected in 69 in-depth interviews, my analysis explores the ways in which power and knowledge shape the at-sea experiences of Senegalese fishermen. For them, mobility is more than a response to the decrease in fish resources. By deploying their mobility, fishermen seek to recover control over their maritime and social environments. To map the maritime geographies this mobility co-creates, I examine three spaces. First, I chart the social and political mechanisms of fishermen’s mobility in Senegal, examining the gendered and local meanings of their movements. Second, I examine these mechanisms at the regional level – at the Senegal–Mauritania border and in the waters off Guinea and Guinea-Bissau. Finally, I track fishermen’s routes to the Canary Islands. By attending to fishermen’s accounts, I demonstrate the many ways in which they appropriate the ocean space, shape the geographies of maritime borderlands and rationalise their navigation. I reveal how their maritime mobility opens up multiple opportunities for fishermen to negotiate with – and reshape – the power relations that structure their social, political and natural environments.",1916250513,,Dissertations & Theses," Hallaire, JulietteHallaireJulietteHallaire, Juliette",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4323141845 , 103733222 , 101309 , 10625891 , 10625891 , http://eprints.keele.ac.uk/2986/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2015,, English, English,,2015,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2015,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1916250513?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://eprints.keele.ac.uk/2986/ , (UMI)AAI10625891 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Constructing+maritime+geographies%3A+the+pragmatic+mobility+of+senegalese+fishermen&amp;issn=&amp;date=2015-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hallaire%2C+Juliette&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Democracy Dispossessed: Land, Law &amp;amp; the Politics of Redistribution in South Africa","This dissertation concerns the history of land politics in South Africa and, equally, land as a vehicle for understanding the transition from apartheid to the post-apartheid order. In 2004, after a decade in power, the ANC government’s failure to carry out widespread land reform began to test the country’s democratic possibilities. In the lead up to that year’s national election, social movements urged landless people to boycott the polls and occupy land instead as part of a “No Land! No Vote!” campaign. With this clash as its entry point for analysis, this dissertation examines historical factors that have shaped South Africa’s neoliberal democracy and prospects for redistribution. It offers insights into some of the most significant questions facing the country: What is the historical relationship between land dispossession, citizenship, and politics in South Africa? And why, well into the Mbeki years, was the country unable, or unwilling, to reckon with it? Broad in scope, this dissertation examines a number of institutions that shaped the politics of land, economic development, and citizenship in South Africa over the last century. It is particularly focused on period of the 1940s-2004, encompassing the apartheid era and the first ten years of democracy. I begin by recasting the history of apartheid pass laws in the mid-twentieth century, widening the scope beyond their role in containing labor mobility and controlling access to cities. I show how vagrancy laws were one piece of a continuum that stretched through jails and prisons to rural plantations, supplying labor to farms and subsidizing agricultural development. Later chapters examine how, beginning in the 1970s, the World Bank and other international institutions helped shape the contours of land and housing policies and the relationship between states and citizens. My research also shows how, during the apartheid transition and through the Mandela and Mbeki administrations, private prisons and harsh criminal justice reforms became integral parts of neoliberal economic development. This dissertation weaves together the history that has shaped South Africa’s ‘dispossessed democracy’ and concludes with a discussion of the implications for social movements and political change.",1739021370,,Dissertations & Theses," Alexander, AmandaAlexanderAmandaAlexander, Amanda",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3884043421 , 100564002 , 66569 , 9781339268682 , 3737485 , 3737485", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339268682, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1739021370?accountid=14496," 0331 African history , 0654 South African Studies"," 0331 African history , 0654 South African Studies"," 0331 African history , 0654 South African Studies",," 0331 African history , 0654 South African Studies"," African history , South African Studies"," Social sciences , Citizenship , Democracy , Economic development , Land , Prisons , South Africa",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Democracy+Dispossessed%3A+Land%2C+Law+%26amp%3B+the+Politics+of+Redistribution+in+South+Africa&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Alexander%2C+Amanda&amp;isbn=9781339268682&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Competing for attention: A comparative study of social movements and news media in abortion debates,"Why do some social movements in abortion debates get more attention from the news media than others?

A flood of recent novels, memoirs and nonfiction books make this activist, productive, expressive kind of consumption their central theme (and in the case of several of the memoirs, their organizing conceit). The authors of these works have suggested interesting expansions of the ethical role not just of commodity consumption but of media consumption as well: the imaginative literature of ethical consumption models ethical consumption for its readers, and it sees itself shaping attitudes about consumption that will in turn shape economic, social and environmental realities in the world. The ambition of that project (and the enthusiasm with which readers have taken it up) lends a sense of urgency to my own. My dissertation looks at representations of ethical consumption in this growing body of imaginative literature in order to understand how and on what terms it intervenes in consumption. I argue that the language and forms that these texts use to imagine ethical consumption matter: that they privilege particular perspectives, communicate ideological investments, and shape the interpretation of events in ways that inflect their interpretation of both the practice of ethical consumption and the real-world problems that ethical consumption responds to.

Concerned that surging civil unrest at home was the prelude to a left-wing revolution reminiscent of the recent Sandinista victory in nearby Nicaragua, the officers appointed a broad-based civil-military junta and pledged to respond to popular demands for social, economic, and political reforms. Faced with the dual threat of structural reforms supported by reformists in the military and the US government, and a left-wing opposition movement intent on leading a popular revolution, military and private sector rightists organized a political-paramilitary counterrevolutionary response with material support and advice procured through transnational networks of right-wing activists and organizations. The Salvadoran right successfully undermined the government’s reform program while strengthening the position of officers who favored a violent purge of the opposition. Salvadoran rightists took their fight to the United States as well, where they championed their cause as quintessentially American in its defense of free market economic values and its commitment to fighting communism imposed from without and within. Though overshadowed by the Iran-Contra affair, US policy toward El Salvador’s conflict was critical to defining Washington’s Latin America agenda during the final phase of the Cold War and to efforts by the Reagan White House to navigate foreign policy autonomously amidst pressures from different currents of the Republican Party.

This takes place through electronic health records as well as more generalized sources. The uptake of social media is contributing to an innovation in patient centered healthcare: information and support on a global scale is coming not only from the formal healthcare system, but also within online social networks. Today, through computer-mediated interactions, patients are not only seeking information, they are curating and sharing information. Subsequently, patients are also creating information, establishing a novel ecosystem of engagement that has the potential to disrupt the current healthcare system. This dissertation explores an online health community, BCSM (which stands for “breast cancer social media”), established using Twitter, a largely public and searchable social media platform. Drawing primarily from social network theory, disruptive innovation, and ecological systems theory, this research identifies essential characteristics within the community that may inform future development and support for patient centered healthcare. To conduct this research, a blended approach of netnography – referring to the approach of ethnography applied to the study of online cultures and communities – and in-depth interviews with BCSM participants were employed. Data collected via interviews and tweets using the hashtag #bcsm provide evidence of clinical support, emotional support, information sharing, and knowledge translation. Underpinning this activity is the opportunity to associate not only with peers, but also with individuals of varying roles (including patients, providers, advocates, researchers, and caregivers). As evidenced by the data collected, educational opportunities flow in both directions. This work contributes to the larger corpus of health-related literature in the identification and naming of a significant community element that has seen little focused attention: cross-peer engagement, a term used to highlight the interaction amongst individuals of differing status, ability, or rank. This research also documents the formation of microspurs, defined as relationships that form as a result of community participation. These come in many forms and range from expanding a personal support network to participation in federal policy work. Findings suggest that the future of healthcare will not revolve around hospitals and bounded systems. Instead, patients will demand an expanded set of entry points for health information sharing, knowledge transfer, condition management, and general support.",1766154516,,Dissertations & Theses," Sperber, JodiSperberJodiSperber, Jodi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3956694811 , 102231822 , 66569 , 9781339468464 , 10010835 , 10010835", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339468464, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1766154516?accountid=14496," 0344 Social research , 0630 Public policy , 0680 Health education , 0769 Health care management"," 0344 Social research , 0630 Public policy , 0680 Health education , 0769 Health care management"," 0344 Social research , 0630 Public policy , 0680 Health education , 0769 Health care management",," 0344 Social research , 0630 Public policy , 0680 Health education , 0769 Health care management"," Social research , Public policy , Health education , Health care management"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Education , Breast cancer , Ethnography , Online community , Patient centered care , Social media , Twitter",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Patient+Driven%2C+Patient+Centered+Care%3A+Examining+Engagement+within+a+Health+Community+Based+on+Twitter&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sperber%2C+Jodi&amp;isbn=9781339468464&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Friends, natives, and republicans: Three essays on John Locke and the natural law","In the broadest sense, the three essays that form this dissertation address certain normative features in John Locke’s philosophy. “ On Revolution: Arendt, Locke, and Republican Revisionism” deals with Hannah Arendt’s early republican revisionism that removes Locke’s influence from the American revolutionary period. Her (mistaken) belief is that Locke’s political philosophy encourages social disengagement and political apathy. In “One Body of People: Locke on Amerindians, Protestant Evangelism, and the Colonization of North America” I take seriously Locke’s religious devotion and reassess his colonial philosophy through an “evangelical” lens. It turns out his colonial thought was not motivated by “punishment” but by a perceived collective good. In “Friends in the State of Nature: John Locke and the Formation of Security Communities,” I explore the routinely overlooked fact that Locke characterizes humans as highly sociable and prone to friendship. To be sure, friendship and trust not only exist in the state of nature, they are what precipitate the contractual movement into civil society. This is particularly relevant given the fact that the realist tradition within International Relations almost reflexively characterizes the relationship between states as one of ruthless self ­interest. The way Locke speaks about the formation of political communities is highly reminiscent of “security communities,” a term popularized by Karl Deustch in the late 1950s, which describes groups of people who have integrated to such an extent that conflict can be managed in nonviolent ways. Locke characterizes the international community both in terms of moral communities (where different regions of the world share different values), and also in terms of economic communities of varying degrees of interdependence.",1767229973,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith, Brian ScottSmithScottBrianSmith, Brian Scott",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3960144841 , 102313702 , 66569 , 9781339494517 , 10016261 , 10016261", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339494517, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1767229973?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Arendt, Hannah , Colonization , Locke, John , Security communities",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Friends%2C+natives%2C+and+republicans%3A+Three+essays+on+John+Locke+and+the+natural+law&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+Brian+Scott&amp;isbn=9781339494517&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Modern Architecture and Capitalist Patronage in Ahmedabad, India 1947-1969","This dissertation examines the architectural patronage of a small cadre of industrialists, textile millowners, who controlled the city of Ahmedabad, India economically and politically between Indian independence in 1947 and 1968, the year communal riots shattered that city's self-image. It examines the role modern architecture played for these elites in projecting Ahmedabad as a modern, cosmopolitan city, though one steeped in a unique history and culture. On the one hand, modern architecture was used to promote the city as a node in the global network of capital and industry that developed after the Second World War. As such, most of the architects selected by these industrialists came from the ranks and institutions of the global modern movement, mirroring the industrialists' attempt to place the city's industry into global networks of capital and development. On the other hand, the millowners employed modern architecture as a way to naturalize Ahmedabad's sweeping social changes, so that they appeared as an inevitable outgrowth of Ahmedabad's and India's own history. In this, the modern architecture of Ahmedabad was suffused with references both to Ahmedabad's textile industry and India's imagined and historical past. The first chapter examines projects that represent the industrialists' earliest overtures towards the global network of modern architects and institutions. The goal of the projects, which included an unbuilt store by Frank Lloyd Wright, a store inspired by Buckminster Fuller's geodesic domes, and Achyut Kanvinde's Gropius influenced ATIRA headquarters, was to instantiate a capitalist model of modernity in Ahmedabad through the fostering of consumer markets and the rationalization of industry. The second chapter delves further into the millowners' use of modern architecture for the instantiation of capitalist values and self-representation by comparing the city's two most famous modern projects: Louis Kahn's Indian Institute of Management and Le Corbusier's Millowners' Association Building. The third and fourth chapters turn to the cultural and domestic sphere, exploring projects that negotiated modern, Indian identity in the public and private context. Cultural institutions by architects like Le Corbusier, Charles Correa, and Balkrishna Doshi interrogated the relationship between the elite's new vision for Ahmedabad and the city's history. Meanwhile houses by many of the same architects for industrialists showed a modern domesticity that negotiated between community, the joint family and the individual by fusing modern forms to older domestic spatial organizations. This dissertation contributes to the growing body of research focused on the role modern architecture played in shaping postcolonial Indian identity and subjectivity. While previous research has often focused on the patronage of the socialist state, the examination of the patronage of an elite group of capitalists shows how modern architecture became the locus for debates about the direction of modern Indian society. Further, the dissertation's focus on capitalist patronage places this dissertation in a larger body of research that traces the connections between capital and modern projects, though such issues have rarely been explored in the Indian context.",1769838831,,Dissertations & Theses," Williamson, DanielWilliamsonDanielWilliamson, Daniel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 3969073111 , 102533392 , 66569 , 9781339520926 , 10025620 , 10025620", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339520926, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1769838831?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture",," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture"," Art history , Architecture"," Communication and the arts , Ahmedabad , Architecture , Modern",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Modern+Architecture+and+Capitalist+Patronage+in+Ahmedabad%2C+India+1947-1969&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Williamson%2C+Daniel&amp;isbn=9781339520926&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The Implementation of Governance to Counter Islamist Militancy in Pakistan's Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Province,"Militancy inspired by Islamists is escalating globally, and government action is necessary to protect vulnerable populations. Security professionals generally agree that governance may complement the use of force to defeat militants; however, current doctrine does not address the concurrent integration of governance in a comprehensive strategy. This interpretive case study explored Pakistan’s application of governance during the 2009 Khyber operation in Swat Valley, code-named Operation Rah-e-Rast. The central research question focused on how governance activities were integrated with military operations to subdue militancy. Data were collected through interviews with 6 planners, Pakistani secondary source survey data, and government artifacts. Data were inductively coded using a progressive axial coding process and validated through methodological triangulation. Data were then analyzed using a case study analytical model, grounded in neo-Clausewitzian theoretical principles, to derive key themes. Key findings indicate that an interministry collaborative approach to regain the public trust was more effective in placating violence than was solely using military action. Sound governance, enabled by strategic communications and intelligence, fostered tribal relationships that promoted confidence and undermined the militant support base. The civil-military planning protocols were successful, but mainly ad-hoc and suboptimized. Formal training, standing civil-military planning forums, and planning process improvements stemming from the Pakistan experience could instill social change by assisting national leaders in developing a cogent countermilitancy strategy to defeat the global Islamist movement.",1776716271,,Dissertations & Theses," DiOrio, David R.DiOrioR.DavidDiOrio, David R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4003927501 , 103427742 , 66569 , 9781339575933 , 10061201 , 10061201", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339575933, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1776716271?accountid=14496," 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0750 Military studies"," 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0750 Military studies"," 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0750 Military studies",," 0630 Public policy , 0638 South Asian Studies , 0750 Military studies"," Public policy , South Asian Studies , Military studies"," Social sciences , Case study , Countermilitancy , Khyber-pakhtunkhwa , Neo-clausewitzian , Rah-e-rast , Swat",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Implementation+of+Governance+to+Counter+Islamist+Militancy+in+Pakistan%27s+Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa+Province&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=DiOrio%2C+David+R.&amp;isbn=9781339575933&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"After the 'post-sixties': A cultural history of Utopia in the United States,"After the ‘Post-Sixties’: A Cultural History of Utopia in the United States is an historical inquiry into the cultures of utopian thought and practice. Consisting of three multi-chapter sections, this cultural history unfolds as an account of utopian, anti-utopian, and dystopian imagination through different periodizations. Each section attempts to extend Fredric Jameson’s 1984 essay “Periodizing the 60s” to a history of the present period, developing a historical framework for understanding the politics of utopia. The last section of this dissertation deals with utopia and dystopia as cultural tendencies in the historical imagination of the 2007-2008 financial crisis and the global explosion of social movements and uprisings that extended from the Movement of Squares in the North Africa, the Middle East, and parts of the Mediterranean, to the Occupy Wall Street encampments in the United States. The first section builds toward this account of the contemporary period, through a series of analyses of literature, film, subcultures, music, architectures, and historical phenomena that engage with communalist, feminist, punk, anti-colonial, and anti-capitalist articulations of ‘utopia.’ The second section examines the recuperation of countercultural utopianism in post-1960s history of tech corporations and creative industries in the United States. In constructing a periodization of the end of the post-sixties, this cultural history considers various shifts and mutations in the political imaginary of neoliberalism, and takes up utopia as an epistemological problematic of contemporary global capitalism.

Working with AIDS support groups in northernmost Cabo Delgado Province, I problematize the utopian depiction of patient groups as a forum for infusing political subjectivity. Prone to internal conflict and hijacking by careerists, members compete for resources and inclusion in formal development projects. This antagonizes the relationship between civil society and the communities it presumes to serve, fostering distress and instability between and among groups. Poor treatment adherence and biomedical skepticism, alcoholism, and economic desperation pose serious obstacles to social solidarity and progress. In the name of “health systems strengthening” and the “decentralization” of clinical services, AIDS-specific treatment centers known as “day hospitals” were closed down nationwide. The discouraging state response to organized protests exposed the fragility of a rights-based approach to political oppression, suggesting that the broadly resonant “master frame” associated with AIDS activism—more treatment, for more people, in more places—has been successfully absorbed into wider governance structures. No longer victims in global health parlance, the patient voice has become diluted and devalued. Allowing itself to be defined by political process theory, I argue, AIDS activism has become unmade. A focus on its emergence, rather than the viability of its forms and strategies, has created an academic blindspot, contributing to activism’s obsolescence, and relocating it from streets and communities into multinational institutions and the offices of government contractors. Due to selection bias and a poor diversity of case studies, anthropology finds itself enamored with sweeping and invariant models of social movements. Ethnographic data presented here suggest that political involvement and demands for treatment alone are insufficient for sustainable patient mobilization, and that we may not be learning about biosociality from enough sources. Creating a safe haven for the common HIV/AIDS patient begs renewal of the concept of therapeutic community, and a reformulation of patient rights that is more practical than radical, and more local than transnational.",1786960595,,Dissertations & Theses," Reed, Joel ChristianReedChristianJoelReed, Joel Christian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4045669971 , 104497992 , 66569 , 9781339668857 , 10103302 , 10103302", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339668857, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1786960595?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health"," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health"," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health",," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0573 Public health"," African Studies , Cultural anthropology , Public health"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Activism , Biosociality , Civil society , HIV/aids , Health systems , Mozambique",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Unmaking+activism%3A+Political+and+practical+aids+patienthood+in+Northern+Mozambique&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reed%2C+Joel+Christian&amp;isbn=9781339668857&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Price of Cosmopolitanism: Globalization, Class Structure, and Language Endangerment in Shanghai","Over the last two decades, Shanghai has experienced an unprecedented transformation, as China’s economic globalization and urban expansion have increased rapidly. Looking beyond statistics and architectural spectacles, I examine a seemingly personal choice in Shanghai, speaking Putonghua Mandarin, the official language, or the Shanghai dialect. This study contextualizes the contested urban linguistic space, and illustrates the political, social, and cultural conditions in this China’s globalizing city. Through archival research, fifty in-depth interviews, two hundred and fifty survey questionnaires, and ethnographic fieldwork in Shanghai in the fall and winter of 2013, I document the impact of three sets of state policies driving the Shanghai dialect to the brink of extinction, and reactions of Shanghairen (Shanghai people) to preserve their linguistic heritage, and to safeguard their place-bound identity. First, state language policies systematically put Shanghai dialect at a discriminated position, through a nationalist agenda associating the official language with patriotism, and upward social mobility. In response to this state-sponsored language oppression, a grassroots dialect preservation movements struggles to protect Shanghai’s linguistic heritage. Second, urban redevelopment policies to accommodate the infrastructure demanded by a global city displaced more than one million Shanghai households out of the urban center. It not only deprives them of the urban central residency, challenges their claim to urban public space, but also disperses the Shanghai dialect community. Facing an urban built environment bearing little relevance to Shanghai’s history and long-time residents, Shanghairen rejects newly-built architectural spectacles and articulates an alternative image of cosmopolitan Shanghai located in the historical urban center. The third reason behind the rapid decline of Shanghai dialect speaking is the influx of millions of internal migrants, and the selective social integration of these non-speakers in Shanghai after reforms of the household registration ( hukou ) system. Instead of a dual society characterized by those with a Shanghai urban hukou and those without, my study suggests a more nuanced social class restructuring. On the one hand, migrants now have better overall chances for social acceptance and integration as institutional barriers represented by an individual’s hukou status have receded; on the other hand, social and cultural boundaries are effectively maintained through language and lifestyle. Only those highly educated and wealthy newcomers are accepted on the job market and in social circles, while less-educated rural migrants are excluded. To synthesize, in exchange for Shanghai’s global city status and improved standard of living, Shanghairen have been relocated away from the urban center, while their linguistic right to the city is threatened. They have also experienced relative deprivation of privileges in terms of exclusive access to employment and top quality social services.

A study comparing urban and rural area,"China has seen rapid and dramatic economic growth over the past three decades that has brought about significant changes in culture, the structure of employment and sizable migration from rural to urban areas. As a result of these shifts, the composition of the labor market has changed, including the labor force participation rate. Numerous explanations have been offered for these trends. One argument is that the movement away from the SOE to a private system of employment created disincentives as well as obstacles for women’s employment that linger to some extent. The goal of this study is to examine the effects of a variety of micro- and macro-level factors on the probability that a woman will be employed. Wide economic disparities, and broad differences in household structure and demographic composition exist between urban and rural areas in China. Thus it is reasonable to assume that the factors that shape women’s employment decisions would differ across the two populations.

In the quest for a just and lasting resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, most scholarly attention has been focused on the state (and people) of Israel and the people of Palestine. As a result, we have focused too little attention on the role of support for U.S. nationalism in the American Jewish community in sustaining the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. I argue that a critical juncture in this process occurred in the early twentieth century, as the United States emerged as an international power. Many of the early leaders of Americanized Zionism, such as Horace M. Kallen and Justice Louis Brandeis, began their careers as Progressive reformers and brought their ideas about social and political action with them into the Zionist movement. Brandeis in particular played a critical role in making Zionism acceptable to American Jews. As this Americanized version of Zionism has become normalized in American Jewish life, the principle of Jewish sovereignty has become widely understood among American Jews to be an essential guarantor of Jewish safety. To understand the roots and implications of this stance, I explore the genealogy of the idea of sovereignty, as well as the binary opposition of “Arabs” and “Jews” in Euro-American thought. Americanized Zionism, I conclude, is less a product of Jewish ethnicity or religion than enactment of a commitment to U.S. nationalism as a fundamental aspect of American Jewish identity.",1794167069,,Dissertations & Theses," Kamel, RachaelKamelRachaelKamel, Rachael",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4079399391 , 105208512 , 66569 , 9781339745411 , 10111332 , 10111332", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339745411, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1794167069?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0751 Judaic studies",," 0318 Religion , 0323 American studies , 0563 Peace Studies , 0751 Judaic studies"," Religion , American studies , Peace Studies , Judaic studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , American studies , Cultural studies , Jewish studies , Nationalism , Progressivism , Zionism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Thinking+Beyond+Identity%2C+Nationalism%2C+and+Empire&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kamel%2C+Rachael&amp;isbn=9781339745411&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The impact of internal characteristics on global health epistemic community effectiveness: The cases of global surgery, early childhood development, and urban health","In an increasingly globalized world, non-state transnational actors and networks are becoming more numerous and influential. These include epistemic communities—professional networks with recognized competence and policy-relevant expertise in particular issues. Studies examining epistemic community effectiveness have emphasized factors associated with the characteristics of the issues being addressed and the political environment (external factors) to the neglect of the strategies adopted and choices made by epistemic community members (internal factors). This neglect has limited understanding of epistemic communities and hampered theoretical development of the epistemic community concept. Through replicated case studies of three global health epistemic communities—addressing surgery, early childhood development, and urban health—I investigated why some epistemic communities are better able than others to place their issues on global agendas. My aim was to better explain: 1) how epistemic communities emerge and develop; 2) how an epistemic community’s internal qualities interact with external characteristics in shaping its influence; and 3) what factor or set of factors has the greatest explanatory power in explaining epistemic community influence. I triangulated among several data sources, including semi-structured interviews with involved individuals, as well as peer-reviewed research, organization reports, conference notes, and grey literature, in order to piece together the modern history of global attention to each of the global health issues. I conducted 76 interviews and reviewed 746 documents, utilizing a process-tracing methodology. I drew on ideas from existing epistemic community scholarship, constructivist scholarship in the areas of global governance, networks, policy, and social movements, as well as my data from the three empirical cases to create a conceptual framework, organized by internal and external factors, for analyzing epistemic community development and effectiveness. In all three cases examined, the external factors alone—the social, economic, and historic forces or structures that are not explicitly inherent to epistemic communities—offered an incomplete explanation for the historical neglect of the issues on global agendas. Despite the fact that the three global health cases shared some common external features that explain each of these issue’s historical neglect (i.e., multi-sectorality, lack of sufficient data to demonstrate solution tractability, etc.), there were differences in their trajectories of attention. Much of this was due to internal features. Specifically, the way in which each of these communities organized to pursue their collective goals (governance), their extent of agreement around the problem and how to address it (member cohesion), and how the case for the issue was made to policy and decision-makers (external positioning) were critical for understanding the variance in epistemic community effectiveness over time and across the cases. Ultimately, however, the amount of global attention that an issue received could only be explained by the interaction between these three internal factors and external factors. In all three cases, the internal and external qualities were intertwined: the epistemic communities transformed the very nature of the issue they sought to advance, which then created a new political environment, which then transformed how the epistemic communities behaved and their very nature. The characteristics of the issue and the policy environment are not determinative of epistemic community formation or effectiveness. While important, consideration of an epistemic community’s agency is critical to understanding how it forms and its ultimate ability to advance its issue on global agendas. The findings point to three unique implications, which challenge and advance epistemic community theory. First, an epistemic community’s member cohesion is not given, as suggested by the existing epistemic community scholarship; rather, it is a key determinant of effectiveness. Second, leadership at the individual and institutional levels—a factor not considered by existing epistemic community scholarship—is crucial to explaining variance in epistemic community effectiveness. Finally, there are multiple pathways—ones that extend beyond the presence of a shock or crisis as suggested by existing epistemic community scholarship—that lead decision-makers to turn to epistemic communities and ultimately make them powerful forces in global politics.",1794656429,,Dissertations & Theses," Shawar, Yusra RibhiShawarRibhiYusraShawar, Yusra Ribhi0000-0002-9539-0341",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4080277201 , 105229842 , 66569 , 9781339762548 , 10113134 , 10113134", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339762548, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1794656429?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy",," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0630 Public policy"," International Relations , Political science , Public policy"," Social sciences , Agenda setting , Epistemic community , Global governance , Global health policy , Transnational network",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+impact+of+internal+characteristics+on+global+health+epistemic+community+effectiveness%3A+The+cases+of+global+surgery%2C+early+childhood+development%2C+and+urban+health&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Shawar%2C+Yusra+Ribhi&amp;isbn=9781339762548&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Don't just sit there, do something: A theological interpretation of the Buddha as political activist and peacemaker","Many U.S. Buddhist practices have become so focused on the individual that they over-emphasize self-salvation and healing. To a large degree, this has occurred to the detriment of U.S. Buddhists becoming engaged in political action and peacemaking. While individual salvation is an important aspect of U.S. Buddhism, in reexamining the Buddha’s life theologically I have come to the inescapable conclusion that it need not be the only aspect. The Buddha was an intentional peacemaker and was purposefully politically engaged in his north Indian society. I have found motivations in his life that suggest the Buddha understood the relationship between social and individual suffering and the role of peace in allaying both. By deliberately teaching and converting, and thus transforming the wealthy and powerful elite of his day, the Buddha purposely changed the power dynamics of his world so that they shifted, becoming aligned with peace, reconciliation, and compassion. It is therefore my declaration that if we today follow this example of the Buddha and become engaged as the Buddha did, we will offer something quite revolutionary to the current fields of peacemaking and political engagement. Consequently, U.S. Buddhists wishing to engage the world in these ways need only follow in the footsteps of the Buddha to do so; and, when joining with existent social change, justice, and peacekeeping movements, we U.S. Buddhists can expand U.S. Buddhism’s role beyond its currently individually-focused practices. The Buddha’s teachings, when engaged and applied to the world deliberately and peacefully, can assist current political movements in bringing about further social change and a more stabilized global peace.",1798009200,,Dissertations & Theses," Skye, Akasa ZhonnuSkyeZhonnuAkasaSkye, Akasa Zhonnu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4094531371 , 105944572 , 66569 , 9781339745039 , 10111294 , 10111294", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339745039, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1798009200?accountid=14496," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0344 Social research , 0469 Theology"," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0344 Social research , 0469 Theology"," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0344 Social research , 0469 Theology",," 0322 Religion , 0322 Philosophy , 0344 Social research , 0469 Theology"," Religion , Philosophy , Social research , Theology"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Activism , Buddhism , Interreligious , Peace , Social justice , United States",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Don%27t+just+sit+there%2C+do+something%3A+A+theological+interpretation+of+the+Buddha+as+political+activist+and+peacemaker&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Skye%2C+Akasa+Zhonnu&amp;isbn=9781339745039&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Homosexuals after the Holocaust: Sexual citizenship and the politics of memory in Germany and the United States, 1945 - 2008","“Homosexuals after the Holocaust” explores how various actors in the Federal Republic of Germany and the United States of America transformed collective memories of the Nazis’ persecution of homosexuals into transnational discourses that shaped modern conceptions of human rights and civil liberties. I argue that judges, homosexual concentration camp survivors, gay rights activists, professional historians, playwrights, journalists, and state officials on both sides of the Atlantic used the past to mediate the meaning of sexuality, justice, citizenship, and civil rights in the present. At the heart of this dissertation, therefore, is a study of the relationship between the politics of memory and sexual citizenship. Chapter One provides an overview of the experiences of homosexual men and women in the Third Reich, which later became the foundation for postwar collective memories. This chapter situates the Nazis’ campaign against homosexuality in the context of a broader redefinition of citizenship along racial lines. The second chapter demonstrates that the politics of memory in the Adenauer era resulted in the rejection of homosexuals from the official definition of “victimhood,” which excluded homosexual survivors from the process of Wiedergutmachung and relegated homosexuals to second-class citizens in West Germany. Chapter Three shows that the public discourses surrounding the terrorization of homosexuals in the Third Reich, though originating in Germany, ultimately transcended national boundaries. Collective memories of the Nazi past provided historical roots for a transatlantic gay identity and empowered a transnational social movement for the rights of gay and lesbian citizens on both sides of the Atlantic. The final chapter argues that, beginning in the 1980s, a rapid proliferation of public discourses transformed the Nazi persecution of homosexuals into a moral, political, and scholarly topic about human rights in a diverse, democratic society.",1798468695,,Dissertations & Theses," Newsome, W.

Indeed, since its passage, the CLA has been upheld as a piece of “landmark legislation”—a precedent and even a model for subsequent redress and reparations movements; these are movements not only within the U.S. but around the world. Still, I find that the so-called “success” of Japanese American redress remains haunted—haunted by the memories of the 2,264 Japanese Latin Americans (JLAs) who were, in effect, kidnapped upon U.S. order by the governments of thirteen Latin American countries and brought to U.S. concentration camps whereby hundreds were then used in a U.S. hostage exchange program with Japan. Despite their efforts, these internees were denied recognition under the CLA and only after filing a class-action lawsuit against the U.S. government in 1998 were offered a sum of just $5,000. This dissertation maps the varied discourses marking the subsequent attempts at governmental redress for the JLA deportation and internment program over the last thirty some years. Probing the question of historical justice for racialized state violence within the overlapping contexts of U.S. empire and international human rights regimes, it asks: What are the transformative possibilities and limits of “redress” as the late-modern paradigmatic logic for racial/social justice, including its underlying liberal humanist ethicality of violence, redemption and justice? What does this case in particular open up in terms of the politics of knowledge and historical justice concerning U.S. global reach and hegemony in the Americas and U.S. empire more broadly at the current global historical moment? Ultimately, this project, deploying a rigorously interdisciplinary approach, both illuminates the very paradigmatic violence of redress as late-modern juridical justice, including its formative role as a fundamental condition of U.S. empire since the end of the cold war, and, at the same time, reveals the very paradigmatic productivity of such violence—its opening up of alternative imaginings and praxis of justice located not within the law itself but precisely in its critique and deconstruction.",1799629182,,Dissertations & Theses," Kozen, Cathleen KiyomiKozenKiyomiCathleenKozen, Cathleen Kiyomi",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4101539661 , 106093802 , 66569 , 9781339864839 , 10128471 , 10128471", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339864839, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1799629182?accountid=14496," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0343 Asian American Studies , 0398 Law , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Asian American Studies , Law , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Historical justice , Internment camps , Japanese Americans , Japanese Latin americans , Redress , Reparations",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Justice+and+Its+Others%3A+On+the+Politics+of+Redress+for+Japanese+Latin+Americans&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kozen%2C+Cathleen+Kiyomi&amp;isbn=9781339864839&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Care and the construction of hacker identities, communities, and society","Recent scholarship in Human-Computer Interaction, science and technology studies, and design research has focused on hacker communities as sites of innovation and entrepreneurship, novel forms of education, and the democratization of technological production. However, hacking practices are more than new technical practices; they are also political, value-laden, and ideological practices. The significances of these underlying commitments is less understood not only in academic research, but also within the communities themselves, which tend to profess a libertarian ethos often articulated as apolitical. In this dissertation, I investigate how the process of developing a hacker identity within a hacker community is influenced not only by technical skill, but also by care and community maintenance practices. By studying their projects, community interactions, and social policies, I explore how the broader hackerspace movement unintentionally but systematically excludes broader participation. I leverage several qualitative methods to create a well-rounded account of the hacker identity development process, including: an interview study of hackers’ projects; a 19-month ethnography in a hackerspace; and an analysis of the most-discussed issues on the international hackerspaces.org Discuss listserv. I analyzed these data through a lens informed by care ethics, foregrounding the interdependent, nurturing relationships hackers develop, and explicating the duties to care that are felt and acted on—but rarely discussed—in these spaces. I present results suggesting that developing a hacker identity can be a vulnerable process, and is both supported and made difficult by the social environment in these communities. While critical to a hackerspace’s success, care and maintenance practices are often overshadowed by rhetoric of self-empowerment and independence. As a result, it becomes difficult for women and minorities to join and fit in, despite members’ best intentions. These results have implications for research on hackerspaces, for hackerspaces themselves, and for analyses of care in such communities.",1800547682,,Dissertations & Theses," Toombs, Austin LewisToombsLewisAustinToombs, Austin Lewis",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4104765841 , 104755622 , 66569 , 9781339756035 , 10112449 , 10112449", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339756035, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1800547682?accountid=14496," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science"," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science",," 0700 Social structure , 0703 Organizational behavior , 0723 Information science , 0984 Computer science"," Social structure , Organizational behavior , Information science , Computer science"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Applied sciences , Care ethics , Critical ethnography , Feminist theory , Hackerspace , Human-computer interaction , Maker culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Care+and+the+construction+of+hacker+identities%2C+communities%2C+and+society&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Toombs%2C+Austin+Lewis&amp;isbn=9781339756035&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"An analysis of the relationship between standardized testing and self-regulated learning,"Today's educational mission statements at national, state, and local levels revolve around much the same thing—preparing students with skills to compete and succeed on a global level. The Partnership for 21st Century Skills (2008) reports cognitive skills are significantly more important for the global economic success of a country, and in order for the United States to stay the dominating economic powerhouse in the world, we have to make sure our students are learning. The state of Texas has followed suit by setting the Texas Education Agency's (TEA) mission of educating the state's students for success in a global economy (TEA, 2015). The educational reform movement of the past two decades has centered primarily on improving teacher quality, and teaching strategies used in the classroom. This model is built on standardization of curriculum and tests, and extrinsic motivation using the measure of test scores as the output for all stakeholders in the educational setting. This study sought to analyze student achievement from a different context. The perspective of what the student does to learn, and also used standardized tests as the output for the measurement of achievement. The field of educational psychology has research in student learning both from the social cognitive and personality theoretical frameworks with similar results. This study looked at the intrinsic motivations and behaviors influencing learners and its effect on academic achievement know as self-regulated learning (Pintrich, 2004; Zimmerman, 1990). This study used the Texas Education Agency as the source for identifying the average STAAR scale scores and accountability ratings of 166 Texas public high schools. Self-regulated learning behavior was attained through student self-report from 166 college freshmen from private, public, and community college institutions within the state of Texas. Canonical correlational analysis and multivariate analysis of variance were used to assess statistical significance between these two variables. Results for both analyses suggest there is no statistical significance in the relationship between variables of standardized testing and self-regulated learning.",1804048268,,Dissertations & Theses," Elliott, Mary R.ElliottR.MaryElliott, Mary R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4117580501 , 106453462 , 66569 , 9781339797540 , 10118423 , 10118423", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339797540, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1804048268?accountid=14496," 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0525 Educational psychology"," 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0525 Educational psychology"," 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0525 Educational psychology",," 0288 Educational tests & measurements , 0525 Educational psychology"," Educational tests & measurements , Educational psychology"," Education , Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire , Self-regulated learning , Self-regulation , Social cognitive theory , Standardized testing , State of Texas Assessment of Academic Readiness",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=An+analysis+of+the+relationship+between+standardized+testing+and+self-regulated+learning&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Elliott%2C+Mary+R.&amp;isbn=9781339797540&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Everyday Montreal, 1972: Museum and Film Dialogues on Urban Redevelopment","As popularization movements that emerged in the 1960s reshaped museum exhibition practices and public attitudes toward urban redevelopment, these shifts intersected in the urbanism exhibitions of that era. At the 1972 Montreal Museum of Fine Arts exhibition Montreal, plus or minus? , participants such as documentary photographers, feminist performance groups, and community activists involved in preserving the cultural landscapes of local neighborhoods presented participatory exhibits and grassroots narratives on housing, environment, and historic preservation. This dissertation argues that as the exhibition advocated for grassroots solidarity against redevelopment through the sociocultural concept of an everyday Montreal, it exposed and challenged the naturalization of power in the Museum and city spaces. Through an interdisciplinary analysis of exhibition installations, guided tours, docùmentary media, museum records, media reviews, and interviews with several participants, this study traces the representation, circulation, and reception of anti-redevelopment discourse in Montreal. While the Museum looked to public media as a model for public participation and engagement, its administrators recognized popular culture with hesitation and deemphasized politically charged narratives. Many exhibits asserted the urban, working-class, francophone identity characteristic of contemporary visual culture and film. This investigation, however, turns to critiques of the myths of identity inscribed in the urban fabric to address the spatial and material exclusion of groups marginalized by the modern city. As films and representations of the city mediated its spatial politics, delineating physical and cultural boundaries and barriers, patron objections to the intrusion of urban culture and class conflict into the exhibition and the Museum's environment underscored these social divides. The exhibition's display of urban material culture challenged the connoisseurship and the cultural capital of Museum patrons, bridging institutional critique and grassroots political solidarity through the concept of everyday life as culture. The 1972 exhibition demonstrates the emerging democratization of the discourse on urban renewal and the transnational circulation of these ideas between Canada, the US, and Europe. Consequently, this study develops a view of museums and public media as loci for popular debates on the modern city, suggesting that such productions are a process for cultivating discourse on the place of urbanism in the cultural landscape.",1807646801,,Dissertations & Theses," Chan, YennaChanYennaChan, Yenna",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4132268481 , 106764362 , 66569 , 9781339957975 , 10140399 , 10140399", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339957975, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1807646801?accountid=14496," 0729 Architecture , 0730 Museum studies , 0999 Urban planning"," 0729 Architecture , 0730 Museum studies , 0999 Urban planning"," 0729 Architecture , 0730 Museum studies , 0999 Urban planning",," 0729 Architecture , 0730 Museum studies , 0999 Urban planning"," Architecture , Museum studies , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Civic Engagement , Community Culture , Documentary Film , Exhibitions , Spatial Politics , Urban Renewal",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Everyday+Montreal%2C+1972%3A+Museum+and+Film+Dialogues+on+Urban+Redevelopment&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Chan%2C+Yenna&amp;isbn=9781339957975&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Sagebrush Laborers: Basque Immigrants in Nevada's Sheep Industry, International Dimensions, and the Making of an Agricultural Workforce, 1880-1954","This study explores the history of Basque immigration to the rangelands of Nevada. It views the Basque immigrant sheepherder labor within the social, economic, political, and cultural context of Nevada. Tensions and conflicts occurred as immigrant workers confronted new environments, new labor conditions, and new social adjustments in the context of their new immigrant status. As such, issues developed with other ethnic workforces and over land and water use, particularly upon the advent of the Progressive Conservation Movement in the Far West. In the late nineteenth century, as sheep and cattle grazing expanded into Nevada (especially from California and Texas), Basque immigrant labor became increasingly visible and encountered discrimination in the use of public ranges. Yet, as the twentieth century progressed stock operators (Basque and Anglo alike) in the sheep industry began to prize Basque labor in the grazing of sheep to the point where that labor became privileged above all others. A stereotype developed of Basque sheepherders that reaffirmed an image of their natural expertise for the tending of sheep that could not be duplicated by any other racial or ethnic group. This study attempts to deconstruct the essentialism surrounding the making of these views that not only attribute to Basques special sheepherding skills, but also confer upon them a degree of racial whiteness and values that entitled them to a privileged labor category. The 1924 restrictive Immigration Act resulted in a truncated labor supply from the Basque Country. During the Great Depression and especially in WWII the labor shortage became acute. In response Senator Patrick McCarran from Nevada lobbied on behalf of his woolgrowing constituency to open the immigration doors for Basques. Subsequently Cold War international tensions offered opportunities for a rapprochement between the United States and Francisco Franco despite Spain’s previous sympathy with the Axis powers. McCarran took it upon himself to become an informal intermediary with the Spanish dictator to seek more flexible policies on immigration to permit Basques to enter the United States. Ultimately this study explores the role of Basque agricultural labor and McCarran’s ad-hoc diplomacy as catalysts that eventually helped bring Spain into the orbit of western democracies.",1808215608,,Dissertations & Theses," Saitua Idarraga, IkerSaitua IdarragaIkerSaitua Idarraga, Iker",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4135042281 , 106832582 , 66569 , 9781339840840 , 10126026 , 10126026", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339840840, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1808215608?accountid=14496," 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0337 American history , 0601 International Relations , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American history , International Relations , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Agricultural labor , Basque , Immigration , McCarran, Patrick , Nevada , Sheep industry",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Sagebrush+Laborers%3A+Basque+Immigrants+in+Nevada%27s+Sheep+Industry%2C+International+Dimensions%2C+and+the+Making+of+an+Agricultural+Workforce%2C+1880-1954&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Saitua+Idarraga%2C+Iker&amp;isbn=9781339840840&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Metafiction In Mourning: The Intersections of Gender Performance and Postdictatorial Memory in Novels by Luisa Valenzuela, Clarice Lispector, and Diamela Eltit","The purpose of this project is to build on two major theoretical fields, feminism and postdictatorial memory, in the context of Latin American women’s writing. The development of Latin American feminism has run concurrently with the broader feminist movements of the 20 th century, but has been shaped by the particularities and diversity of the region. Specific concerns relating to postcoloniality, religion, and nation have caused theorists like Debra A. Castillo to discuss Latin American feminism on its own, focusing on the inherent privileging of praxis over theory and the necessary pastiche of local and international theories. The development of Latin American feminism must also be considered within the context of the authoritarian governments that ruled during the mid-20 th century. The 1970s and 80s saw the rise of military dictatorships in Argentina, Brazil, and Chile. The widespread use of censorship and state-sponsored terrorism through detention and disappearances created an atmosphere of anxiety and trauma from which the national communities have yet to entirely heal. Idelber Avelar’s theoretical considerations of postdictatorial memory and the narrative of transition to democracy highlight the effects of social and personal trauma as depicted in literature. He develops his theory on mourning literature to describe a set of texts that neither engage in the official discourse of the dictatorship nor produce a counter-narrative that only exists relationally. Instead, Avelar’s mourning literature rips apart the binary and recognizes the multiplicity of truths that the social trauma of dictatorship constructs. Novels by Luisa Valenzuela of Argentina, Clarice Lispector of Brazil, and Diamela Eltit of Chile take part in this project of mourning with an added caveat that recognizes the heteronormativity inherent in the discourses not only of the dictatorships, but also of their broader societies. Drawing from Judith Butler’s concepts of grievability and gender performativity, this study analyzes novels by Latin American women writers that identify the heteronormative strictures of their milieux and blur the boundaries of sex and gender. Through a range of metafictional strategies, the writers studied here make clear to their readers that productive mourning of dictatorship cannot exist without a deeper critique and deconstruction of the heteronormative discourse on which both the dictatorships and the opposition are based.",1809106301,,Dissertations & Theses," Slobodian, Jennifer L.SlobodianL.JenniferSlobodian, Jennifer L.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4138966771 , 106885862 , 66569 , 9781339849676 , 10126929 , 10126929", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339849676, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1809106301?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0453 Womens studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0453 Womens studies"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0453 Womens studies",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0312 Latin American literature , 0453 Womens studies"," Comparative literature , Latin American literature , Womens studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Argentina , Brazil , Chile , Eltit, Diamela , Gender , Latin American , Lispector, Clarice , Metafiction , Mourning , Postdictatorship , Valenzuela, Luisa , Women writers",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Metafiction+In+Mourning%3A+The+Intersections+of+Gender+Performance+and+Postdictatorial+Memory+in+Novels+by+Luisa+Valenzuela%2C+Clarice+Lispector%2C+and+Diamela+Eltit&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Slobodian%2C+Jennifer+L.&amp;isbn=9781339849676&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Recalibrating youth bulge theory: saudi arabia's youth and the threat to security,"This thesis addresses the question of whether Saudi Arabia’s youth bulge presents a threat to domestic and international security. Youth bulge theory informs us that if countries are home to large youth populations whilst experiencing high levels of unemployment they are susceptible to civil unrest, terrorism or civil war. It is irrefutable that Saudi Arabia has a youth bulge, high unemployment and -- in spite of its perceived prosperity -- it has experienced both domestic and global terrorism, with 15 of the hijackers on September 11, 2001 coming from the Kingdom. Consequently, following 9/11 Saudi Arabia was criticized by the West for having a religious education system that turned out terrorists, an allegation it strongly refuted. Given the recent resurgence in domestic and international terrorism by young Saudi members of DAESH (Islamic State), both within Saudi Arabia and the Levant, after a decade of relative calm, there would appear to be a strong case to support the theory. However, in Arabia, things are not always as they may seem. It is argued that youth bulge theory is overly focused on civil war and needs to be recalibrated to take account of Saudi exceptionalism. Built upon a foundation of Social Movement Theory, this thesis is supported by the three pillars of youth bulge, terrorism and feminist theory; the latter because half the population has to date been ignored by the academy in the discussion on youth bulge. Drawing from Durkheim’s work on religion, education and suicide, and Habermas for his public sphere, administrative power, education and crisis in society, the theory is reinforced by exhaustive ethnographic research and data drawn from primary and secondary sources. This process to recalibrate youth bulge theory will lead us to a better understanding of Saudi youth and an explanation for why when a few young Saudis embraced terrorism, the vast majority did not.",1810881884,,Dissertations & Theses," Sayce, Terence RichardSayceRichardTerenceSayce, Terence Richard",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4145042271 , 105094772 , 101309 , 10136477 , 10136477 , http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/11483/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1810881884?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.dur.ac.uk/11483/ , (UMI)AAI10136477 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Recalibrating+youth+bulge+theory%3A+saudi+arabia%27s+youth+and+the+threat+to+security&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Sayce%2C+Terence+Richard&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Alternative politicking: Terrorism is a mechanism for political mobilization,"Terrorism is defined as the use, or threat, of violence in order to achieve political, religious, or ideological goals. It is also a mechanism for political mobilization. This later function as a method of alternative politicking is understudied. The strategic use of terrorism helps extremist groups compensate for their lack of traditional sources of power to participate in politics. Appealing to the individual and collective grievances and desires for vengeances of victims of government violence is the key mechanism linking terrorism to political mobilization. Shifts in opportunities for extremist groups to maximize the political mobilization payoffs from a terror attack explain variations in target selection and casualty rates. The current terrorism literature neglects social movement and civil conflict theories, the insights of which are grounded in political behavioral incentives and goals. This is problematic because it moves analysts away from the use of terror as a tactic of alternative politicking. While the causes and consequences of social movements are widely studied, the strategic choices extremist groups implement have been underexplored. By placing terrorism in the context of alternative politicking, we gain greater insight into the behavioral incentives that motivate the strategic decisions underpinning the use of radical political violence. If we accept extremist groups within this theoretical framework, we may better understand how extremist groups exploit government violence to supplement their membership and muster zealots. Introduced here, and supported with empirical analyses, is a theory of extremists’ alternative politicking through domestic terror attacks as a strategy of retribution and transnational terror as a strategy of provocation, both of which seek to accomplish the organizational necessities of radicalization, recruitment and political mobilization. Considering the behavioral incentives that motivate variation in both transnational and domestic terrorism improves policymakers’ ability to develop effective counterterrorism strategies. Paramount to improving our understanding of extremists’ alternative politicking and developing effective counterterrorism is considering how power and resource asymmetries dictate the strategic use of terrorism. Counterterrorism policy and operations would benefit from assessing the scenarios in which alternative politicking terror attacks are most prevalent, or most likely to occur.",1811442693,,Dissertations & Theses," Klein, Graig R.KleinR.GraigKlein, Graig R.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4147598561 , 106334832 , 66569 , 9781339927268 , 10134231 , 10134231", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339927268, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1811442693?accountid=14496, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science, 0615 Political science,, 0615 Political science, Political science," Social sciences , Casualties , Conflict , Extremists , Provocation , Retribution , Terrorism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Alternative+politicking%3A+Terrorism+is+a+mechanism+for+political+mobilization&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Klein%2C+Graig+R.&amp;isbn=9781339927268&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The great obligation: The Serampore missionaries and the rise of social service in Protestant missions,"At the close of the eighteenth century, Baptist missionaries William Carey, Joshua and Hannah Marshman, and William Ward traveled to India to start a mission. At the time, missionary work was seen by most Protestant Christians in Britain as a mandate strictly to preach the gospel to the unconverted. Almost from the moment of their landing at Serampore, however, these four missionaries redefined that mandate as something more comprehensive and humanitarian. They believed that missionaries were obligated not only to provide for the spiritual needs of their potential converts but also to care for their mental and physical welfare. With this in mind, the Serampore missionaries embarked on quest for social reforms and social services throughout India. In order to accomplish these goals, they lobbied the government to allow missionaries access to the prohibited parts of India. They also established numerous schools and colleges aimed to help the poor and marginalized groups. Finally, they rallied public and political support to bring about social reforms like the abolition of sati. In doing so, they transformed the nature of Protestant mission work. Inspired by their example, other denominations began to adopt the same methods all over the world.

Among these, explorations of “return” migration (i.e., a migration movement to one’s ethnic homeland) are of particular importance due to its potential effects on self-concept and mental wellbeing. Though a literature is emerging, the effects of return migration are understudied and populations of “return-return” migrants (persons who migrated to their ancestral homeland and subsequently returned to their country of origin) are virtually unexplored. This dissertation begins to fill a gap in our knowledge of return-return migration by examining Japanese Brazilian returnees’ migratory experiences and how they are associated with identity and mental wellbeing. More specifically, this dissertation explores how Japanese Brazilian return-return migrants negotiate their ethnic identities in different social contexts and stages of migration. It also examines how sociocultural and environmental factors and identity formation processes affect their mental wellbeing. To understand these issues, I conducted in-depth interviews with 38 Japanese Brazilian return-return migrants in the metropolitan region of São Paulo—home to the largest concentration of Japanese descendants outside of Japan. Findings suggest that most participants held a Japanese ethnic identity pre-migration. This identity was motivated and supported by familial socialization, involvement in ethnic activities, and ascribed positive minority status. In Japan, most participants failed to find their expected homeland and experienced disappointment, prejudice, and pressure to assimilate. In response, most developed a Brazilian counter-identity, which allowed for greater psychological distance between themselves and the native Japanese. Upon return to Brazil, findings suggest that a new hybrid identity (coined the Descendente identity) emerged in response to sociocultural push and pull factors, and as the result of an accumulation of synergistic migration and identity factors. Japanese Brazilian return-return migrants encountered many common migration stressors (e.g., loneliness and isolation, linguistic challenges) in Japan; however, they also experienced stressors that are directly related to their social identity as descendants and Brazilian nationals (e.g., prejudice associated with their families’ migration history, Brazil’s “Third World” status, and perceived cultural inadequacy). Depression, sadness, and loneliness were among the main expressions of emotional distress cited. Post-return migration, some participants experienced elevated levels of self-esteem associated with their return to positive minority status in Brazil; however, most were adversely affected by processes of social comparison and appraisal and perceptions of the environment (e.g., lack of safety and organization). Findings suggest that these may be the product of an interaction between migration and identity factors and internalized anti-Brazilian prejudice. Participants expressed emotional distress (i.e., fear, low self-esteem) in response to the unique resettlement challenges they experienced. By addressing the identity negotiation processes and mental wellbeing of Japanese Brazilian return-return migrants, this dissertation begins to pave the way toward a greater understanding of the final third of their migration journey. In doing so, it makes significant contributions to the immigration, identity, race and ethnicity, and mental health literatures, and contributes to a general understanding of return and return-return migrant populations beyond Japanese Brazilians.",1812333758,,Dissertations & Theses," Michida, TainahMichidaTainahMichida, Tainah",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4151271471 , 100855042 , 66569 , 9781369044188 , 10149300 , 10149300", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369044188, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1812333758?accountid=14496," 0347 Mental health , 0451 Social psychology , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0347 Mental health , 0451 Social psychology , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0347 Mental health , 0451 Social psychology , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0347 Mental health , 0451 Social psychology , 0626 Sociology , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Mental health , Social psychology , Sociology , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Psychology , Health and environmental sciences , Ethnic identity , Ethnicity , Japanese Brazilians , Mental health , Migration , Return migration",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Japanese+souls+and+Brazilian+hearts%3A+An+exploration+of+the+ethnic+identities+and+mental+wellbeing+of+Japanese+Brazilian+return-return+migrants&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Michida%2C+Tainah&amp;isbn=9781369044188&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Fiction and economics in post-colonial Senegal,"This dissertation examines uses of fictional narratives and cultural practices as tools for analyzing economic phenomena. Looking at form and aesthetics in different mediums of storytelling (novel and comics,) I investigate the tensions between fictional narratives and ethnographic accounts about the economy in the francophone African context. I focus on post-colonial Senegal since independence in 1960 to 2012. After years of ""African Socialism,"" a doctrine theorized by its first president Léopold Sédar Senghor and other leaders of African independence movements, Senegal was one of the first countries in Africa to go through the Structural Adjustment Programs (SAPs) brought upon by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. The social costs of these programs were palpable in the social fabric of Senegalese society. They gave birth to works of fiction and art that imparted the severity of the hardship. On the ground, everyday Senegalese had to devise novel practices to cope with their new economic environment. My dissertation analyzes these works and practices as a means to understand the local impact of global economic trends. My first chapter looks at Aminata Sow Fall's The Beggars' Strike , I argue that her landmark novel provides a critique of modernity in a post-colonial context. Examining the relationship between almsgivers and beggars, I provide an allegorical reading of sacrificial alms in the postcolony by looking at foreign aid as a global practice in which one can untangle power struggles between givers and receivers, and more precisely donors and recipients. My second chapter follows the main protagonist of a comic series that emerged in the late 1980s: Goorgoorlou. Goorgoorlou is a head of household who lost his job because of the structural adjustment programs and now has to look for odd jobs to feed his family. I argue that the emergence of archetypes of the informal economy—such as Goorgoorlou can allow us to break the boundaries of neoclassical economic tradition that has hitherto functioned as a unitary thought and model. I therefore compare Goorgoorlou with Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, the quintessential economic man, often labeled homo oeconomicus by neoclassical economists. Lastly, my final chapter explores youth migration to Europe by examining the topos of the Atlantic Ocean in Fatou Diome's The Belly of the Atlantic . Connecting migration to slavery through the history of the Atlantic, I inscribe Diome's work in a history of global capitalism in which people's individual stories intersect with a history of commodities, trade and labor based on forced or voluntary migration.",1813326489,,Dissertations & Theses," Seck, FatoumataSeckFatoumataSeck, Fatoumata",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4156152171 , 107281552 , 66569 , 9781369045796 , 10149479 , 10149479", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369045796, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1813326489?accountid=14496," 0316 African literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0401 Literature"," 0316 African literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0401 Literature"," 0316 African literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0401 Literature",," 0316 African literature , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0401 Literature"," African literature , Cultural anthropology , Literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Cultural Studies , Economics , Fiction , Post-Colonial , Senegal",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Fiction+and+economics%0Ain+post-colonial+Senegal&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Seck%2C+Fatoumata&amp;isbn=9781369045796&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Improvising the Urban: Dance, Mobility, and Political Transformation in the Republic of Guinea","This dissertation examines urban sociality and political-economic change through the lens of expressive culture in the Republic of Guinea, where dance and music have long been entangled with politics. During Guinea's socialist period (1958-84), the state instituted a vast system of recruitment and competition, resulting in a dance form called ""Guinean ballet"" that became a symbol of the young nation. The socialist state also violently appropriated rural performance practices as key media of postcolonial nation building, capitalizing on the power these art forms commanded in the countryside. Thirty years after the end of socialism, despite the virtual disappearance of state funding for the arts, Guinean ballet is thriving in the capital city of Conakry, deployed by individual actors navigating a liberal capitalist economy. This dissertation uses the social and expressive configurations found in Conakry's dance community to examine the complex cultural afterlife of Guinean socialism,and to investigate what it means to live in a contemporary African city. It focuses ethnographically on a network of performing artists in Conakry working in troupes or ""ballets,"" whose practices were profoundly shaped by socialist cultural policy. More specifically, it engages a city-wide network of private ballets that were founded in the wake of state socialism, and the improvisational strategies that practitioners employ in dance and daily life as they navigate the uncertainties of a postsocialist, post-Structural Adjustment urban existence. Private ballets, while dismissed by the state, constitute the infrastructural bulk of Conakry's contemporary performing arts scene, and have effectively replaced the elaborate state-structured system that existed for training artists during the Revolution. These troupes exist at the margins of the state, yet are central to an emerging African urbanity and vibrant youth culture in Conakry. Generational divides articulated in speech and dance throughout the study illustrate how political-economic transformation maps into changing social dynamics. While elder artists trained during Guinea's socialist period understand dance as intimately connected to rural origins and socialist values, postsocialist youth in Conakry are developing expressive forms that both reflect and perform new circumstances and possibilities. They dance, as their elders did, in formal troupes and social ceremonies, but the troupes are no longer part of a nationalist political program, and the ceremonies invite individual improvisation that transgresses former norms of propriety and gendered movement, and questions ethnically inflected modes of constructing belonging. These young dancers, however, are not performing quintessential neoliberal subjecthood. The practices and perspectives of young dancers can be socially transgressive, but are also deeply marked by legacies of socialism. Contemporary ballet dance in Guinea, forged through the socialist Revolution, is a unique affective medium which both signals connection with the socialist past and performs an aspirational version of African modernity. In this ballet community, transnational migration is a distinctly postsocialist phenomenon and is shaping the landscape of possibility around professional dance in Conakry. When socialism ended in 1984, economic liberalization and Structural Adjustment meant a loss of state funding for the arts and spurred the privatization of troupes and mass migration of performers in the 1990s and 2000s. The recent outmigration of the country's best artists, motivated by changes in political regime and economic policy, is provoking a cascade of social transformations in Conakry's dance community, which I investigate along structural, aesthetic, and imaginative axes. The practice of Guinean ballet is richly textured with a long history of political and social significance, and this history, I argue, has imbued this art form with a sense of cosmopolitanism that is finding new expression among youth in a vastly transformed political economy. This dance is ideally situated to connect three major themes in anthropological scholarship which are usually treated separately: African urbanism, postsocialist studies, and transnational mobility. In so doing, it raises theoretical questions about creativity in authoritarian settings and about the nature of contemporary African urbanity, and asks how new configurations of power, wealth, and interests After the Cold War are understood and put in motion through both dancing and migrating bodies.",1814747054,,Dissertations & Theses," Cohen, Adrienne JordanCohenJordanAdrienneCohen, Adrienne Jordan",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4163428391 , 107286402 , 66569 , 9781369080964 , 10152966 , 10152966", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369080964, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1814747054?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance",," 0293 African Studies , 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0378 Dance"," African Studies , Cultural anthropology , Dance"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Africa , Dance , Political Economy , Post Socialism , Transnational Migration , Urbanization",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Improvising+the+Urban%3A+Dance%2C+Mobility%2C+and+Political+Transformation+in+the+Republic+of+Guinea&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Cohen%2C+Adrienne+Jordan&amp;isbn=9781369080964&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Discourse Analysis of Nigerian Feminism,"This study interprets the public perceptions of feminism and gender equality in Nigeria as reflected in the media. In recent times, the issue of gender equality has been subject to numerous debates in Nigeria. My interest in this issue stems from the increased awareness of feminism and a growing feminist movement in the country. This thesis details the popular opinions on feminism found on Nigerian blogs, online newspaper columns, social media and the likes. The purpose of this research was to (1) analyze feminism as a discourse in the Nigerian society (2) identify the existing gender issues (3) contribute to the growing body of transnational feminism. The findings reveal the dynamic interplay of gender and culture. The main discourses are centered on the relevance/irrelevance of feminism and the advocacy for the girl child rights. These findings have implications for the larger discourse regarding the correlation between culture and gender equality.

Against a backdrop of historical, racial, and religious struggle, congadeiros engender dignity and belonging through the musico-religious rituals of congado. Living on urban and rural peripheries of the Brazilian state of Minas Gerais, congadeiros typically come from a poor, semi-educated class and work as farmers, housekeepers, instrument makers, and hairdressers, among other trades. Music making is one of the most efficacious tools that congadeiros have to counteract social and political exclusion. From vibrant drumming and spirited dancing to introspective polyphony, congadeiros shape music in diverse ways to sound emotions, to redress oppression, and to negotiate their place in the world. Congado as song enunciates survival. In the past as well as in the twenty-first century, congadeiros have used song as a way to stake claims to belonging in local, national, and global spheres. Based on ten months of fieldwork with congadeiros across Minas Gerais in 2014, I explore how congadeiros cultivate particular rituals in purposeful and cohesive ways to not only say something about what it means to be poor, black, and marginalized, but also to say something profound about what it means to be religious, secular, and resilient. Congadeiros often sound their grievances and triumphs in loud, boisterous parades because they desire to engage in a process of religious, cultural, and musical translation. In many respects, congado as drumming, movement, prayer, and ecstatic song does the work of translation—of turning sensibilities into sound so that it recasts oppression as resiliency and myth as history. It is, furthermore, a process of translation that continues to reproduce congadeiros’ sense of worth at a profound level. We witness this process of translation through movement, particularly with regard to their processions. Congadeiros not only translate their devotion into song through processional music, they also translate their desire to belong in society by occupying space through parading.",1815041043,,Dissertations & Theses," Dempsey, Genevieve Eileen VirginiaDempseyEileen VirginiaGenevieveDempsey, Genevieve Eileen Virginia0000-0001-7463-0441",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4164539311 , 106140372 , 66569 , 9781339872766 , 10129385 , 10129385", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781339872766, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1815041043?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0318 Religion , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," 0318 Religion , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies",," 0318 Religion , 0413 Music , 0550 Latin American Studies"," Religion , Music , Latin American Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Devotion , Gender , Musical performance , Race",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+sacred+sound+of+congado%3A+Performing+songs+of+devotion%2C+race%2C+and+gender+in+Afro-Brazilian+religious+communities&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Dempsey%2C+Genevieve+Eileen+Virginia&amp;isbn=9781339872766&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Acting Out: Performative Politics in the Age of the New Left and the Counterculture,"Acting Out: Performative Politics in the Age of the New Left and Counterculture is concerned with the liminal space where acting out becomes acting up becomes enacting the revolution. This work uses case studies of groups such as the Living Theatre, the San Francisco Diggers, and the Yippies to trace the development of a performative politics, an expanding repertoire of political action that draws upon the ideas of everyday life as performance. These groups of cultural workers (writers, actors, musicians, and performance artists) were remarkably successful at accomplishing a fundamental goal of political movements for social change: getting people's attention and getting them to act out. It was through the medium of culture that they transmitted, across both geographic and temporal boundaries, powerful ideas about the existence of, and potential for resistance to, hegemonic modes of thinking and action. Through demonstrating the significant influence of these ideas and ways of acting this work challenges existing narratives within the history of the time period. These narratives have dismissed the Counterculture as silly and superfluous, asserted the failure of the radical movements of the Sixties more broadly, and in doing so drawn upon overly simplistic distinctions between cultural and political actors and modes of action. It is only through the blurring of such boundaries, enabled by interdisciplinary modes of analysis including history, media studies, cultural theory, performance studies and studies of social movements, that we can see clearly the accomplishments of the time period. Acting Out begins by tracing ideas and techniques that would be central to the New Left and the Counterculture back into the 1950s. From key sociological and psychological experiments and works within the academy to the theatrical world of performance art, and most especially the work of the Living Theatre, we see the spreading recognition and articulation of the performance of every life. This idea was taken up and utilized by the San Francisco Diggers. Drawing on theatrical modes of performance, through actions that combined politics and performance art in setting such as Free Stores, the Diggers attempted to transform daily life through the power of everyday acts, and in doing so provided a powerful model of political action that further problematizes the distinction between the New Left and the Counterculture. These new forms of political action were simultaneously embraced and resisted by a New Left frustrated by the effectiveness of traditional modes of political organizing and engagement. The Diggers had a particular influence on Abbie Hoffman, a founding member of the New York-based Yippies, who expanded the theatre of engagement from the neighborhood to the national level. In actions such as the ""Happening at the Stock Exchange"", the Yippies used the tools of media representation to their own ends. The role of the media is further explored in the transnational influence of countercultural ideas, where the soon-to-be writers of OZ Magazine in Australia and members of the London Diggers took the moral panic reporting on the emerging counterculture as an inspiration for the creation of anarchic, hippie spaces and modes of engagement. Acting Out ends by considering the legacies of performative politics beyond what is traditionally seen as countercultural moment. From the science fiction works of former hippie William Gibson to the Situationist creations of music industry icon Tony Wilson, and finally the drawing upon of anarchist traditions in the recent Occupy Movement, we see the enduring influence of these ideas and modes of action.",1819650071,,Dissertations & Theses," Hannon, Andrew GreenHannonGreenAndrewHannon, Andrew Green",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4183132241 , 107799802 , 66569 , 9781369157505 , 10160855 , 10160855", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369157505, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1819650071?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0641 Performing Arts"," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0641 Performing Arts",," 0323 American studies , 0337 American history , 0641 Performing Arts"," American studies , American history , Performing Arts"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Avant-Garde Theatre , Counterculture , Hippies , New Left , Post-War Avant-Garde",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Acting+Out%3A+Performative+Politics+in+the+Age+of+the+New+Left+and+the+Counterculture&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hannon%2C+Andrew+Green&amp;isbn=9781369157505&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Rebel preachers: The making of Islamic activism in Shī'ī Lebanon (1960-1985),"This study investigates the intellectual and organizational genesis of the Shī‘ī religious community that burgeoned in Lebanon in the 1970s. It demonstrates how several competing religious currents in the Shī‘ī community evolved through several overlapping phases of religious education, mobilization, revolutionization, and consolidation. Predominant academic opinions link the formation of new religious consciousness and new religious movements that succeeded the formation of Hizbullah in Shī‘ī Lebanon to Iran’s exportation of its “Islamic Revolution.” Not only does this study reopen the discussion on the transformation of forms of religiosity in Shī‘ī Lebanon, but it also elucidates the identity and origins of groups and ideas that constitute the contemporary Shī‘ī milieu that crystallized in the 1980s. This study, thus, offers a reconceptualization of present time orientations and positions in the religious field as products of an eventful past through analysis of several religious projects that appeared two full decades before the rise of Hizbullah. It looks at several religious paradigms that interacted in contexts of sectarianism, economic crises, and wars. Organizational and intellectual analysis explain the means by which the religious activists acquired legitimacy and reproduced, marketed, and delivered their views within the constraints of their social space, conditions of existence, changing political opportunity structures, and accumulating past socialization. Through analysis of religious structures, positions of activists within social structures, and religious production (ideas, discourses and practices), the study reveals how the activists developed a religious project that drew on earlier strategies, experiences and repertoires of the Shī‘ī Iranian, Iraqi, and Lebanese activists—including secular ones. This study links the eruption of religion in the Lebanese public sphere in the 1980s to a larger tide of global religious renaissance, which, in the Shī‘ī case, began around the middle of the Twentieth century in Iraq and Iran.",1824361430,,Dissertations & Theses," Al-Hage Ali, NabilAl-Hage AliNabilAl-Hage Ali, Nabil",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4198591651 , 108012972 , 66569 , 9781369140101 , 10159018 , 10159018", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369140101, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1824361430?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0512 Islamic Studies"," Middle Eastern history , Islamic Studies"," Social sciences , Amal , Fadlullah , Hizbullah , Islamic movement , Musa al-Sadr , Shi'i Lebanon",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Rebel+preachers%3A+The+making+of+Islamic+activism+in+Sh%C4%AB%27%C4%AB+Lebanon%0A%281960-1985%29&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Al-Hage+Ali%2C+Nabil&amp;isbn=9781369140101&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Between nation and state: Albanian associations from Ottoman origins to a Communist Party, 1880-1945","This dissertation addresses the broader antecedents of the Communist Party of Albania (CPA) as one of a number of associations whose experience was central to Albanian political history. This long experience dates back to the informal national associations formed in the Ottoman Empire of the late nineteenth century. The dissertation examines the role of these associations which, pursuing language rights and political representation through imperial state reforms, set a pattern that struggled to connect nation and state, rather than asserting the territorial demands for a nation-state familiar across the region. Starting out in the Ottoman Empire, but then maturing in the Albanian diaspora in Romania, Bulgaria, Egypt and the United States, this dissertation shows politically significant processes of longer-term adaptation that created informal associations as institutional structures able to channel collective action. It then traces the reframing of these patterns through their destruction in the Balkan Wars and the First World War to the emergence of communist associations in the interwar period and beyond. This dissertation is a sustained study that traces long-term Ottoman imperial political legacies in the Albanian successor state. The story of the associations, based on hitherto unexamined archival documents, shows that the Albanians possessed a far greater capacity for political mobilization that previously acknowledged by historians. Moreover, the dissertation successfully challenges the conventional wisdom that portrays the Albanians as irreparably divided along sectarian and regional faultlines. It finds that Albanian national activism was civic in character rather than ethnic as elsewhere in the Balkans. The Albanians fought to remain within a multinational framework because this afforded them political security, social advancement and potential economic growth. In the late Ottoman period, this political objective was manifested in the acceptance of the supranational imperial order whereas during the Second World War, in the aspiration to become members of the Comintern internationalist movement. Another important find, is the newly-discovered evidence concerning the founding of the CPA and its wartime conduct as an organization created and led by the Albanians themselves, albeit with Yugoslav ideological assistance under the transnational umbrella of the Comintern.",1824361445,,Dissertations & Theses," Mitrojorgji, LejnarMitrojorgjiLejnarMitrojorgji, Lejnar",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4198591601 , 108074922 , 66569 , 9781369140538 , 10159061 , 10159061", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369140538, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1824361445?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies"," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies"," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies",," 0335 European history , 0437 East European Studies"," European history , East European Studies"," Social sciences , Balkans , Communism , Diplomacy , Military , Nationalism & nation-building , Transnational political culture",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Between+nation+and+state%3A+Albanian+associations+from+Ottoman+origins+to+a+Communist+Party%2C+1880-1945&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Mitrojorgji%2C+Lejnar&amp;isbn=9781369140538&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The global muslim brotherhood in britain: a social movement?,"‘Non-violent Islamist extremism’ has become an important political issue in Britain in recent years. Since 2011, with the government’s counter-radicalisation strategy, Prevent, non-violent Islamist groups have been considered as a security risk for spreading a divisive ideology that can lead to violence. Concerns with these groups intensified in 2014 for their alleged role in providing the ‘mood music’ for the radicalisation of British Muslims joining the Islamic State’s insurgency. Yet, terrorism isn’t the only concern regarding non-violent Islamists in Britain. In the last few years, the government has expressed concerns about their impact on social cohesion and civil liberties, including women’s rights. It has also voiced concerns regarding non-violent Islamist extremism and entryism within key British institutions. In 2015, it created the Extremism Analysis Unit—the first official body dedicated to study violent and non-violent extremism—and published its first ‘Counter-Extremism Strategy’. The key protagonists of non-violent Islamist extremism allegedly include groups and individuals associated with the Muslim Brotherhood and Jama’at-i-Islami. Some analysts describe them as part of the ‘global Muslim Brotherhood’, but do they constitute a singular phenomenon, a social movement? Adopting a conceptual approach informed by New Social Movement theory and the sociology of Pierre Bourdieu, this thesis answers this question affirmatively, detailing how such groups and individuals are networked organisationally, bonded through ideological and cultural kinship, and united in a conflict of values with the British society and state. Using original interviews with prominent movement leaders, as well as primary sources, this thesis shows how it is not so much ‘Islamist’, in aspiring for an Islamic state, but concerned with institutionalising an Islamic worldview and moral framework throughout society. Its conflict with the government does not simply concern the control of state institutions, but the symbolic authority to legitimise a way of seeing, thinking and living.",1827523137,,Dissertations & Theses," Perry, Damon LeePerryLeeDamonPerry, Damon Lee",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4209474271 , 103780982 , 101309 , 10177518 , 10177518 , https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-global-muslim-brotherhood-in-britain(05f199f6-23d4-40c6-b0c6-a7cc0d54a3d7).html", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827523137?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/theses/the-global-muslim-brotherhood-in-britain(05f199f6-23d4-40c6-b0c6-a7cc0d54a3d7).html , (UMI)AAI10177518 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+global+muslim+brotherhood+in+britain%3A+a+social+movement%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perry%2C+Damon+Lee&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The making of Mexican America transational networks in the rise of mass migration 1900-1940,"Despite being the largest migratory movement between two states in modern history, the origins and operation of Mexican migration to the United States has not been a major research topic. We lack a comprehensive view of Mexican migration as it was established in early twentieth century and reproduced throughout the century as a system that reached from Texas borderlands to California and to western agricultural regions and beyond to Midwestern farming and industrial areas, a system that continued to be circular in nature even as permanent settlement increased, and which was in constant interaction with families, villages, and towns throughout Mexico. This interdisciplinary, bilingual, and transnational project is one of the first histories of the creation of migrant networks narrated from multiple geographic and institutional sites, analyzing the relationship between state agents, civic organizations, and migrants on both sides of the border. My project utilizes a statistical analysis of migration trends combined with qualitative research in order to show how migration arose as a mass phenomenon in Mexico and extended into the United States. This dissertation argues that large scale Mexican migration was created and operated through an interconnected transnational migrant economy made up of self-reinforcing local economic logics, information diffusion, and locally based social networks. I demonstrate that town-based interpersonal networks formed the engine that propelled and sustained large scale migration. Migrants needed transportation, capital, and information to travel north. Town-based networks provided all of these things. I follow the spread of migrant routes, explaining the creation of Mexican communities in the US Showing why communities were located where they are and their links to the larger economy of migrant labor before turning to Mexico and showing the effects of migration on sending communities. Migration evolved from a wave of mainly men into a broad based phenomenon, drawing in families and communities through remittances. I argue this is because a set of self-reinforcing economic logics were being created on both sides of the border. These logics are separate, but linked to the economic conditions that framed migration- the pull of the industrialization of the American West and the Mexican north with its relatively high wages- and the push of the chaos and violence of the Mexican revolution and Cristero Wars. Likewise, these logics could not have occurred without the demographic pressures of population growth in central Mexico, and the economic transformations of the Porfiriato. As more and more people participated in migration, they sent back information and remittances, which in turn made it easier for others to follow their path. Circular migration reinforced this dynamic as migrants returned home on a large scale, bringing back knowledge and experience. Together, these practices constituted the migrant economy and made central and central-north Mexico the engine of migration in the twentieth century. This new economy made it easier to move, but also tied many families and towns into continuous migrations in order to achieve economic stability. Ultimately this project shows the creation of the political economy of migrant labor between Mexico and the United States.",1827604271,,Dissertations & Theses," Morales, DanielMoralesDanielMorales, Daniel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4210033741 , 104405712 , 66569 , 9781369004205 , 10144840 , 10144840", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369004205, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827604271?accountid=14496," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history"," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history",," 0336 Latin American history , 0337 American history"," Latin American history , American history"," Social sciences , Borderlands , Labor , Mexican immigation , Mexican-americans , Migration , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+making+of+Mexican+America+transational+networks+in+the+rise+of+mass+migration+1900-1940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Morales%2C+Daniel&amp;isbn=9781369004205&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Close encounters: international exhibitions and the material culture of the british empire, c1880-1940","Apparitions of empire and imperial ideologies were deeply embedded in the International Exhibition, a distinct exhibitionary paradigm that came to prominence in the mid-nineteenth century. Exhibitions were platforms for the display of objects, the movement of people, and the dissemination of ideas across and between regions of the British Empire, thereby facilitating contact between its different cultures and societies. This thesis aims to disrupt a dominant understanding of International Exhibitions, which forwards the notion that all exhibitions, irrespective of when or where they were staged, upheld a singular imperial discourse (i.e. Greenhalgh 1988, Rydell 1984). Rather, this thesis suggests International Exhibitions responded to and reflected the unique social, political and economic circumstances in which they took place, functioning as cultural environments in which pressing concerns of the day were worked through. Understood thus, the International Exhibition becomes a space for self-presentation, serving as a stage from which a multitude of interests and identities were constructed, performed and projected. This thesis looks to the visual and material culture of the International Exhibition in order to uncover this more nuanced history, and foregrounds an analysis of the intersections between practices of exhibition-making and identity-making. The primary focus is a set of exhibitions held in Glasgow in the late-1880s and early-1900s, which extends the geographic and temporal boundaries of the existing scholarship. What is more, it looks at representations of Canada at these events, another party whose involvement in the International Exhibition tradition has gone largely unnoticed. Consequently, this thesis is a thematic investigation of the links between a municipality routinely deemed the ‘Second City of the Empire’ and a Dominion settler colony, two types of geographic setting rarely brought into dialogue. It analyses three key elements of the exhibition-making process, exploring how iconographies of ‘quasi-nationhood’ were expressed through an exhibition’s planning and negotiation, its architecture and its displays. This original research framework deliberately cuts across strata that continue to define conceptions of the British Empire, and pushes beyond a conceptual model defined by metropole and colony. Through examining International Exhibitions held in Glasgow in the late-Victorian and Edwardian periods, and visions of Canada in evidence at these events, the goal is to offer a novel intervention into the existing literature concerning the cultural history of empire, one that emphasises fluidity rather than fixity and which muddles the boundaries between centre and periphery.",1827873084,,Dissertations & Theses," Spooner, Rosemary GallSpoonerGallRosemarySpooner, Rosemary Gall",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4211390401 , 103854242 , 101309 , 10180351 , 10180351 , http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7386/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1827873084?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://theses.gla.ac.uk/7386/ , (UMI)AAI10180351 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Close+encounters%3A+international+exhibitions+and+the+material+culture+of+the+british+empire%2C+c1880-1940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Spooner%2C+Rosemary+Gall&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""""News that stays news"": Transformations of literature, gossip, and community in modernity","Recent decades have demonstrated a renewed interest in gossip research from scholars in psychology, sociology, and anthropology who argue that gossip—despite its popular reputation as trivial, superficial “women’s talk”—actually serves crucial social and political functions such as establishing codes of conduct and managing reputations. My dissertation draws from and builds upon this contemporary interdisciplinary scholarship by demonstrating how the modernists incorporated and transformed the popular gossip of mass culture into literature, imbuing it with a new power and purpose. The foundational assumption of my dissertation is that as the nature of community changed at the turn of the twentieth century, so too did gossip. Although usually considered to be a socially conservative force that serves to keep social outliers in line, I argue that modernist writers transformed gossip into a potent, revolutionary tool with which modern individuals could advance and promote the progressive ideologies of social, political, and artistic movements. Ultimately, the gossip of key American expatriates (Henry James, Djuna Barnes, Janet Flanner, and Ezra Pound) became a mode of exchanging and redefining creative and critical values for the artists and critics who would follow them. From abroad, moreover, these writers examined various definitions of “Americanness,” and much of their work contributed to Americans’ increasing sense of self-awareness and self-confidence on the international stage. How is modernism the product of gossip? What does the relationship between literature and gossip illuminate for us about the experience of community and nationhood in modernity? Can literature itself be considered gossip? Just as importantly: can criticism?

Employing a phenomenological approach to examine lived experience, this study explores: 1) how American media aids African pre-migrants in constructing the United States as a paradise rooted in the American Dream; 2) immigrants' responses when the 'imagined paradise' does not match their American realities; 3) the ways Nigerian films articulate a distinctly African cultural experience that enables immigrants from various nations to identify with the stories reflected on screen; and, 4) how viewing Nollywood films in social media platforms creates a digital sub-diaspora that enables a reconnection with African culture when life in the United States causes intellectual and emotional dissonance. Using voices of members from the African immigrant communities currently living in the United States and analysis of their online media consumption, this study ultimately argues that the Nigerian film industry, a transnational cinema with consumers across the African diaspora, continuously creates a fantastical affective world that offers immigrants tools to connect with their African cultural values. Nollywood films culturally appose traditional values with both the delights and dilemmas of globalization to reveal a recognizable and relatable fictional realm for many Africans dealing with the vestiges of colonial rule. With hyper-dramatic plots that glorify and critique life on the continent, Nollywood becomes a means to an end for African immigrants residing in the often unfamiliar culture of the United States. Surfing YouTube for Nollywood films or logging into subscription based platforms like IrokoTV and Amazon Prime, which carries Nollywood titles thanks to partnerships with IrokoTV, can foil the incongruity between the paradise America is supposed to be, the realities of American life, and the immigrant's desire to preserve an African cultural identity while striving for the American dream. Nollywood viewing online helps solidify the industry as a transnational movement where immigrants in the United States use technology to watch films, connect with their cultural values, and become a part of a global digital community, or sub-diaspora, consisting of other immigrants around the world and individuals on the African continent.",1829545764,,Dissertations & Theses," Arthur, Tori O.ArthurO.ToriArthur, Tori O.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4217353551 , 105839612 , 66569 , 9781369016642 , 10146303 , 10146303", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369016642, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1829545764?accountid=14496," 0293 African Studies , 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," 0293 African Studies , 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies",," 0293 African Studies , 0323 American studies , 0631 Ethnic studies , 0646 Web Studies , 0708 Mass communications , 0900 Film studies"," African Studies , American studies , Ethnic studies , Web Studies , Mass communications , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Africa , American immigration , Film , Nigeria , Nollywood , Social media",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+reimagined+paradise%3A+African+immigrants+in+the+United+States%2C+Nollywood+film%2C+and+the+digital+remediation+of+%27home%27&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Arthur%2C+Tori+O.&amp;isbn=9781369016642&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Community of Art, Community of Justice: Understanding the Social and Political Impact of the Arts in Urban Neighborhoods","Art can be a catalyzing force in advancing justice. It facilitates communication, creating new avenues for cooperation and political action. Through case studies of neighborhoods in two U.S. cities, this dissertation explores the unique role of art in support of justice uniting migrant groups who are forging new identities along with longstanding residents who strive to sustain their community as it changes. Corona is a neighborhood exemplary of its home borough of Queens in New York City because of its international diversity, rapidly changing demographics, and limited access to resources and opportunities. In Corona, art is a tool employed to address tensions arising from persistent economic and social disparities. Research sites include: Immigrant Movement International, run by a horizontally structured community council to elevate migrant voice; Corona Plaza, a reclaimed public space activated for community reimagining; intergenerational printmaking collective Mobile Print Power whose members interact with residents to address critical issues. These projects advocate for restructuring of the socio-political forces that marginalize migrants. Many are connected to the Queens Museum, an institution challenged to maintain a delicate balance between commitment to community engagement and art world renown. A comparative case study of the Upper Ninth Ward in New Orleans is synthesized with analysis of Corona to generate findings; implications for policy targeting city officials, organizations, funders and all stakeholders are inferred. Three main findings of the research are: 1) Legacies of cultural organizing persist as enculturated implicit patterns that inform current art projects and programs, 2) Adoption of a flexible and intersectional art praxis enables residents, artists, city officials, art administrators, and community organizers to respond to critical issues in the community, and 3) Art-making advances individuals within communities, both in the individual’s struggle for identity as well in facilitating voice in political processes. The dissertation addresses a gap between the existing research in cultural policy and art history fields, drawing on an intersectional theoretical framework of aesthetic justice and spatial justice to analyze the two cases. Attention is drawn to the unique ability of art to facilitate exchange of information and engage with disparate groups in working toward justice.",1830485625,,Dissertations & Theses," Taylor, Johanna Kate JakesTaylorKate JakesJohannaTaylor, Johanna Kate Jakes",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4221212351 , 105866232 , 66569 , 9781369179170 , 10163145 , 10163145", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369179170, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1830485625?accountid=14496," 0424 Arts Management , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," 0424 Arts Management , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," 0424 Arts Management , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning",," 0424 Arts Management , 0630 Public policy , 0999 Urban planning"," Arts Management , Public policy , Urban planning"," Social sciences , New Orleans , New York City , Social justice , Socially engaged art , Urban communities , Urban policy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Community+of+Art%2C+Community+of+Justice%3A+Understanding+the+Social+and+Political+Impact+of+the+Arts+in+Urban+Neighborhoods&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Taylor%2C+Johanna+Kate+Jakes&amp;isbn=9781369179170&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Socio-ecological drivers of resource selection and habitat use by moose in interior Alaska,"Sustainably managing wildlife with diverse utilization values is one of the greatest challenges facing contemporary wildlife management. These challenges can be amplified under changing environmental and socio-economic conditions. In Alaska, boreal forest systems are experiencing rapid change as a result of climate warming. Alaska’s boreal region has warmed twice as rapidly as the global average, affecting a host of processes including an increase in wildfire frequency, extent, and severity. Wildfire is the most common ecological disturbance in the Alaskan boreal forest and an important driver of landscape heterogeneity, burning on average 1 to 2 million acres per year. Fire severity is a particularly important factor dictating the regeneration of deciduous species, and one that can influence the overall quality of habitat for herbivores, such as moose ( Alces alces ). However, the relationships between the availability and duration of biomass production and moose habitat selection are largely unknown. Additionally, the effects of fire on wildlife resources in Alaska can have important consequences for boreal social-ecological systems as well. Fire-related changes to the community composition of forest stands would likely affect the densities of species that human communities rely on for hunting and trapping. In Interior Alaska, where natural wildfire is the primary means of increased browse production for moose, managers may want to consider incorporating burns into management plans while paying particular attention to hunter accessibility. However, an increase in hunter activity into moose habitat could result in changes to moose distribution and activity patterns near trails and roads. To examine these questions I utilized telemetry data from 26 moose along with methods in spatial ecology, plant-animal interactions, resource selection and human dimensions of wildlife research to predict the influence of an ecological disturbance (fire) and an anthropogenic disturbance (hunter activity) on moose habitat use. I used dynamic Brownian bridge movement models (dBBMM) in conjunction with browse assessment surveys to examine how fire severity, via its control over vegetation composition, forage production and nutritional quality, affect habitat use patterns of moose across their seasonal home ranges and core use areas. To assess the effects of hunter activity on moose habitat use, I created fine-scale step-selection models to test whether habitat selection and movement patterns were affected by spatio-temporal variation in risk from hunting activity. Additionally, from August-October, I used a camera trap array to collect field data on human activity (off-road vehicles, automobiles, 4x4 trucks, dirt bikes, and hunters afoot) together with the RandomForests algorithm to create high-resolution hunter distribution models. Finally, to integrate my research within a social-ecological framework, I examined the interactions between wildfire, forage production and hunter access on management scenarios overtime. In winter, moose preferred low-severity sites more than high and moderate-severity sites, but in summer, moose selected for high-severity sites. Forage biomass production ranged from 62 to 243 kg/ha/yr across all sites during winter within the Hajdukovich Creek Burn, but production and availability varied depending on fire severity and browse species. These results indicate that differing distributions of wildfire severity across a landscape can create a dynamic, mosaic of habitat patches that may optimize and extend the value of burns over time for moose.

Where historians have framed the “tramp,” the vagrant figure that appears during this period, in terms of social and economic upheaval on the national level, my reading reveals the interdisciplinary and international framing of this discussion. According to sources on both sides of the Atlantic, the tramp’s movements on the rail and (more importantly) on transatlantic ships posed a problem to the state’s oversight of economic activity in an era of burgeoning globalism. I argue that writers in the US and Britain in view of this threat resort to a comparative framework—consisting of both governmental and experiential responses to vagrancy—to visualize and control the mobility of this fringe population. By tracking the codification of vagrancy, my dissertation provides crucial insight into the process by which demographic categories are created, codified, and subjected to disciplinary power. “Vagrant Narratives” charts the emergence of tramps from the end of the nineteenth century to their subsequent codification as migrant laborers in the twentieth century. I foreground the literature and policies formed in response to the dramatic rise in unemployed populations across the industrialized West following the Great Depressions of 1873 and 1929. The welfare policies that followed represented at once the pinnacle of progressive politics and the culmination of state regulation over the lives of Americans and Britons. Writers including Mark Twain, George Orwell and John Steinbeck welcomed such legislation, joining legal and health officials in helping to organize—and provide the ethical foundation for—the welfare system. Cross-disciplinary treatment of vagrancy was pivotal in this process. For government officials, vagrants confounded the notion of the productive citizen—the cornerstone of the social safety net—by continually refusing settled employment. Where legal and medical documents see this itinerancy as a problem, tramps themselves write texts celebrating their non-productive form of labor on aesthetic grounds. On the basis of this art, the tramp represents both a threat to the definition of the citizen as a productive member of society and an appeal to widen the terms of inclusion within the nation-state. In view of this debate, I establish a nineteenth-century precedent for the discourse surrounding migrancy and migrant populations during the construction (and subsequent dismantling of) the welfare state in the mid-twentieth century.",1832894006,,Dissertations & Theses," Yazell, Bryan GaryYazellGaryBryanYazell, Bryan Gary",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4229627421 , 108677342 , 66569 , 9781369310832 , 10182768 , 10182768", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369310832, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1832894006?accountid=14496," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature",," 0295 Comparative literature , 0298 Modern literature , 0591 American literature , 0593 British and Irish literature"," Comparative literature , Modern literature , American literature , British and Irish literature"," Language, literature and linguistics , Law and literature , Migrancy , Social sciences , Transatlantic literature , Welfare policy",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Vagrant+Narratives%3A+Governing+the+Welfare+Subject+in+the+US+and+Britain%2C+1880-1940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yazell%2C+Bryan+Gary&amp;isbn=9781369310832&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Organizing for Political Empowerment? Explaining the Effects of Women's Organizations on Women's Political Participation in Guatemala,"Prominent development agencies, including the World Bank and the United Nations, agree gender equality and women’s political empowerment is central to achieving positive social and economic outcomes. To politically empower women in the developing world, international aid has increasingly turned to decentralized, bottom-up approaches. Consequently, the past twenty years have witnessed a “boom” in nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) specializing in gender policy assessment, project execution, and social services delivery. Though proponents of bottom-up approaches suggest organizational involvement will empower women to act politically, neither research on women’s political participation nor on the political effects of NGOs has empirically validated this assumption. Thus, it is still unclear whether, or how, women’s collective organizing empowers women to act politically both within and outside of formal institutional channels. This project employs a mixed methods approach that combines case studies, participant observation and informal interview techniques with survey data to analyze and explain the relationship between women’s organizations and women’s political empowerment in the Guatemalan context. I conclude from these analyses that women’s organizations in democratizing states generally, and in Guatemala specifically, do empower women to participate politically, but the effects across institutional and non-institutional acts differ. In democratizing states where institutions are weak and neoliberal reforms and international women’s movements support women’s organizing outside of institutional politics, women’s organizations are most likely to empower members to exercise political agency via non-institutional political action. While women’s organizational experiences tend to reinforce members’ negative perceptions of institutional politics, organizations empower women to act politically by enhancing individual motivations, capacities, and opportunities for non-institutional political participation.

Using event history analysis, I investigate rates of initiated engagement in activity sectors and rates of founding new international ministries, focusing on 1970 to 2008 for the former and 1982 to 2007 for the latter. Concerning activities, heterogeneity between activity sectors determines the extent of influence of external environmental processes, such as density dependence and sector exits, and internal factors, such as size and religious identity. Only sector exits has a consistently negative effect on transition rates, and only in the five sectors where its effects are significant. In addition, I find that declining sectors do not exhibit anticipated ecological density-dependence and vicarious learning effects through sector exits. Religious identity, between Evangelical and non-Evangelicals, plays an important role in rates of initiated engagement but, as with other factors, the direction of its effect depends on the sector. Rates of founding new international ministries more consistently fit neoinstitutional and ecological expectations. Density has a curvilinear inverted U-shaped effect on founding rates, age has a negative effect, and size a positive one. Vicarious learning from exits has no effect, however, suggesting that founding rates are independent of ministry failures. Internationally, agencies involved in evangelism tend to found ministries in countries with low proportions of Protestants, while agencies involved in relief and development gravitate towards underdeveloped countries. Additionally, agencies tend to move towards rather than away from countries suffering from wars, religious polarization, and government restrictions on religious freedom. Collectively, these results contribute: 1) empirically to a better understanding of Christian organizations operating transnationally, 2) theoretically by demonstrating the extent to which organizational and environmental processes typically used to explain secular organizational behavior can also be used in studying religious organizations, and 3) practically, by helping agencies situate themselves within the broader picture of Christian missions and by informing political leaders and decision-makers of the international locations where American Christians tend to operate.",1835779677,,Dissertations & Theses," Bok, JaredBokJaredBok, Jared",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4237971221 , 108836482 , 66569 , 9781369323337 , 10290084 , 10290084", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369323337, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1835779677?accountid=14496," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior"," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior",," 0318 Religion , 0626 Sociology , 0703 Organizational behavior"," Religion , Sociology , Organizational behavior"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Missions , Neoinstitutionalism , Organizational ecology , Protestantism , Social movements , Transnationalism",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Religious+Organizations+Crossing+Boundaries%3A+The+Centrifugal+Expansion+of+U.S.-based+Mission+Agencies&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bok%2C+Jared&amp;isbn=9781369323337&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Borrowed Children, Entrusted Girls: Legal Encounters with Girlhood in French West Africa, c. 1900 - 1941","In the colony of Dahomey, the modern-day Republic of Benin, French colonial laws and West African societies interacted in unpredictable ways which altered girls’ vulnerability to labor exploitation and sexual abuse. In contrast to recent scholarship focusing on twentieth century efforts to “modernize” girlhood elsewhere in Africa, this dissertation shows that Dahomeans strove to find new ways to regulate the “traditional” girlhood norms of child circulation, girl hawkers, and vodun initiation within the evolving colonial legal framework of the 1920s through 1940s. The colonial tribunal operated as a cross cultural space where a masculine audience of indigenous assessors and French administrators interpreted girls’ narrations of abuse through the filters of both Dahomean ideas about proper female maturation and European stereotypes of African femininity. This dissertation is a socio-legal history of girlhood in colonial Dahomey during the first half of the twentieth century. The nearly two hundred cartons of remaining legal documents from colonial Dahomey contained in the National Archives of Benin and Senegal for the 1920s-1950s reveal that diverse groups of actors, including market women, customary chiefs, junior men, lineage heads, vodun spiritual leaders, and parents sought to protect and expand their own abilities to use girls as a means upon which to build economic wealth, social prestige, and political power. Juridical records, newspapers, ethnographies, official inquiries, and oral interviews all demonstrate that in Dahomey, colonialism reshaped traditional girlhood norms. This dissertation analyzes how Dahomeans defended practices of entrusting girls to households as laborers and to cult-houses as initiates. In doing so, Dahomeans rejected aspirations to a model of “modern” girlhood dominated by nuclear families and school going. By examining girlhood as an identity formulated in colonial legal arenas during a foundational moment in both the international children’s rights and women’s rights movements this dissertation provides new insights into how Africans, though largely silent and absent in international forums, expressed and enacted dissenting viewpoints on developing global consensuses about ideals of childhood and gender.",1835816435,,Dissertations & Theses," Reuther, Jessica CatherineReutherCatherineJessicaReuther, Jessica Catherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4238029271 , 108838322 , 66569 , 9781369323825 , 10290133 , 10290133", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369323825, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1835816435?accountid=14496," 0331 African history , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0331 African history , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history"," 0331 African history , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history",," 0331 African history , 0453 Womens studies , 0582 Modern history"," African history , Womens studies , Modern history"," Social sciences , Colonial law , Dahomey , French west africa , Girlhood , Republic of Benin , Sex crimes",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Borrowed+Children%2C+Entrusted+Girls%3A+Legal+Encounters+with+Girlhood+in+French+West+Africa%2C+c.+1900+-+1941&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Reuther%2C+Jessica+Catherine&amp;isbn=9781369323825&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Effects of Host Movement on Pathogen Population Structure and Epidemic Dynamics,"This dissertation examines how host movement affects epidemic spread by characterizing spatial genetic patterns in pathogen populations. When hosts are highly mobile, measures of spatial distance should additionally incorporate the magnitude and frequency of movement between locations. Seasonal influenza A virus presents an ideal system with which to study the effects of mobility on viral dynamics due to extensive human transportation networks. To fully understand the processes of pathogen invasion and spread, a detailed understanding of the ecological and evolutionary factors that control distributional limits is necessary. I find that pathogens are not uniformly distributed across their hosts’ ranges, and that pathogen evolutionary responses to conditions across the geographic range are modulated by both abiotic and biotic factors that differ across the landscape. An initial investigation of regional scale human mobility in the United States suggests that epidemics spread along predictable pathways defined by commuter volume. However, similar patterns are not detected for influenza epidemics in Europe. An analysis of the major European regional transportation networks reveals that both networks possess characteristics that facilitate long-distance transmission and international mixing of influenza. This analysis also uncovers important complexities associated with the spatial analysis of genetic sequence data, and a re-examination of US influenza epidemics leads to the conclusion that spatial structure based on mobility is not yet detectable in this system using the current genetic data. Finally, the effects of vaccination strategies targeted at different host age and social groups are evaluated using a stochastic metapopulation model simulating a city-suburb system. I find that targeting children provides the greatest benefits in terms of reducing incidence, but also show that vaccination of groups of employed adults provides similar reductions in incidence and additionally delays the speed and timing of inter-community spread when epidemics are severe and vaccine doses are limited. I conclude that the intricacies of epidemic spread make the detection of spatial genetic patterns based on movement networks difficult, but that the greater availability of high-resolution spatial genetic data will lead to a more detailed understanding of pathogen ecological and evolutionary dynamics.",1841896380,,Dissertations & Theses," Bozick, BrookeBozickBrookeBozick, Brooke",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4256968961 , 108840062 , 66569 , 9781369299564 , 10181344 , 10181344", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369299564, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1841896380?accountid=14496," 0329 Ecology , 0412 Evolution and Development"," 0329 Ecology , 0412 Evolution and Development"," 0329 Ecology , 0412 Evolution and Development",," 0329 Ecology , 0412 Evolution and Development"," Ecology , Evolution and Development"," Biological sciences , Human mobility , Influenza , Networks , Phylogenetics , Spatial ecology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Effects+of+Host+Movement+on+Pathogen+Population+Structure+and+Epidemic+Dynamics&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Bozick%2C+Brooke&amp;isbn=9781369299564&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The transcendence of Taiwanese identity: A study of Hou Hsiao-Hsien's films,"After Japan ceded sovereignty over Taiwan post World War Two, the Nationalists from China took over control of Taiwan and shaped its government and identity. The Japanese assimilation influences that lingered among the Taiwanese elites became a backdrop to the rise of violence, such as that seen in the 2-28 Incident and White Terror, and to a Taiwanese nationalistic discourse such as that seen in the hsiang- t’u literature, a genre of Taiwanese literature from the Taiwanese Literature Movement that emphasized a distinct Taiwanese culture, sent clashing native Taiwanese and Nationalists for the struggle of power and identity. In this thesis, the research question is how Taiwan’s unique and contested identities are represented in A City of Sadness and Good Men Good Women of Hou Hsiao-Hsien’s films and how they reflect the development of Taiwan’s multi-complex identity from hsiang-t’u literature to the Taiwanese New Wave. In methodology, what will be examined is 1) the external historical context of the films and subject matter of the 2-28 Incident of 1947, hsiang-t’u literature, and New Wave Movement with 2) the internal analysis of languages, gender topics, memory, narrative structures, and Hou’s auteur style. This thesis analyzes how these factors of cinema and identity are interconnected with the Taiwanese social and political environment and nationhood, which have prompted Taiwanese citizens to seek a liberalization of politics and culture after martial law was abolished in 1987. Hou’s movies illustrate that Taiwan’s identity could no longer be described as the binary oppositions from the nationalistic discourse in hsiang-t’u literature, but as an ever-changing multidimensional flow of cultures and nations seen in gender and heteroglossia across the new global order.",1841909970,,Dissertations & Theses," Tsai, Stefan B.TsaiB.StefanTsai, Stefan B.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4257032071 , 109184352 , 66569 , 9781369150674 , 10160149 , 10160149", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369150674, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1841909970?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0900 Film studies"," Asian Studies , Film studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Heteroglossia , Hsiang-t'u literature , Hsiao-Hsien, Hou , Taiwanese identity , Taiwanese new cinema",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+transcendence+of+Taiwanese+identity%3A+A+study+of+Hou+Hsiao-Hsien%27s+films&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tsai%2C+Stefan+B.&amp;isbn=9781369150674&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The radical south: Grassroots activism, ethnicity, and literary form, 1960-1980","“The Radical South” examines the art and writings of Civil-Rights-era social movements and locates U.S. based political structures in a hemispheric and global network. I reveal that the Civil Rights Movement, ethnic nationalism, and second-wave feminism were not separate entities; rather, the cultural work of activists was an intersectional effort that defied national strategies, such as non-violent protest and race-based separatism, that were often determined by their urban counterparts. Thus, I argue that new political aesthetics emerged from grassroots activism and set in motion ethnic and racial cultural expressions that embraced multiple, even conflicting, identities. As much as this art was placed within a local context, its political and artistic aesthetics were also inspired by global revolutionary movements in places such as Cuba and the Caribbean, Spain, and Ghana. Whether I am looking at experimental theater, consciousness-raising documents, or novels, I show how this flexible approach to political ideology better represented the pragmatic realities of everyday life, even if it also meant challenging their popular-front vision of solidarity. “The Radical South” moves chronologically through Freedom Summer and the 1960s to early eighties “third world” feminism. In my first chapter, the Free Southern Theater, an integrated theater group established in Mississippi in 1963, emerges as a major innovator of what I call visual jazz, which combined avant-garde theater with civil rights activism. In the second and third chapters, I look at novels by Julian Mayfield and Jose Yglesias, both of which insist on the specificities of local forms of oppression, community memory, and familial bonds against the more abstracting vision of a global Marxist struggle. In the final chapter, I demonstrate how Toni Cade Bambara’s 1980 novel The Salt Eaters by embracing the paradox of what I call conflictual solidarity, a process by which dissenting voices collect together to challenge the structures that unite them.",1841916706,,Dissertations & Theses," Fielder, ElizabethFielderElizabethFielder, Elizabeth",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4257045081 , 106951842 , 66569 , 9781369153736 , 10160466 , 10160466", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369153736, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1841916706?accountid=14496," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0323 American studies , 0591 American literature , 0631 Ethnic studies"," American studies , American literature , Ethnic studies"," Language, literature and linguistics , Social sciences , Activism , African american literature , Civil rights movement , Cultural studies , Multi-ethnic literature",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+radical+south%3A+Grassroots+activism%2C+ethnicity%2C+and+literary+form%2C+1960-1980&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Fielder%2C+Elizabeth&amp;isbn=9781369153736&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Building in public: Critical reconstruction and the rebuilding of Berlin after 1990,"Reconstructing Berlin’s ruined contours after 1990 was one of the most important ways that reunified Germany made a public display of its relationship to the violence wrought by both the Nazis and East Germany during the twentieth century. By integrating historical forms into new buildings in the city’s commercial center, Berlin’s urban planners hoped to show the world that the nation had transcended totalitarianism and was worthy of a prominent place in the new global order. In order to achieve this vision, they adopted an approach called “Critical Reconstruction,” which required architects to follow rigid design standards based on traditional building typologies. In doing so, they also sought to rein in a flood of eager international investors who threatened to turn central Berlin into a landscape of flashy, corporate experiments. However, because of its strict insistence on historical styles, its ambivalence towards – if not affinity for – Nazi architecture, as well as its rejection of contemporary movements such as Deconstructivism, Critical Reconstruction was interpreted by many observers as reactionary and dangerously conservative. Historians and social scientists commonly refer to it as a controversial, backward-looking representation of German national identity. In this dissertation, I fundamentally reassess the discourse of Critical Reconstruction and argue that this so-called “conservative” turn in Berlin city planning practice was in actuality driven by socially progressive planners making a failed attempt to shape a new democratic society through the regulation of built form. My research thus casts doubt on one of the most central post-Enlightenment claims about architecture: that its aesthetic qualities can both directly represent and influence people and politics. Critical Reconstruction is mentioned often in recent histories of Berlin, and a handful of architectural historians have also examined isolated aspects of its deployment in terms of its relationship to trends in architecture and urban planning. However, without considering how it functioned discursively on multiple levels and in diverse arenas (professional, economic, and political), scholarly portrayals of Critical Reconstruction are reductive at best; at worst, these accounts risk reinscribing the same rigid and simplistic view of Berlin’s planning culture that they seek to critique. My project offers the first detailed examination of Critical Reconstruction as both a public discourse and a planning methodology, showing how planners’ endeavors to revive Berlin’s landscape in a socially responsible way ultimately gave rise to the opposite: a landscape of homogenous commercial buildings whose construction mainly served corporate interests, while simultaneously bolstering Berlin’s connections with the worst facets of its own history. Additionally, as discussions in the national media revealed Critical Reconstruction’s formal affinities with fascist architecture, suspicions grew amongst the general public that both this theory’s aesthetics and its authors also harbored authoritarian tendencies. The city that resulted from Critical Reconstruction’s intervention was thus, ultimately, a hyper-capitalist landscape that harkened back stylistically to the very moment in its violent history that Berlin desperately wanted to symbolically supersede. This research goes beyond one-dimensional depictions of Critical Reconstruction as a unilateral statement about German identity, revealing its status as a set of planning tactics situated within a network of conflicting institutional and political formations. As such, it also addresses two fundamental problems faced by architects and planners in the global age: how to productively contend with the forces of capital while advocating for sustainable local growth, and how to make buildings into legible signifiers of politically acceptable narratives about a nation’s history and identity without risking public and professional misinterpretation. The case of Critical Reconstruction, I demonstrate, illustrates just how difficult such a contradictory set of tasks can be; indeed, the means of architecture and urban planning may be wholly inadequate for such a monumental undertaking.",1842431281,,Dissertations & Theses," Hohensee, Naraelle KristinHohenseeKristinNaraelleHohensee, Naraelle Kristin",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4258902561 , 100267712 , 66569 , 9781369169034 , 10162054 , 10162054", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369169034, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1842431281?accountid=14496," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning",," 0377 Art history , 0729 Architecture , 0999 Urban planning"," Art history , Architecture , Urban planning"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Architectural history , Berlin architectural history , Berlin urban planning history , Post-modern berlin architecture , Post-wall berlin , Urban planning history",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Building+in+public%3A+Critical+reconstruction+and+the+rebuilding+of+Berlin+after+1990&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Hohensee%2C+Naraelle+Kristin&amp;isbn=9781369169034&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Chinese Migrant Workers in Kenya: Their Health Status and Access to Health Care,"The international movement of people is an essential part of a globalizing world. The increasing migration of population creates new challenges for global health systems, which have to adapt in order to remain responsive. China now has more people traveling or working overseas than at any other moment in its history. With 35 million Chinese living overseas and more than 800,000 Chinese migrant workers temporarily employed abroad, Chinese migrants face challenges and possible inequalities in health care access globally. In this study, we found that the general social and health status of Chinese migrants in Kenya is relatively good, but they still encounter barriers in accesses to health care in the country. Our study showed that most of the Chinese migrants are young adult males who are relatively wealthy but have little health insurance to cover them. They are also well-educated and are typically employed by construction companies. The health status of these migrants is relatively better than the Kenyan population as well as the population in China.28 However, many of them are living alone and experience barriers to health care including language barrier and a poor perception of health services in Kenya.",1844066025,,Dissertations & Theses," Song, DuoSongDuoSong, Duo",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4263429341 , 103624262 , 66569 , 9781369170283 , 10162231 , 10162231", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369170283, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1844066025?accountid=14496," 0342 Asian Studies , 0573 Public health"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0573 Public health"," 0342 Asian Studies , 0573 Public health",," 0342 Asian Studies , 0573 Public health"," Asian Studies , Public health"," Social sciences , Health and environmental sciences , Chinese migrants , Health access , Health status",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Chinese+Migrant+Workers+in+Kenya%3A+Their+Health+Status+and+Access+to+Health+Care&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Song%2C+Duo&amp;isbn=9781369170283&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Changing Seasons of Produce Distribution: An Investigation into the Past, Present, and Future of the Produce Supply Chain in California","In recent years, a growing number of social groups, government agencies, academic scholars, and individual consumers have directed intense criticism towards the structure of the conventional food system, labeling the system as distorted and unjust. Their efforts are often broadly labeled part of the “alternative food movement”. Much of the alternative food movement’s attention has focused on producers and consumers, and the direct linkages between the two. Examples of these direct linkages include farmers' markets, Community Supported Agriculture and farmstands. Yet, there is growing concern that these efforts are not enough, especially since less than 0.5% of all agricultural products sold in the United States are sold through direct marketing (U.S. Department of Agriculture National Agricultural Statistics Service 2012). These concerns point to a need to better understand the complex supply chain through which the vast majority of food, and in particular fresh fruits and vegetables, travels to reach end consumers. Namely there is a need to better understand the intermediates that stand between producers and consumers. Those actors that occupy the middle, referred to as intermediaries, play a unique role in the ongoing battle for knowledge, authority, and regulation in the food system. Simply by their position in the supply chain, intermediaries have the potential to act as mediators of power between producers and buyers. Power, as it is defined for the purposes of this study, is the ability of actors to influence the governance structure of the supply chain, thereby affecting the supply and demand of products traveling through those supply chains. Through the theoretical framework of agrarian political economy, and drawing on the methodology utilized in William Friedland’s commodity systems analysis and Gary Gereffi’s global value chains, I investigate the development of California’s fresh fruit and vegetable growers and intermediaries and their progressive struggle to maintain legitimacy and relevancy in the increasingly concentrated and vertically integrated food system. My findings show that there exists a plurality of intermediary actors in the produce supply chain that do not neatly fall into the binary of alternative/conventional and that the reliance on this simplistic understanding of the food system is detrimental to efforts to create a more equitable and just food system.",1845296161,,Dissertations & Theses," Christensen, Elizabeth O.ChristensenO.ElizabethChristensen, Elizabeth O.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4267816241 , 108714082 , 66569 , 9781369202830 , 10165907 , 10165907", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369202830, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1845296161?accountid=14496, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics, 0503 Agricultural economics,, 0503 Agricultural economics, Agricultural economics," Social sciences , Distribution , Fresh fruit and vegetables , Intermediaries , Produce , Supply chain",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Changing+Seasons+of+Produce+Distribution%3A+An+Investigation+into+the+Past%2C+Present%2C+and+Future+of+the+Produce+Supply+Chain+in+California&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Christensen%2C+Elizabeth+O.&amp;isbn=9781369202830&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Cabinet of Monkies: Dancing Politics in Anglo Culture, from Jacobite to Jacobin and Royalist to Republican","Dance has long been known to play a significant role in the social lives of men and women in colonial British America. What historians have largely failed to note is the integral nature of dance, in particular the longways English country form, to the realm of politics and the formation of national identity. From the earliest days of its dissemination in print, English country dance served a political purpose. In 1651, under Oliver Cromwell’s dour Protectorate government, Royalists like publisher John Playford used dance as a subtle form of resistance. Urging the public to remember the monarchy fondly and to join together in a quintessentially English pastime, Playford’s English Dancing Master created an imagined community of political dissenters. The Playford manuals set the standard for the politicization of dance in Anglo culture, both in the politically-charged dance titles they contained and in the intended function of dance performance itself. This awareness of dance’s potential and the tendency to employ it for political ends were carried across the Atlantic to England’s North American colonies. In the years preceding the American Revolution, as well as during the war itself, the ballroom became a political space to a heightened degree. While minuets established a clear social hierarchy, country dances broke it down into more democratic forms. Codes of conduct at assemblies allowed attendees (especially women) to publicize their political allegiances through their dress, behavior, and dance selection. Both the British and the Americans, up and down the eastern seaboard, sought to turn the politicization of the ballroom to their advantage; spectacular fetes such as Howe's Mischianza won local populations to the British cause, while the Philadelphia Assembly prohibited Loyalists from subscribing to its events. Partially in response to British extravagance, the Continental Army characterized its festivities as orderly, economical, and virtuous. In the Federal era, political rivals again used dance as a form of propaganda, warring over the legacy of independence. International tensions ran high as France found itself embroiled in a bloody revolution that sent a new wave of emigres fleeing abroad. Many settled in the United States and often made a living teaching dance. Pro- and anti-French feeling spilled over into the ballroom. As the rise of the middle class rendered dance an understandable language across a wide swath of the voting population, two major themes arose: that of dance as a wholesome rustic activity in keeping with lauded classical virtues, and that of the social-leveling, chaotic frolic, imbibed with vice and dangerous Jacobin principles. An analysis of dance metaphors reveals growing discomfort with race relations and with the political aspirations of the lower classes, suggesting the gradual closure of the window of opportunity that independence had proffered. English country dance persisted into Jacksonian America, despite the rise of French cotillions and quadrilles. Though it was a tool of reconciliation after the War of 1812, the longways set’s association with egalitarianism made it a target for anti-Jackson feeling by the 1820s. Changing styles in dance and politics also undercut the role of the ballroom. Women assumed a more public role in rallies and social movements, and small-set and partner dances allowed dancers to self-segregate, hindering large-scale communication on the dance floor.",1846141172,,Dissertations & Theses," Stallings, Amy CatherineStallingsCatherineAmyStallings, Amy Catherine",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4270803341 , 109477022 , 66569 , 9781369225211 , 10168232 , 10168232", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369225211, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1846141172?accountid=14496," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0578 History"," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0578 History"," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0578 History",," 0335 European history , 0337 American history , 0578 History"," European history , American history , History"," Social sciences , America , Dance , Politics",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Cabinet+of+Monkies%3A+Dancing+Politics+in+Anglo+Culture%2C+from+Jacobite+to+Jacobin+and+Royalist+to+Republican&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Stallings%2C+Amy+Catherine&amp;isbn=9781369225211&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Revitalizing secondary cities for livability through participatory planning in community building in South Korea,"In South Korea livability concerns have become an increasing focus of public interest as a means to elevate the quality of people's everyday lives in the city. However the social issue of livability has been overlooked while the central government remains focused on neoliberal economic policies, and limiting the participation of civil society in the planning. The gap between livability aims and their relevance in the public conscience is increasing as greater attention is given to the global economic crisis, and the stagnation (or downturn) of local economies, particularly within secondary cities in South Korea. Without emphasis on local culture specific to each region, cities are beginning to look similar and populations are becoming increasingly disconnected from their unique historical and cultural identities. This paper addresses the way in which community building efforts, through participatory planning, can make secondary cities livable. Through the review of case studies of Mauˇl Manduˇlgi movements, this study will explore which occurrences fit the livable city framework, how the movement influenced local governance, to include positive relationships between people and their government, and how positive social and physical changes were made by enhancing conviviality in the community. After identifying the conditions of cities that were successful in community building, this study will present how local cities were able to revitalize themselves through the livable city in the lifeworlds frame. A qualitative research method has been selected for this research, and was conducted with archived documents written by community members, and also by outside members in order to maintain an objective perspective. In this research the cultural framework of the livable city is addressed, and successful cases, and policies, in South Korean society introduced. This research analyzes the following four cases, the Soˇngmisan network in Seoul; Samdoˇk-dong in Daegu; Hanggung-dong (Mauˇl Renaissance) in Suwon; and Munhwa-dong (Si-hwa Munhwa Mauˇl) in Gwangju where living spaces were improved by residents well before the central government adopted Mauˇl Manduˇlgi as a government policy in 2000, and established themselves as potential models of livable communities. These cases elucidate the key components of a livable city in South Korea, and makes a strong argument for the adoption of key policies in secondary cities, to improve their communities through Mauˇl Manduˇlgi ; participatory community building.",1847986891,,Dissertations & Theses," Kang, Min JungKangJungMinKang, Min Jung",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4275952481 , 109516562 , 66569 , 9781369423303 , 10300291 , 10300291", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369423303, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1847986891?accountid=14496, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning, 0999 Urban planning,, 0999 Urban planning, Urban planning," Social sciences , Community building , Livable city , Maul Mandulgi , Participatory planning , Revitalization , Secondary city , South Korea",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Revitalizing+secondary+cities+for+livability+through+participatory+planning+in+community+building+in+South+Korea&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kang%2C+Min+Jung&amp;isbn=9781369423303&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Credible relations: Indian finance and East African society in the Indian Ocean, c. 1860-1940","This dissertation examines the complexities and transformations of the social relations of credit in the connected spaces of coastal East Africa and western India. Credit had facilitated the movement of commodities and enslaved and free people across the Indian Ocean for centuries. Drawing on a wide-range of Gujarati, Arabic, Kiswahili and English sources, this dissertation illuminates how a variety of commercial actors—traders from western India, but also enslaved and manumitted Africans and wives and widows—adapted the instruments that had developed through this long history to participate in the changing and expanding regional economy of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. This dissertation assesses in particular the impact of British expansion on regional socio-economic relations. It argues that imperial interventions into Indian involvement in the East African slave trade were structured by their misrecognition of the social embeddedness of slavery and credit and thus had unforeseen consequences in coastal East Africa and western India. The resulting disruptions in Indian Ocean socio-axiological spaces provided new opportunities for an emerging class of emancipated, manumitted, and non-elite urban debtors looking to loosen their ties with their former master-patrons. The sophisticated financial forms and institutions that emerged in this period were not imported by a static and bounded community of Indian ‘merchant middlemen’, but rather, this dissertation argues, produced by the changing needs and desires of members of a dynamic coastal society. The mutually beneficial, though still unequal, social ties between professionalized money-lenders and non-elite debtors that emerged in this period, moreover, proved resilient against colonial policy that aimed to solve the ‘problem’ of indebtedness from the early twentieth century. Indeed, it would take a global crisis of indebtedness in the 1930s to shake the foundations of these long-standing and adaptable credit relations. This dissertation shows how the debates about debt and development in this period simultaneously prompted Indians, as well as other East African actors, to articulate their relationship with ‘home’, empire, and each other in new ways. However, these new political imaginations also grew out of the socio-economic transformations of the earlier decades; the upheavals in commercial life in the late nineteenth century combined with the uneven extension of Anglo-Indian customary law to foreground the vulnerability of those household members ‘left behind’ in India and produced increasingly restrictive definitions of family and community among Indians around the Indian Ocean. Thus, this dissertation illuminates a previously ignored connection between transformations in financial obligations in late nineteenth century East Africa and shifting forms of familial obligation in the subcontinent and abroad. In so doing, this dissertation reconceptualizes the position of the family and household in regional trading networks. More broadly, this dissertation shows how regional and capitalist financial forms were significantly structured by the trans-local and intimate interactions between a wide range of Indian Ocean actors.",1848667471,,Dissertations & Theses," Wint, HollianWintHollianWint, Hollian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4277733791 , 103749692 , 66569 , 9781369332728 , 10192346 , 10192346", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369332728, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1848667471?accountid=14496," 0331 African history , 0509 Economic history , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0331 African history , 0509 Economic history , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0331 African history , 0509 Economic history , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0331 African history , 0509 Economic history , 0638 South Asian Studies"," African history , Economic history , South Asian Studies"," Social sciences , Credit , Debt , East Africa , Family , Indian Ocean , Slavery and abolition , Trade",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Credible+relations%3A+Indian+finance+and+East+African+society+in+the+Indian+Ocean%2C+c.+1860-1940&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Wint%2C+Hollian&amp;isbn=9781369332728&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Biological motion perception: Action interaction and prediction,"Humans, as social creatures, are especially adept in perceiving others’ actions and inferring mental states such as intention based on non-verbal cues such as body movements. In recent years, substantial advances have been achieved in our understanding of biological motion perception and its relation to other cognitive and motorsensory processes, as well as the underlying neural correlates and computational components. In my thesis, I first focused on the top-down influence of meaningful interactive actions on stimulus visibility. We found that meaningful interaction boosted the visibility of single actor in binocular rivalry paradigm. Second, I investigated the action prediction modulated by action interaction (i.e. either single actor or two interactive actors) with temporal occluder paradigm. We found that observers obtained higher temporal precision in single actor condition but better sensitivity to posture sequence or rotation in two interactive actor condition. Third, we designed novel paradigm by briefly flashing joints near the moving limb to determine how action representation interacts with generic mechanisms for localization of moving features to bias perceived positions of moving joints. We found that global posture information (inversion or upside-down) modulated the effect size of well-established visual illusion (i.e. flash lag effect). Last but not least, I used this paradigm to dissociate local and global mechanisms that may underlie action prediction. By briefly flashing the stationary skeleton during the action viewing, either aligned or misaligned with the walking posture, we measured the motion-induced posture change. We demonstrated the existence of a global mechanism for anticipating changes in whole-body posture over time. However, although inversion of body orientation weakens global processing in biological motion perception, it does not eliminate the use of the global mechanism in predicting future posture even when the action is presented upside-down. This finding is consistent with previous studies of the inversion effect in biological motion perception (Pavlova &amp; Sokolov, 2000; Sumi, 1984), and highlights the robust use of the global mechanism in predicting future actions.",1849032013,,Dissertations & Theses," Su, JunzhuSuJunzhuSu, Junzhu",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4279220561 , 109641152 , 66569 , 9781369299922 , 10181393 , 10181393", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369299922, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1849032013?accountid=14496, 0349 Psychobiology, 0349 Psychobiology, 0349 Psychobiology,, 0349 Psychobiology, Psychobiology," Psychology , Aciton interaction , Action prediction , Biological motion",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Biological+motion+perception%3A+Action+interaction+and+prediction&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Su%2C+Junzhu&amp;isbn=9781369299922&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Otherness and belonging in ""democratic empires"": The Syrian diaspora and transatlantic discourses of identity, 1890s-1930s","This dissertation examines the arguments that Syrians in diaspora at the turn of the twentieth century used in constructing their group identity. It traces the transnational and transimperial discourses that centered on the pack-peddler mythology, or rather, it traces the diaspora intelligentsia’s narrative for the business diaspora. Their narrative framed the business elites as the quintessence of upward mobility in the modern world. The historiography of this subfield has been separated into two camps: one that takes for granted the assimilation of the business class into Western societies, and the other that offers a more critical rendering of Syrian migrant entrepreneurship. This dissertation bridges the gap between the two by offering a cultural study of the meaning of wealth and mobility. This study takes into account a broad array of analytical lenses through which to view the Syrian diaspora: migration studies, business history, the history of science and technology, medicine, disability studies, race and whiteness studies, while maintaining a critical eye toward cultural symbolism and meaning across time and space. It takes into account how the transnational movement of peoples, goods, and ideas, clashed with the emergence of nations-states and the continually shifting national identities underpinning them. The elites of the Syrian migrant community maintained vigilance in self-portrayal as they crisscrossed national borders and confronted agents of state institutions. They formulated various proto-national identities for the entire diasporic community that centered on the agenda of the intelligentsia, and fitted other members of the diaspora into that mold. In the process, Syrian migrants would play different imperial powers and nation-states against one another to maintain their group’s social status and business connections. Moreover, they simultaneously committed to redefining the boundaries of the region that increasingly became to be seen as the “Middle East”. By adopting modes of modern capitalism, rendering free-trade practices as intrinsically Syrian, and then exporting those practices to the imperial periphery in areas that included Madeira and the Philippines, Syrians attempted to “assimilate” to modernity. Syrian migrants, however, became enmeshed in a state of in-betweenness both in their adopted receiving societies and in their sending societies in the Eastern Mediterranean.",1858890240,,Dissertations & Theses," Garrett, Bryan A.GarrettA.BryanGarrett, Bryan A.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4297452361 , 110082732 , 66569 , 9781369470611 , 10302024 , 10302024", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369470611, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1858890240?accountid=14496," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history",," 0333 Middle Eastern history , 0337 American history , 0582 Modern history"," Middle Eastern history , American history , Modern history"," Social sciences , Business , Civilization , Disability , Identity , Medicine , Migration , Race , Syria , Syrian , Transnational",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Otherness+and+belonging+in+%22democratic+empires%22%3A+The+Syrian+diaspora+and+transatlantic+discourses+of+identity%2C+1890s-1930s&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Garrett%2C+Bryan+A.&amp;isbn=9781369470611&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Exploration of socioeconomic and spatial attributes affecting freight trip production,"Demands for goods are expanding with increasingly global markets and growing economies, contributing to increased goods movement, congestion, and pollution. This research uses modeling techniques to explore the underlying causes that influence Freight Trip Production (FTP). FTP is the term given to truck trips originating from a business establishment. The effects of socio-economic, land value, spatial, and geographic attributes on FTP are explored. The study is based on survey data with total of 221 responses providing information about the establishment and their typical freight trip productions from New York City and the New York Capital District Region. Each response was geo-spatially located and information related to its location was ascertained, including social and economic data collected by the US Census. Implementing spatial econometric techniques to test for spatial autocorrelation, the connection between establishment attributes, location and the number of freight trips they produce is modeled.

The Bush and Obama administrations have fought a mostly military-centric campaign against radical Islamist groups across the world that the U.S. State Department labels as Foreign Terrorist Organizations. However, according to Dr. Mark Juergensmeyer in his award-winning book, Terror in the Mind of God: The Global Rise of Religious Violence, religion alone does not ordinarily lead to violence. When religion becomes fused with political, social, and ideological circumstances, violence can manifest due to social aspirations, personal pride, and movements for political change. Therefore, the War on Terror is highly complex with multiple, intersecting variables contributing to the increased intractability over time. These violent groups are best labeled as politically motivated insurgencies using terrorist tactics. Terrorism is used to elicit a psychological response and destabilize a population, while an insurgency is the organized use of subversion and violence to seize, nullify, or challenge political control of a region. The U.S. continues to label these groups as terrorist organizations, leading to an overdependence on the use of airstrikes to confront these violent groups. Remotely operated (drones) and manned (bombers) weapon systems have come to drive policy against religiously motivated terrorist organizations as the U.S. population and the Obama administration become increasingly reticent to deploy combat troops. However, without the security of combat troops, there is a minimal and ineffective presence of the other organs of the U.S. government to address the political, social, and ideological underpinnings that fuel these violent groups. The issue of violent extremism is an intractable problem requiring a complex set of solutions. By not understanding and acknowledging that extremist organizations are fundamentally local and thrive in ungoverned spaces, the U.S.’s use of airstrikes will further radicalize the population and raise the salience of radical religious ideology. This thesis will test this hypothesis by conducting an analysis of U.S. efforts to counter the Pakistani Taliban and the Islamic State through mostly military means. Specifically, it will assess how this approach does not address the lack of effective and inclusive governance in Pakistan and Iraq that allows the aforementioned violent groups to function and flourish. As the number and scope of radical, violent extremist organizations continue to grow, it is vital the U.S. create a policy for countering violent extremism that deals with the complexity of the conflict, seeks long-term stability, and utilizes all available means.",1864681071,,Dissertations & Theses," Kohistany, M.

This thesis aims to address this gap by examining three sites and processes of non-mainstream screen distribution and exhibition: a non-profit film distributor in Hong Kong, a diasporic film festival in Toronto, and a non-collecting gallery in Vancouver. Using a scavenger methodology and through empirical research, the thesis reveals how these sites have responded proactively to opportunities and threats posed by deregulation, privatization, and the rise of Asia. Unlike governments or media conglomerates, however, these sites have not been driven by competition and profit-seeking, but by a commitment to social and political transformation. The study highlights the sites’ adoption of a minor transnational strategy—a linking together of peripheral screen cultures and marginal groups to other peripheral screen cultures and marginal groups—as an alternative within globalism and regionalization. It argues that minor transnational practices depend first on “independent sole traders”—educational migrants and cultural workers who broker the movement of media within and across marginal groups—and second, on minor-to-minor distribution and exhibition circuits that are contingent and dispersed. By staging cultural connections and exchanges within and between peripheries, these sites have led to the production of new identities, such as queer Asian, and social imaginaries, such as an “imagined community of indies,” that exceed the logics of the market and the neoliberal nation-state.",1865274012,,Dissertations & Theses," Yeo, Su-AnneYeoSu-AnneYeo, Su-Anne",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4312299671 , 105094832 , 101309 , 10305045 , 10305045 , http://research.gold.ac.uk/18872/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1865274012?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://research.gold.ac.uk/18872/ , (UMI)AAI10305045 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Transnational+screens+and+asia+pacific+public+cultures%3A+vancouver%2C+toronto%2C+and+hong+kong%2C+1997-2007&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Yeo%2C+Su-Anne&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Configuring the qualification of good coffee: An ethnography on the specialty coffee industry in Milwaukee,"I put qualification at the center of this research, because the intensive emphasis on coffee quality in the Third Wave Coffee Movement is the first thing that drew me to this research. When I talked with people in the specialty coffee industry in Milwaukee, they did not always admit they are part of the movement but they did highlight coffee quality as the core value of the specialty coffee market. The concept of qualification comes from Michael Callon and his colleagues’ (2002) theoretical framework “the economy of qualities.” It refers to an economy in which tradable goods in the market are defined by the characteristics attributed to them in successive qualifications and re-qualifications, enacted by producers, marketers, and consumers. This framework helped me to locate my research and initially directed me where to look and to make sense of what I have seen and heard. I asked, What are they actually doing when they provide coffee factory tours, mark coffee flavors, perform a pour over, and meet with producers? Under the framework of “the economy of qualities”, the question became what marketers are doing to all the other relationships they are embedded in through qualifying coffee. Nevertheless, this framework has a major problem. It draws an ahistorical picture of commodification. “The economy of qualities” does not deal with politics, at lease at its macro level. It presents a synchronous picture in which different groups of people and their agencies all enact through and are connected by a certain commodity, so that the historical relationships, especially inequality, among producers, consumers, and marketers are neutralized and ignored. What the framework does is to capture the moment when commodity connects to different groups of people and pay attention to the dynamics or negotiations on the basis of this network. However, the framework does not talk about what happened before the network of multiple qualifications came into being, for example the history of colonization, and the collapses of international regulations in the global market. Meanwhile, the framework does not concern the social or political consequences of such qualifications, so that it ignores the invisible and the silent ones that are left out in this network of qualification. For example, how to make sense of marketers’ practice of qualification as the signs of gentrification in the urban space? How to think of consumption and marketing patterns as consequential sites of class reproduction beyond the (re)qualifications of the commodity? I organized this thesis under the framework of “the economy of qualities,” but at the same time reached to theories and ethnographies that consider how social discourses and practices are inexorably linked to hegemonic social relations. These theories and ethnographies enable me to look at the spatiality of the specialty coffee shops in the context of gentrification and analyze the effectiveness of tastes as a resource for social stratification. Coming back to my title, “good” in the qualification of good coffee can be interpreted from different perspectives. Good could be ethical, doing good or evil, being right or wrong. Good could be a standard, which sets apart those products that failed to meet the standard as not good enough. Good could also be personal. People think the coffee is good because they like it. Intentionally or unintentionally choosing one perspective over the other to define “good” is embedded in a specific socio-economic context and has its consequences. This ethnography is the case study of how the specialty coffee is (re)qualified by the marketers and why it is important to document and analyze it.",1867702931,,Dissertations & Theses," Liu, YangLiuYangLiu, Yang",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4313470011 , 106338062 , 66569 , 9781369477559 , 10250490 , 10250490", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369477559, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1867702931?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Distinction , Materiality , Milwaukee , Neoliberalism , Qualification , Specialty coffee",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Configuring+the+qualification+of+good+coffee%3A+An+ethnography+on+the+specialty+coffee+industry+in+Milwaukee&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Liu%2C+Yang&amp;isbn=9781369477559&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Indian Muslims, other religions and the modern resurgence of &lt;i&gt;Da'wa:&lt;/i&gt; The Tablīghī Jamā'at and Zakir Naik's Islamic Research Foundation","da‘wa is a classical Islamic concept which has been dramatically re-appropriated in modern times across the Muslim world. This dissertation explores the modern resurgence of da‘wa —“inviting” to Islam, or Islamic missionary activity—through the lens of inter-religious relations, and within the two horizons Islamic history and modernity. It demonstrates, first, the close relationship that has existed between da‘wa and inter-religious relations both in the past and in the modern period. Second, it sheds light on the diversity of da‘wa in the midst of other religions by tracing two broad styles of da‘wa throughout Islamic history: “bottom-up” and “top-down” da‘wa . Finally, it argues that Muslim communities in colonial and post-colonial India shed light on these themes with particular clarity. Indian Muslims, this dissertation suggests, have made pioneering contributions to global da‘wa , particularly with respect to their development of bottom-up styles of da‘wa and what this dissertation calls “ da‘wa modernities.” These arguments are developed in two parts. Part I provides an examination of da‘wa in relation to other religions from the Qur’an to the modern period. Since few studies have examined Islamic history through these lenses, this represents a major contribution in its own right. Building on Part I, Part II analyzes two prominent Sunni da‘wa organizations to emerge from the Indian subcontinent in the past century: the Tablīghī Jamā‘at (TJ) and the Islamic Research Foundation of Dr. Zakir Naik (IRF). By investigating and juxtaposing the lineages, formative histories and inter-religious discourses of these movements and their founders, Part II elucidates both the unique contributions Indian Muslims have made to modern da‘wa , and the diversity of Indian da‘wa. In response to the political, social and inter-religious challenges they have faced in modern India, and through their fresh engagement with Islamic scripture and tradition, these movements have developed related, though distinct, bottom-up styles of da‘wa and da‘wa modernities which have proven to be globally relevant. This dissertation thus makes a significant contribution to the study of da‘wa in general and to the study of the Tablīghī Jamā‘at. It also provides the first major scholarly study of Zakir Naik.",1872294456,,Dissertations & Theses," Kuiper, Matthew J.KuiperJ.MatthewKuiper, Matthew J.",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4317317411 , 111224382 , 66569 , 9781369541441 , 10308159 , 10308159", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369541441, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1872294456?accountid=14496," 0320 Religious history , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," 0320 Religious history , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies",," 0320 Religious history , 0512 Islamic Studies , 0638 South Asian Studies"," Religious history , Islamic Studies , South Asian Studies"," Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Da'wa , Hadith , India , Islam , Naik, Zakir , Qur'an , Tablighi Jama'at",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Indian+Muslims%2C+other+religions+and+the+modern+resurgence+of+Da%27wa%3A+The+Tabl%C4%ABgh%C4%AB+Jam%C4%81%27at+and+Zakir+Naik%27s+Islamic+Research+Foundation&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Kuiper%2C+Matthew+J.&amp;isbn=9781369541441&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Authoritarian response to popular revolutions: An analysis of the paranoid personality in leadership decision-making,"The unforeseen mass protests in Tunisia that overthrew Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali and quickly spread to Egypt where Muhammad Hosni Sayyid Mubarak was forced from office highlight that a psychological aspect needs to be added to how revolutions are studied. Although the various countries directly affected by what is now known as the Arab Spring share similar sociopolitical, cultural, and economic backgrounds, the different fates of Ben Ali and Mubarak being forced from power while authoritarians such as Bashar Hafez al-Assad have remained show that these similarities do not necessarily dictate how an authoritarian will behave when facing similar popularly-backed threats. The literature on revolutionary social movements provides insight into what conditions such revolutionary movements need to succeed, in terms of organization and resources, as well on how international relations of closed political systems can aid or hinder the survival of such systems when faced with existential crisis. However, a psychological perspective on why an authoritarian may relinquish power when challenged has been largely missed in this literature. This dissertation then, seeks to address this gap of how a leader’s personality may affect decisions to flee, or fight on, when faced with tremendous pressure to step down. By analyzing the case study of Egypt’s Mubarak, this dissertation finds that a leader’s personality, as shaped by the environment, affects decision-making and may impede an authoritarian with a paranoid personality disorder from returning to a psychologically harmonious balance, once disrupted, that would allow him to regain control of his environment and thereby fight to keep his political power. In the case of Mubarak, such a paranoid mental state influenced his decision to ultimately step down after approximately 30 years in power.",1872585552,,Dissertations & Theses," Ramirez, DamianRamirezDamianRamirez, Damian",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4317506851 , 106519132 , 66569 , 9781369618198 , 10190502 , 10190502", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369618198, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1872585552?accountid=14496," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0621 Psychology"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0621 Psychology"," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0621 Psychology",," 0601 International Relations , 0615 Political science , 0621 Psychology"," International Relations , Political science , Psychology"," Social sciences , Psychology , International relations , Mubarak, Hosni Sayyid , Paranoid personality , Political psychology",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Authoritarian+response+to+popular+revolutions%3A+An+analysis+of+the+paranoid+personality+in+leadership+decision-making&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Ramirez%2C+Damian&amp;isbn=9781369618198&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Beautiful Lives: Priests, Beauticians, and Performance of Islamic Piety in a Non-Gendered Economy in South Sulawesi, Indonesia","The dissertation unravels how the indigenous transgender identity of the bissu experiences reconfigurations within the Indonesian modern culture dominated by Islamic heterosexual norm. Based on the data collected from the field research in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, archival research in the Netherlands, and media research, the dissertation traces the inflections of bissu identity at the intersection between local traditions and the emergent modern spectator community, artistic experimentation, global culture industry, and homosexual movement in the aftermath of Suharto’s fall in 1998. Within this multicultural network, the indigenous identity of the bissu constitutes a paradox in which the convergence between the bissu traditional practices and modern artistic practices transcends the bissu ’s distinct transgender position from its local reality and engenders a discursive and social space that allows the bissu to overcome the constraint of Islamic heterosexual norm and to provide a cultural and historical register for the urban transgender groups to claim their local cultural root. The location of the bissu indigeneity and transgender identity lies within the dynamic interactions among the bissu , the state, and culture industry, in which moral sentiments and aesthetic sensibility emerge in their distinct forms. The research poses a critique against the failure of the mainstream narratives to address the emerging moral space the bissu inhabit. The space, which I call a spiritual aesthetic space, contains disparate religious and cultural elements as the bissu unite three strands of identity: transgender, Islamic, and indigenous.",1873487039,,Dissertations & Theses," Umar, UmarUmarUmarUmar, Umar",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4317951811 , 107504832 , 66569 , 9781369559330 , 10192769 , 10192769", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369559330, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873487039?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0604 Regional Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0604 Regional Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0604 Regional Studies , 0733 Gender studies",," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0492 GLBT Studies , 0604 Regional Studies , 0733 Gender studies"," Cultural anthropology , GLBT Studies , Regional Studies , Gender studies"," Social sciences , Adat , Bissu , Islam , Performance , Sulawesi , Transgender",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Beautiful+Lives%3A+Priests%2C+Beauticians%2C+and+Performance+of+Islamic%0APiety+in+a+Non-Gendered+Economy+in+South+Sulawesi%2C+Indonesia&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Umar%2C+Umar&amp;isbn=9781369559330&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Becoming Political Subjects in the City's Peripheries: &lt;i&gt; Pobladores&lt;/i&gt; and Housing Struggles in Santiago, Chile","Social scientists and urban planners have long argued that social movements for housing, especially in metropolises of the so-called Global South, have been determinant in the politicization of the urban poor. Since the mid-twentieth century, the demand for rights to physical presence in the city has resulted in large-scale right-to-housing mobilizations in which lower-income dwellers seek to become homeowners by taking over peripheral empty plots and building themselves their homes and neighborhoods (e.g. Mangin 1967; Turner 1968; Castells 1983; Holston 1991; 2008; Garcés 2002; Fawaz 2009; Das 2011; Caldeira 2015a; Murphy 2015). Scholars have thus suggested that the urban poor, on account of their involvement in widespread practices of city making carried out mostly in the urban peripheries, have become citizens capable of addressing a language of rights to the state. This dissertation engages in these debates by posing some critical questions: What are the mechanisms through which the urban poor constitute themselves as legitimate rights-bearers when they are no longer the actual builders of their residential spaces? What kind of political subjectivity is formed when their demand for urban rights is performed less through mass land seizures and “autoconstruction” processes (Holston 1991; 2008; Caldeira 2000; 2015a) than through their participation in state-regulated housing assemblies? This dissertation examines the rise and development of housing movements in Santiago, Chile based on archival analysis of past urban mobilizations and ethnographic observation of contemporary housing assemblies. This study scrutinizes thus the ways in which working-class dwellers articulate a rights-based political language and produce new political subjectivities while enrolled in housing programs through which they apply for state subsidies. Since the 1950s, housing struggles in Chile have been grounded in a kind of social agency known as pobladores (urban poor). In the 1960s and early 1970s, pobladores made use of two interrelated performances of city making to become homeowners: illegal land occupations and autoconstruction. This gave rise to mass social protests known as “ pobladores movement” (Castells 1973; 1983; Pastrana and Threlfall 1974; Espinoza 1988; Garcés 2002; Cortés 2014). However, the arrival of Augusto Pinochet’s military dictatorship (1973–1990) drastically repressed these mobilizations. Likewise, it implemented a neoliberal, subsidy-based housing policy, which changed significantly the way pobladores obtain and envisage social housing. Accordingly, since the late 1970s state policies conceive housing less as the result of collective practices of city making than as a commodity that the poor can obtain through both state subsidies and private savings (Bruey 2012; Özler 2012). Over the past twenty-five years, post-dictatorial governments have tried to avoid the reappearance of urban movements by pre-emptively building subsidized housing projects. During the 1990s, the state endeavored to construct at least 90,000 subsidized housing units per year (Arriagada and Moreno 2006). This eventually helped reduce the housing shortage from 918,756 units in 1990 to 743,450 in 2000, which represents a decrease from 53% to 37% in the number of households in need of housing. This reduction of the housing deficit persisted in the following decades reaching 459,347 units in 2013 (Ministerio de Desarrollo Social 2014a). In that context, by 2000 large-scale land occupations almost totally disappeared, calling into question the very existence of pobladores as subjects endowed with a capacity to intervene in the political sphere. However, while the government has massively delivered housing, these subsidized homes are often located in peripheral areas lacking infrastructure and services. This fact has triggered an emerging process of remobilization in the last ten years in which the new generations of pobladores are increasingly claiming the right to “dignified housing” ( vivienda digna ) and a “dignified life” ( vida digna ). Interestingly, the tactics of these new protests consist less of land occupations than of pobladores ’ enrollment in housing programs through which they expect to obtain subsidized housing. My dissertation, in this regard, discusses the mechanisms through which contemporary pobladores recreate their political agencies when they no longer organize their protests as squatters nor autoconstructors, but rather as “formal” dwellers enrolled in subsidy-based programs. I conclude that the Chilean urban poor, by identifying themselves as pobladores , form themselves as political agents capable of dealing with the state on the basis of a rights-based language. To do so, they bring the performative power of the word poblador into the present by executing a territorially situated political practices through which they evoke the pobladores movement of the mid-twentieth century. This work examines thus how the past informs the mobilizations of the present and how lower-income residents becomes pobladores even when the performances of city making that characterized past urban movements are recalled rather than actually performed. Likewise, this dissertation discusses to what extent such a subject-formation process makes possible the emergence of new kinds of citizenship in which pobladores , by conceiving of themselves as city-makers, legitimize their claims to have dignified housing and a dignified life.",1873865779,,Dissertations & Theses," Perez Ahumada, MiguelPerez AhumadaMiguelPerez Ahumada, Miguel",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4318321721 , 107504832 , 66569 , 9781369558470 , 10191359 , 10191359", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369558470, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1873865779?accountid=14496, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology, 0326 Cultural anthropology,, 0326 Cultural anthropology, Cultural anthropology," Social sciences , Agency , Citizenship , Housing , Santiago de Chile , Social movements , Subjectivity",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Becoming+Political+Subjects+in+the+City%27s+Peripheries%3A+%0APobladores+and+Housing+Struggles+in+Santiago%2C+Chile&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Perez+Ahumada%2C+Miguel&amp;isbn=9781369558470&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"Dissertations & Theses @ University of California,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The advocacy activities of the japanese rescue movement (1997-2006): to what extent did they impact japanese foreign policy toward north korea?,"Japanese foreign policy toward North Korea shifted over a relatively short period of time between 1998 and 2006. North Korea conducted missile tests close to Japan in 1998 and in 2006 but Japan`s reaction was different in each situation. In 1998, although the missile launch was considered regrettable from the viewpoint of security, and peace and stability of the region, the Japanese government did not impose long-term sanctions, nor respond with coercive accusations. However, in 2006, after an event similar to the one in 1998, Japan imposed unilateral sanctions on North Korea, therefore punishing a neighbouring state, for the first time since World War II. This thesis offers an explanation for this shift in the Japanese government`s policy toward North Korea focusing on civil society groups, and in particular on the Japanese Rescue Movement and the way in which the comprising groups advocated their cause to various audiences: government, public, media, and other state or non-state actors. Based on the findings of the research, the thesis argues that the Japanese Rescue Movement had an instrumental role in shaping the government's policy toward North Korea in 2006 to impose unilateral economic sanctions. Alongside the instrumentalization of the abduction issue and of Kazokukai by Sukuukai and Satō Katsumi, the Head of Modern Korea Research Institute and Chairman of Sukuukai, young, conservative politicians, who came to hold positions of power in the 2000s, used the Rescue Movement and its advocated goal as an instrument in the policy toward North Korea, in order to promote a certain political agenda. Moreover, the thesis highlights the strategies and tactics of the civil society groups towards various audiences, drawing on the concept of ""advocacy"" with its four types: political, social, media and transnational. Finally, the dissertation underlines the circumstances in which civil society can successfully contribute to policy-making in Japan.",1874894132,,Dissertations & Theses," Iancu, OanaIancuOanaIancu, Oana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4319296691 , 103854262 , 101309 , 10584808 , 10584808 , http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/15197/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1874894132?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/15197/ , (UMI)AAI10584808 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+advocacy+activities+of+the+japanese+rescue+movement+%281997-2006%29%3A+to+what+extent+did+they+impact+japanese+foreign+policy+toward+north+korea%3F&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Iancu%2C+Oana&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Algorithmic Detectives Against Child Trafficking: &lt;i&gt; Data, Entrapment, and the New Global Policing Network&lt;/i&gt;","My dissertation explores how ""anti-trafficking"" has emerged as a global network of humanitarian professionals, law enforcement, and software companies collaborating to address the issue of child exploitation and trafficking online. I argue that the anti-trafficking network consolidates expertise through a shared moralizing politics of bureaucracy and carceral sensibility of securitization. This network mobilizes the issue of child protection to expand the reach of technologies of search and prediction, and to afford legitimation to a newly normalized level of digital surveillance. My findings are based on three years of ethnographic fieldwork and interviews with the United Nations and anti-trafficking organizations in Thailand, with a child protection NGO and police in the Netherlands, and with software companies and law enforcement in the United States. I use two case studies to support my argument that the child protection movement has motivated the expansion of digital policing and surveillance: 1) image detection software developed in collaboration between social media and software companies and international law enforcement organizations; and 2) the design and deployment of a 3D moving avatar of a photorealistic girl used in a child sex exploitation sting operation by an NGO working with an advertising firm. I draw from queer feminist phenomenology to introduce 'proximity' as a governing concept for understanding expert sociality and digital surveillance. Child protection operates in a global affective economy of fear, in which the risk of violence is always anticipated and close. The new global policing network keeps exploitation proximate through the humanitarian ideology of emancipation that motivates child protection, and through publicity of technological campaigns, in order to produce public acquiescence to the spectades of digital surveillance, shaming, and punishment.

On one side, supporters have pushed for the construction of the dam in order to meet growing demand for energy in Brazil. One the other side, opponents have cited negative social and environmental impacts in order to press the government to cancel the dam. Over many years, this conflict has been waged in several spaces, including on the streets of several cities, in the courts, and inside governmental offices. Recently, the Belo Monte conflict gained an online component as supporters and opponents began to use digital technologies to defend their perspectives. In this dissertation, I examine the role of digital technologies in the conflict over Belo Monte, and recent changes in the social movement opposing the dam. My analysis proceeds in three main parts. First, I explain how the Belo Monte conflict gained a strong online component and highlight the significance of online contestation, such as via the spillover effects from cyberspace to the mainstream media. This part of the analysis offers an account of how online contestation can emerge, as well as how it can spill over into other media and broader publics. Second, I compare how supporters and opponents of Belo Monte used online technologies to advance their perspectives. This offers a relatively rare appraisal of how activists as well as defenders of the status quo use digital technologies, and permits an evaluation of whether activists gain an advantage by protesting online. Third, I provide an explanation as to why Belo Monte was approved despite the strong opposition, both online and offline. Whereas other accounts highlight national and international factors tied to the political economy of Brazil, I call attention to local factors that reveal ruptures in the grassroots movement itself, which also merit recognition in explanation. With this analysis, I argue that conceptualizing the Internet as a space for conflict is useful in order to examine the use of online technologies in conflicts, particularly if one wants to account for movement/countermovement dynamics online.",1878887954,,Dissertations & Theses," Leite, Flavia LanaLeiteLanaFlaviaLeite, Flavia Lana",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4320991943 , 111360552 , 66569 , 9781369598391 , 10409079 , 10409079", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369598391, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1878887954?accountid=14496, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology, 0626 Sociology,, 0626 Sociology, Sociology," Social sciences , Brazil , Hydroelectric DAMS , Internet , Protest , Social media , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Online+conflicts+over+conservation+and+development+of+the+Amazon%3A+The+case+of+the+conflict+over+the+construction+of+the+Belo+Monte+hydroelectric+dam+in+Brazil&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Leite%2C+Flavia+Lana&amp;isbn=9781369598391&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""Shanti Mandir: Authenticity, economy and emotion in a yoga ashram","The sociological question of what holds groups together fascinates me. The ‘glue’ of solidarity is considered to be affective emotional experiences experienced during the performance of collective enterprises. The reciprocity of emotion and subsequent exchanges of capital are found at the centre of the guru-disciple relationship. The focus of this relationship is the transference of grace (śaktipāta) from the guru to the disciple. Therefore, in order to understand how a legitimate yogic identity is constructed, contested and expressed this thesis focuses on exploring the various exchanges, reasons and ways that people join the Shanti Mandir (Temple of Peace) global community of yoga aspirants. This is done to understand the structural, cognitive and emotional aspects inherent in the micro-translation of macro sociological processes related to the construction of authenticity and accumulation of legitimacy. The primary good of salvation produced by Shanti Mandir and consumed by the disciples is the opportunity to emulate the ideal knower’s disposition (i.e. the guru). I identify the guru’s disposition as that of an ‘embodier of tranquility’ (śāntamurti). This opportunity to emulate is a result of repeated positive interactions that produce emotional solidarity through the transference of affect that occurs formally at the ritual level and informally at the social level. Formally, this occurs during the twice-daily ritualised performance of satsaṅga (confluence of truth) where the palpable aesthetic mood of śānta (tranquility) is temporarily cultivated and legitimised as an expression of the ‘divinity that dwells within’. Individuals also gain respite from their anxiety and doubt through a collective sense of community, purpose and shared identity. This is achieved by participating in the daily religious practice, which focuses on the devotional aspects of the guru-bhakti tradition and functions primarily through non-market (emotional) labour in the form of gurusevā (volunteer service to the guru). Individuals engage in this system in order to experience a ‘Vedic way of life’ through a syncretic form of neo-Hinduism. The principal goal of which involves possibly attaining liberation in this lifetime (jīvanmukta). The three groups that comprise the disciples: Renunciants, Scholars and Patrons work together investing various species of capital (social, cultural and economic respectively) to support the guru’s saṅkalpa (intention), which is centred around promoting a ‘Vedic tradition’ and ‘guiding seekers to the direct experience of divinity’. While the guru’s intention is quite often misrecognised as a disinterested promotion of divinity and a palpable experience of tranquility, when contextualised by the transglobal yoga and spiritual tourism industries these exchanges of capital take on new meanings. The aim of this research is to understand the symbolic struggles for recognition that occur at both individual and organisational levels regarding what represents an ‘authentic’ yogic identity within this community. By identifying Shanti Mandir as a new religious movement and non-profit business within these multi-billion dollar industries, combined with analysing the guru’s discourse and the organisation’s marketing strategies this thesis highlights how legitimate participation is characterised, how access and ascension through the social network is achieved, and how the market forces of globalisation and subsequent transcultural flows of knowledge continue to shape and reproduce legitimacy and authenticity within this yogically-inspired community.",1883339805,,Dissertations & Theses," McCartney, PatrickMcCartneyPatrickMcCartney, Patrick",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321390055 , 111424102 , 189128 , 10587442 , 10587442 , https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/101727", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - Global,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1883339805?accountid=14496," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0647 Spirituality"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0647 Spirituality"," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0647 Spirituality", Australian National University," 0326 Cultural anthropology , 0647 Spirituality"," Cultural anthropology , Spirituality"," https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/101727 , (UMI)AAI10587442 , Philosophy, religion and theology , Social sciences , Yoga",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Shanti+Mandir%3A+Authenticity%2C+economy+and+emotion+in+a+yoga+ashram&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=McCartney%2C+Patrick&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""The Papua Separatist Group and Indonesia in the Age of New Public Diplomacy: A Comparative Analysis of Websites, Facebook Visuals, and Twitter","The rise of digital media in the 21st century caused changes in the society, as networked digital communication decentralized public communication. The presence of Internet and other forms of digital media potentially affected the Free West Papua Movement, one of the oldest minority resistance groups in Indonesia. However, this concern is still unnoticed in the studies regarding the Papua separatist group. Dominated by political and cultural studies, the body of knowledge of the Papua separatists still lacks a communication studies’ perspective. Hence, the author argues that communication studies are useful to analyze recent issues of the Papua separatist group, particularly in the age of digital media. There were three main aspects analyzed in this dissertation by three different but related studies. Study one addressed how the Free West Papua Movement compared to other separatist groups. Drawing from separatism studies and non-profit marketing literature, study one analyzed the marketing taxonomy of the political separatist groups, the ethnic separatist groups, and the terrorist separatist groups. The author employed comparative analysis to examine a total census of 54 separatist groups’ websites. Study one particularly analyzed their marketing activities, i.e. funding resources, media channels, and recruitment strategies. The results showed each separatist group category had different characteristics regarding their marketing activities. Some important findings included the political separatist groups exclusively accessed the government funding, the ethnic separatist groups aimed their media channels to get support from the international audience, and the terrorist separatist groups are more likely to employ a closed (internal) recruitment. Study two addressed the issue of the Papua separatist group’s identity representation in the social media. Since 2009, the Papua separatist group actively posted messages on its Facebook account, particularly in the form of photos. Having more than 200,000 followers, the separatists’ had image representation that became an important issue to discuss in this paper. With social media allowing minorities to present their own images, the public’s perception towards the separatists might change from the traditional media’s perspectives. Many scholars in political and visual communication also shared this view. However, none of them ever analyzed the Papua separatist group identity representation. Using mixed methods visual content analysis, study two analyzed more than 1,200 photos and captions. The results found four themes representing the Papua separatists’ photos, i.e. independence, local tradition, oppression, and solidarity. Further, the findings showed that the Papua separatist group employed races, flags, locations, backgrounds, etc. as its photos’ signs. The findings also supported study one’s conclusion regarding the ethnic separatist groups aiming at international support rather than local support. Next, study three examined how the Indonesian Government responded to the recent Papua issues in the social media. Drawing from public diplomacy studies, the author analyzed the content of the Indonesian Government’s Twitter messages (tweets). A total of 174 tweets were analyzed. The results showed that the Indonesian Government employed more soft power messages than hard power messages when addressing recent Papua issues. In addition, the findings showed that the Indonesian Government used combinations of traditional and new public diplomacy elements. The findings from the three studies revealed new perspectives regarding the case of the Papua separatist group in the age of digital media. In addition, the three studies also contribute to content analysis as a research method. Nevertheless, the author encourages further studies, particularly studies that employ different research method designs. For example, survey and audience studies will reveal more social scientific findings regarding the case of the Papua separatist group in the age of digital media.",1884185961,,Dissertations & Theses," Widinugraha, DwiyatnaWidinugrahaDwiyatnaWidinugraha, Dwiyatna",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321443659 , 111373362 , 66569 , 9781369639476 , 10585475 , 10585475", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369639476, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1884185961?accountid=14496," 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0631 Ethnic studies"," 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0631 Ethnic studies",," 0459 Communication , 0558 Multimedia Communications , 0631 Ethnic studies"," Communication , Multimedia Communications , Ethnic studies"," Social sciences , Communication and the arts , Insurgent media , Non-profit marketing , Papua separatists , Social media , Soft power , Visual content analysis",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+Papua+Separatist+Group+and+Indonesia+in+the+Age+of+New+Public+Diplomacy%3A+A+Comparative+Analysis+of+Websites%2C+Facebook+Visuals%2C+and+Twitter&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Widinugraha%2C+Dwiyatna&amp;isbn=9781369639476&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"The dialectic of emancipation and repression in international human rights law,"The main objective of this thesis is to investigate, using the dialectical method, why human rights are not only just emancipatory in the international context but are also often used for the legitimation of repressive policies. The argument in this thesis accepts that human rights have an important role in the general development of international law, and that their historical development has had a transformational effect on international politics. My thesis is that political groups have sought to mould political and social interactions by questioning and reshaping both the definitions and the system of human rights. In doing so, those actions – defined as political power – are used to legitimise new social and political constellations by changing the legal definitions of rights and by erecting new forms of protection. In the development of my argument, I analyse first the different historical moments in which significant transformations and redefinitions of human rights occurred. For that, I will identify two processes: the formalisation of rights (emancipatory) and their de-formalisation (repressive). Secondly, I will seek to show that these processes are politically constituted in a dialectic that operates in the implementation of such rights by the State in both domestic and international spheres. I shall then provide an interpretation that tries to explain how this dialectic has helped legitimise the system of international human rights. As a result, it can be observed that while in the West there was, domestically, an emancipatory movement able to formalise rights that progressively reached larger social groups, the same cannot be said for those who lived in the colonial world. Internationally, there have been different interpretations that prevented the expansion and implementation of human rights on the same basis as in the domestic sphere. The dialectic of emancipation and repression, therefore, can be visualised by looking, historically, at political struggles between formalising and de-formalising forces.",1885883414,,Dissertations & Theses," Da Rosa, William Torres LaureanoDa RosaTorres LaureanoWilliamDa Rosa, William Torres Laureano",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321573907 , 105094762 , 101309 , 10588894 , 10588894 , http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/64069/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1885883414?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://sro.sussex.ac.uk/64069/ , (UMI)AAI10588894 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=The+dialectic+of+emancipation+and+repression+in+international+human+rights+law&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Da+Rosa%2C+William+Torres+Laureano&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Community-economic initiatives: the psychology and organisation of grassroots sustainability,"Ecovillages, Timebanks and a Local Exchange Trading Schemes are part of global social movements as well as offering innovative approaches to local sustainability.

Five individuals were interviewed from each group and interviews were analysed using Interpretive Phenomenological Analysis. Secondary data sources also contributed to a broad analysis of group processes and contexts. Diverging from traditional approaches, this multi-level, interdisciplinary account is able to capture more of the complex reality of these organisations than would be possible within a single discipline or through focussing on a single element of group membership. Indeed this comprehensive approach to studying community-based models for sustainability is the unique contribution of this study, moving forward methodological debates in this field. Findings that emerged from this study emphasise group members’ motivation to enhance their personal resilience. Participation provided members with a sense of agency and community connection, as well as being a means to express alternative cultural identities. Informal reciprocal exchange was also preferred to more formal exchange practices, with implications for the understanding and development of community exchange systems. This study widens the focus of environmental psychology to include socio-economic practices, and contributes towards the growing interdisciplinary field of complementary currencies and grassroots innovation. Finally, it provides a template for the evaluation of sustainable community-economic initiatives more generally. The thesis concludes that these initiatives and their wider movements are a promising avenue for research and development in sustainability.",1885886256,,Dissertations & Theses," Smith, CarmenSmithCarmenSmith, Carmen",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321574647 , 105094792 , 101309 , 10590073 , 10590073 , http://opus.bath.ac.uk/53207/", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016,, English, English,,2016,PQDT - UK & Ireland,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1885886256?accountid=14496, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, 9998 No UMI subject assigned, Bibliographic information obtained from the British Library., 9998 No UMI subject assigned, No UMI subject assigned," http://opus.bath.ac.uk/53207/ , (UMI)AAI10590073 , Social sciences",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Community-economic+initiatives%3A+the+psychology+and+organisation+of+grassroots+sustainability&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Smith%2C+Carmen&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses: UK & Ireland,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global""George Crumb's personal response to the Golden Age of social activism: ""Night of the Four Moons"", ""Black Angels"", and ""Vox Balaenae""","American composer George Crumb (b. 1929) started to garner public attention in the 1960s with a new kind of message and sound. Crumb’s approach to composition has been to exploit music as a form of communication to convey the metaphysical and the psychological through various mediums. With the social movements in the 1960s, many Americans were inspired to fight for change; as for Crumb, composing became his platform for social commentary. His approach to social activism was to express his ideas through musical dialogues and symbolism. The subtle quotations that he often borrowed from other composers are typically short in length, but their roles are significant in that they convey a deeper meaning and provide a broader context to his piece. This document aims to identify the motivations and the historical connections behind the symbolism in Crumb’s pivotal chamber works, as well as discuss his musical contributions to social activism and his intended effect. Indeed the impact may have extended beyond the average listening audience to influence future generation of composers as well. I will explore such composers who followed Crumb’s lead and utilized music as a platform for social activism. Three of Crumb’s chamber works composed between 1969 and 1971 will be examined: • Night of the Four Moons (1969) reflects Crumb’s ambivalent feelings about the Apollo 11 mission to the moon in 1969. The texts were extracted from four of Federico García Lorca’s poems. Understanding the four original poems by Lorca provides a more complete context by which to interpret the metaphors Crumb used. • Black Angels (1970) demonstrates the state of anger and darkness born by the Vietnam War. Crumb used numerology as a cohesive element, specifically the prime numbers 7 and 13 to represent the essential polarity – God versus Devil. The numerological symbolism is variously expressed in the musical structure, including phrase length, groupings of notes, time brackets, numbers of changes, and more. He also alluded to tonal music to represent the harmonious and God, and atonal to represent the current chaotic state. • Vox Balaenae (1971) is an ecological piece, which Crumb utilized the flute to suggest the sounds of a whale after being inspired by a recording of a singing humpback whale. This work provided a distinct musical voice to the world’s first anti-whaling campaign launched by the environmental non-profit organization, Greenpeace, in 1975, which eventually ignited a global “Save the Whales” movement. Additionally, the adaptation of Strauss’s Also sprach Zarathustra theme contains metaphors about the evolution of mankind. This document aims to contribute to the available knowledge concerning the interpretation of Crumb’s compositions by providing new insights to help researchers and performers attain a deeper understanding of Crumb’s chamber works that involve social change movements between 1969 and 1971.",1886108400,,Dissertations & Theses," Tsai, Yi LingTsaiLingYiTsai, Yi Ling",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4321586671 , 107180202 , 66569 , 9781369688313 , 10248771 , 10248771", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369688313, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1886108400?accountid=14496, 0413 Music, 0413 Music, 0413 Music,, 0413 Music, Music," Communication and the arts , Classical contemporary composers , Crumb, George , Flute , Music activism , Social activism , Social change movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=George+Crumb%27s+personal+response+to+the+Golden+Age+of+social+activism%3A+%22Night+of+the+Four+Moons%22%2C+%22Black+Angels%22%2C+and+%22Vox+Balaenae%22&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Tsai%2C+Yi+Ling&amp;isbn=9781369688313&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"Modernist heritage conservation: an evaluation of theories and current practice,"This dissertation is concerned with the contentious issue of treating buildings of the recent past as part of a common architectural heritage to be protected. Specifically, it is concerned with issues of environmental compatibility, economic feasibility and social viability in the built environment. After an initial investigation of the topic generally, the research identifies the most pressing issues arising from the conservation of modernist heritage, whilst analysing key international cases emblematic of the Modern Movement. This approach develops a series of constructive observations that are intended to question the current conservation practice and that ensure that over-arching objectives of sustainability are met. A particular focus is given to recent practice in the U.K. Policies are considered in the light of the current theoretical and legislative framework, particularly highlighting English Heritage’s recent move since the late 1990s towards a more sustainable, integrated practice on post-war heritage. Originating from the theoretical roots of ‘Conservazione Integrata’, an Italian concept that was later promoted by the Council of Europe with the 1975 Charter of Architectural Heritage, the current idea of ‘Planned and Integrated Conservation’ has gradually replaced the traditional concept of restoration and preservation, whilst also facing the emerging dispute over sustainability. Through my research, I have investigated the discourse within international socially embedded contexts, where architectural heritage represents a source of social, environmental and economic values to be preserved and passed on to future generations.",1896027398,,Dissertations & Theses," Zamburlini, G.

While this interconnected system has allowed for greater variety and availability of food products throughout the world, linking local populations to global supply chains, it has also made these populations vulnerable to price and supply fluctuations throughout the world. This project investigates the mechanisms by which global shocks are felt and reacted to at the local level, using a comparative case study of food riots that occurred in South Asia in 2007 and 2008. Specifically, I focus on the local level political, economic, and social dynamics that interacted with global price increases to create or mollify violent protests. To illuminate these local factors, I draw on a variety of data, including extensive interviews collected throughout 2014 with residents of West Bengal, India and Dhaka, Bangladesh. Through a comparison of local characteristics and detailed explanations of riots from areas with and without riots, I test hypotheses on food riot occurrence developed by drawing on studies of historical and contemporary food riots as well as theories of social movements. This study finds support for moral economy theory and additional proposed factors in mobilizing the riots in West Bengal and Dhaka. In comparing riots in India to those in Bangladesh, this study complicates the depiction of food riots as a unique form of collective action, and instead demonstrates their resemblance to other forms of collective action, brought on by food insecurity.",1903626172,,Dissertations & Theses," Heslin, AlisonHeslinAlisonHeslin, Alison",, Database copyright ProQuest LLC; ProQuest does not claim copyright in the individual underlying works.," 4322607369 , 108836482 , 66569 , 9781369695076 , 10588940 , 10588940", Dissertation/Thesis, 2016, 9781369695076, English, English,,2016,ProQuest Dissertations and Theses,2016,https://search.proquest.com/docview/1903626172?accountid=14496," 0359 Food Science , 0404 Climate Change , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0359 Food Science , 0404 Climate Change , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," 0359 Food Science , 0404 Climate Change , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology",," 0359 Food Science , 0404 Climate Change , 0615 Political science , 0626 Sociology"," Food Science , Climate Change , Political science , Sociology"," Social sciences , Biological sciences , Earth sciences , Collective action , Food riots , Food security , Mobilization , Political economy , Social movements",http://ucelinks.cdlib.org:8888/sfx_local?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:dissertation&amp;genre=dissertations+%26+theses&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQuest+Dissertations+%26+Theses+Global&amp;atitle=&amp;title=Three+Meals+Away%3A+Crisis+and+Violence+in+the+Global+Food+System&amp;issn=&amp;date=2016-01-01&amp;volume=&amp;issue=&amp;spage=&amp;au=Heslin%2C+Alison&amp;isbn=9781369695076&amp;jtitle=&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,"ProQuest Dissertations & Theses A&I,ProQuest Dissertations & Theses Global"
